SPOCK,The Cage,Check the circuit.
SPOCK,The Cage,It can't be the screen then.
SPOCK,The Cage,"Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way."
SPOCK,The Cage,Their call letters check with a survey expedition.
SPOCK,The Cage,SS Columbia.
SPOCK,The Cage,It disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.
SPOCK,The Cage,Records show the Talos group has never been explored.
SPOCK,The Cage,"Solar system similar to Earth, eleven planets."
SPOCK,The Cage,"Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere."
SPOCK,The Cage,"We aren't going to go, to be certain?"
SPOCK,The Cage,Mister Spock here.
SPOCK,The Cage,"We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir."
SPOCK,The Cage,There are crash survivors on Talos.
SPOCK,The Cage,"Preliminary lab survey ready, sir."
SPOCK,The Cage,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,The Cage,Spock here.
SPOCK,The Cage,"There is no survivors' encampment, Number One."
SPOCK,The Cage,This is all some sort of trap.
SPOCK,The Cage,We've lost the Captain.
SPOCK,The Cage,Do you read?
SPOCK,The Cage,"The inhabitants of this planet must live deep underground, and probably manufacture food and other needs down there."
SPOCK,The Cage,"Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life."
SPOCK,The Cage,Exactly.
SPOCK,The Cage,An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's inhabitants.
SPOCK,The Cage,"They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth people are put together."
SPOCK,The Cage,Or it could be something more.
SPOCK,The Cage,Look.
SPOCK,The Cage,Brains three times the size of ours.
SPOCK,The Cage,"If we start buzzing about down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly."
SPOCK,The Cage,"Standing by, Number One."
SPOCK,The Cage,"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."
SPOCK,The Cage,Our circuits are beginning to heat.
SPOCK,The Cage,We'll have to cease power.
SPOCK,The Cage,We've located a magnetic field that seems to come from their underground generator.
SPOCK,The Cage,"If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could find oneself materialised inside solid rock."
SPOCK,The Cage,The women!
SPOCK,The Cage,Address intercraft.
SPOCK,The Cage,This is the acting captain speaking.
SPOCK,The Cage,We have no choice now but to consider the safety of this vessel and the remainder of the crew.
SPOCK,The Cage,We're leaving.
SPOCK,The Cage,All decks prepare for hyperdrive.
SPOCK,The Cage,Time warp factor.
SPOCK,The Cage,Engine room!
SPOCK,The Cage,Mister Spock here.
SPOCK,The Cage,Switch to rockets.
SPOCK,The Cage,We're blasting out.
SPOCK,The Cage,Nothing.
SPOCK,The Cage,But for the batteries we'd lose gravitation and oxygen.
SPOCK,The Cage,Could be we've waited too long.
SPOCK,The Cage,It's collecting all the information stored in this fly.
SPOCK,The Cage,They've decided to swat us.
SPOCK,The Cage,Mister Spock here.
TYLER,The Cage,"All operating, sir."
TYLER,The Cage,It could be these meteorites.
TYLER,The Cage,"It's coming at the speed of light, collision course."
TYLER,The Cage,"The meteorite beam has not deflected it, Captain."
TYLER,The Cage,I have a fix.
TYLER,The Cage,It comes from the Talos star group.
TYLER,The Cage,It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to here.
TYLER,The Cage,System open.
TYLER,The Cage,Course computed and on the screen.
TYLER,The Cage,"On course, sir."
TYLER,The Cage,"We've settled into orbit, sir."
TYLER,The Cage,Captain?
TYLER,The Cage,"Reflections, sir, from the planet's surface."
TYLER,The Cage,"As I read it, they polarise out as rounded metal bits."
TYLER,The Cage,Could be parts of a spaceship hull.
TYLER,The Cage,"Yes, sir."
TYLER,The Cage,And you won't believe how fast you can get back.
TYLER,The Cage,Well the time barrier's been broken.
TYLER,The Cage,Our new ships can
TYLER,The Cage,Captain!
TYLER,The Cage,Then why aren't we doing anything?
TYLER,The Cage,"That entry may have stood up against hand lasers, but we can transmit the ship's power against it."
TYLER,The Cage,Enough to blast half a continent.
TYLER,The Cage,It's Captain Pike they've got.
TYLER,The Cage,"He needs help, and he probably needs it fast."
TYLER,The Cage,"Mister Spock, the ship's controls have gone dead."
TYLER,The Cage,There's nothing.
TYLER,The Cage,Every system aboard is fading out.
TYLER,The Cage,The computers!
TYLER,The Cage,I can't shut it off.
TYLER,The Cage,It's running through our library.
TYLER,The Cage,"Tapes, micro-records, everything."
TYLER,The Cage,It doesn't make sense.
TYLER,The Cage,"All power has come on, Mister Spock."
TYLER,The Cage,The helm is answering to control.
TYLER,The Cage,"Eve, sir?"
TYLER,The Cage,"Yes, sir."
ONE,The Cage,"No, it's something else."
ONE,The Cage,There's still something out there.
ONE,The Cage,"Evasive manoeuvres, sir?"
ONE,The Cage,We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out.
ONE,The Cage,"Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years."
ONE,The Cage,"Yes, sir."
ONE,The Cage,"All decks have acknowledged, sir."
ONE,The Cage,"She's replacing your former yeoman, sir."
ONE,The Cage,"Of course, sir."
ONE,The Cage,"Landing party, come in."
ONE,The Cage,"Quarters are being prepared, sir."
ONE,The Cage,Have I permission to send out scouting and scientific parties now?
ONE,The Cage,"I didn't get that last message, Captain."
ONE,The Cage,"Landing party, come in."
ONE,The Cage,"So we just thought we saw survivors there, Mister Spock."
ONE,The Cage,Any estimate what they might want one of us for?
ONE,The Cage,Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power.
ONE,The Cage,We'll try blasting through that metal.
ONE,The Cage,"All circuits engaged, Mister Spock."
ONE,The Cage,Take cover.
ONE,The Cage,Increase to full power!
ONE,The Cage,Can you give us any more?
ONE,The Cage,Disengage.
ONE,The Cage,The top of that knoll should have been sheared off the first second.
ONE,The Cage,"Now, you all know the situation."
ONE,The Cage,We're hoping to transport down inside the Talosian community.
ONE,The Cage,Nothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out.
ONE,The Cage,Captain!
ONE,The Cage,Captain.
ONE,The Cage,But we were a party of six.
ONE,The Cage,They were fully charged when we left.
ONE,The Cage,It's dead.
ONE,The Cage,(communicator) I can't make a signal.
ONE,The Cage,What is it?
ONE,The Cage,Offspring as in he's Adam.
ONE,The Cage,Is that it?
ONE,The Cage,"Well, shall we do a little time computation?"
ONE,The Cage,There was a Vina listed on that expedition as an adult crewman.
ONE,The Cage,"Now, adding eighteen years to your age then."
ONE,The Cage,Captain.
ONE,The Cage,"They kept us from seeing this, too."
ONE,The Cage,We cut through and never knew it.
ONE,The Cage,Captain.
ONE,The Cage,It's wrong to create a whole race of humans to live as slaves.
ONE,The Cage,"Captain, we have transporter control now."
ONE,The Cage,Isn't she coming with us?
ONE,The Cage,Yeoman!
ONE,The Cage,You've delivered your report.
ONE,The Cage,"All decks show ready, sir."
PIKE,The Cage,Steady as we go.
PIKE,The Cage,They were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this way.
PIKE,The Cage,If they survived the crash.
PIKE,The Cage,"Not without any indication of survivors, no."
PIKE,The Cage,Continue to the Vega Colony and take care of our own sick and injured first.
PIKE,The Cage,You have the helm.
PIKE,The Cage,Maintain present course.
PIKE,The Cage,"Drop by my cabin, Doctor."
PIKE,The Cage,(Boyce enters with bag) What's that?
PIKE,The Cage,I didn't say there's anything wrong with me.
PIKE,The Cage,That's right.
PIKE,The Cage,"Unless we get anything more positive on it, it seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent."
PIKE,The Cage,"I'd like to log the ship's doctor's opinion, too."
PIKE,The Cage,Good.
PIKE,The Cage,"I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the Vega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also."
PIKE,The Cage,"What the devil are you putting in there, ice?"
PIKE,The Cage,What makes you think I need one?
PIKE,The Cage,Shouldn't it be?
PIKE,The Cage,"My only yeoman and two others dead, seven injured."
PIKE,The Cage,"Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the armour."
PIKE,The Cage,"Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted fortress and attacked by one of their warriors."
PIKE,The Cage,You bet I'm tired.
PIKE,The Cage,You bet.
PIKE,The Cage,I'm tired of being responsible for two hundred and three lives.
PIKE,The Cage,"I'm tired of deciding which mission is too risky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who doesn't, and who lives and who dies."
PIKE,The Cage,"Boy, I've had it, Phil."
PIKE,The Cage,To the point of considering resigning.
PIKE,The Cage,"Well, for one thing, go home."
PIKE,The Cage,Nice little town with fifty miles of parkland around it.
PIKE,The Cage,"Remember I told you I had two horses, and we used to take some food and ride out all day."
PIKE,The Cage,I said that's one place I might go.
PIKE,The Cage,I might go into business on Regulus or on the Orion colony.
PIKE,The Cage,The point is this isn't the only life available.
PIKE,The Cage,There's a whole galaxy of things to choose from.
PIKE,The Cage,"Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender."
PIKE,The Cage,Address intercraft.
PIKE,The Cage,This is the captain.
PIKE,The Cage,Our destination is the Talos star group.
PIKE,The Cage,"Our time warp, factor seven."
PIKE,The Cage,Yeoman.
PIKE,The Cage,I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge
PIKE,The Cage,"Oh, I see."
PIKE,The Cage,Thank you.
PIKE,The Cage,"She does a good job, all right."
PIKE,The Cage,It's just that I can't get used to having a woman on the bridge.
PIKE,The Cage,"No offence, Lieutenant."
PIKE,The Cage,"You're different, of course."
PIKE,The Cage,Spectography?
PIKE,The Cage,Gravity?
PIKE,The Cage,Prep a landing party of six.
PIKE,The Cage,You feel up to it?
PIKE,The Cage,"Sorry, Number One."
PIKE,The Cage,"With little information on this planet, we'll have to leave the ship's most experienced officer here covering us."
PIKE,The Cage,"There's no indication of problems down there, but let's not take chances."
PIKE,The Cage,"Captain Christopher Pike, United Space Ship Enterprise."
PIKE,The Cage,"The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon."
PIKE,The Cage,(as the survivors pack up the settlement) Enterprise.
PIKE,The Cage,We'll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to you very shortly.
PIKE,The Cage,That's affirmative on the
PIKE,The Cage,"Er, affirmative on request."
PIKE,The Cage,Landing party out.
PIKE,The Cage,I don't understand.
PIKE,The Cage,Can you hear me?
PIKE,The Cage,"My name is Christopher Pike, commander of the space vehicle Enterprise from a stellar group at the other end of this galaxy."
PIKE,The Cage,Our intentions are peaceful.
PIKE,The Cage,Can you understand me?
PIKE,The Cage,"You're not speaking, yet I can hear you."
PIKE,The Cage,"All right then, telepathy."
PIKE,The Cage,You can read my mind.
PIKE,The Cage,I can read yours.
PIKE,The Cage,"Now, unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an unfriendly act"
PIKE,The Cage,"If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these walls, too?"
PIKE,The Cage,"There's a way out of any cage, and I'll find it."
PIKE,The Cage,This is Rigel Seven.
PIKE,The Cage,"I was in a cage, a cell, in some kind of a zoo."
PIKE,The Cage,I must still be there.
PIKE,The Cage,They've reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere I've been.
PIKE,The Cage,It's starting just as it happened two weeks ago.
PIKE,The Cage,Except for you.
PIKE,The Cage,"Longer hair, different dress, but it is you, the one the survivors called Vina."
PIKE,The Cage,Or rather the image of Vina.
PIKE,The Cage,But why you again?
PIKE,The Cage,Why didn't they create a different girl?
PIKE,The Cage,But it's only a dream.
PIKE,The Cage,You can tell my jailers I won't go along with it.
PIKE,The Cage,I'm not an animal performing for its supper.
PIKE,The Cage,Why would an illusion be frightened?
PIKE,The Cage,Who are you?
PIKE,The Cage,You act as if this were really you.
PIKE,The Cage,Why are you here?
PIKE,The Cage,Are you real?
PIKE,The Cage,"No, no."
PIKE,The Cage,"No, that's not an answer."
PIKE,The Cage,"I've never met you before, never even imagined you."
PIKE,The Cage,"What, and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear?"
PIKE,The Cage,So they can see how their specimen performs?
PIKE,The Cage,"They want to see how I react, is that it?"
PIKE,The Cage,Or do they do more than just watch me?
PIKE,The Cage,"Do they feel with me, too?"
PIKE,The Cage,Yes.
PIKE,The Cage,"Yes, you can please me."
PIKE,The Cage,You can tell me about them.
PIKE,The Cage,"Is there any way I can keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts against me?"
PIKE,The Cage,Does that frighten you?
PIKE,The Cage,Does that mean there is a way?
PIKE,The Cage,"Since you're not real, there's not much point in continuing this conversation, is there."
PIKE,The Cage,How far can they control my mind?
PIKE,The Cage,Perhaps.
PIKE,The Cage,But they try to trick me with their illusions.
PIKE,The Cage,Did they ever live on the surface of this planet?
PIKE,The Cage,Why did they go underground?
PIKE,The Cage,That's why it's so barren up there?
PIKE,The Cage,So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and they concentrated on developing their mental power.
PIKE,The Cage,Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.
PIKE,The Cage,Which means they had to have more than one of each animal.
PIKE,The Cage,They'll need a pair of humans too.
PIKE,The Cage,Where do they get intend to get the Earth woman?
PIKE,The Cage,But that was a bargain with something that didn't exist.
PIKE,The Cage,"You said you weren't real, remember?"
PIKE,The Cage,Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals?
PIKE,The Cage,And if I prefer
PIKE,The Cage,Why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind?
PIKE,The Cage,"Because you can't, can you?"
PIKE,The Cage,"You do have limitations, don't you?"
PIKE,The Cage,That's very interesting.
PIKE,The Cage,You were startled.
PIKE,The Cage,Weren't you reading my mind then?
PIKE,The Cage,"No, let's stay on the first subject."
PIKE,The Cage,All I wanted for that moment was to get my hands around your neck.
PIKE,The Cage,Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through?
PIKE,The Cage,"All right, all right, let's talk about the girl."
PIKE,The Cage,"You seem to be going out of your way to make her attractive, to make me feel protective."
PIKE,The Cage,It seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and like her.
PIKE,The Cage,"Assuming that's a lie, why would you want me attracted to her?"
PIKE,The Cage,So I'll feel love in a husband-wife relationship?
PIKE,The Cage,That would be necessary only if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human community.
PIKE,The Cage,You mean properly punished!
PIKE,The Cage,I'm the one who's not co-operating!
PIKE,The Cage,Why don't you punish me?
PIKE,The Cage,Tango!
PIKE,The Cage,"You old devil, you."
PIKE,The Cage,I'm sorry I don't have any sugar.
PIKE,The Cage,"Well, they think of everything, don't they?"
PIKE,The Cage,(feeds lumps to the horse)
PIKE,The Cage,They read our minds very well.
PIKE,The Cage,"Home, anything else I want, if I co-operate, is that it?"
PIKE,The Cage,"Look, I'm sorry they punish you, but we can't let them"
PIKE,The Cage,It's funny.
PIKE,The Cage,It's about twenty four hours ago I was telling the ship's doctor how much I wanted something else not very different from what we have here.
PIKE,The Cage,An escape from reality.
PIKE,The Cage,Life with no frustrations.
PIKE,The Cage,No responsibilities.
PIKE,The Cage,"Now that I have it, I understand the doctor's answer."
PIKE,The Cage,"You either live life, bruises, skinned knees and all, or you turn your back on it and start dying."
PIKE,The Cage,"The doctor's going to be happy about one part, at least."
PIKE,The Cage,He said I needed a rest.
PIKE,The Cage,I used to ride through here when I was a kid.
PIKE,The Cage,"It's not as pretty as some of the parkland around the big cities, but."
PIKE,The Cage,That's Mojave.
PIKE,The Cage,That's where I was born.
PIKE,The Cage,"These headaches, they'll be hereditary you know."
PIKE,The Cage,Would you wish them on a child or a whole group of children?
PIKE,The Cage,Is it?
PIKE,The Cage,"Look, first they made me protect you and then feel sympathy for you."
PIKE,The Cage,Now we have these familiar surroundings and a comfortable husband-wife relationship.
PIKE,The Cage,They don't need all this for just passion.
PIKE,The Cage,What they're after is respect and mutual dependence.
PIKE,The Cage,"But we're not here, neither of us."
PIKE,The Cage,"We're in a menagerie, a cage!"
PIKE,The Cage,"Back in my cage, it seemed for a couple of minutes that our keeper couldn't read my thoughts."
PIKE,The Cage,"Do emotions like hate, keeping hate in your mind, does that block off our mind from them?"
PIKE,The Cage,"Oh, no."
PIKE,The Cage,I don't hate you.
PIKE,The Cage,I can guess what it was like.
PIKE,The Cage,"If they can read my mind, then they know I'm attracted to you."
PIKE,The Cage,I was from the very first moment I saw you in the survivor's camp.
PIKE,The Cage,Vina?
PIKE,The Cage,ORION: Glistening green.
PIKE,The Cage,Almost like secret dreams a bored ship captain might have.
PIKE,The Cage,(grabbing Colt's laser pistol) They don't work.
PIKE,The Cage,Don't say anything.
PIKE,The Cage,"I'm filling my mind with a picture of beating their huge, misshapen heads to pulp, thoughts so primitive they black out everything else."
PIKE,The Cage,I'm filling my mind with hate.
PIKE,The Cage,I'll break out of this zoo somehow and get to you.
PIKE,The Cage,Is your blood red like ours?
PIKE,The Cage,I'm going to find out.
PIKE,The Cage,All I want to do is get my hands on you.
PIKE,The Cage,Can you read these thoughts?
PIKE,The Cage,"Images of hate, killing?"
PIKE,The Cage,You'll find my thoughts more interesting.
PIKE,The Cage,Thoughts so primitive you can't understand.
PIKE,The Cage,Emotions so ugly (stricken by pain)
PIKE,The Cage,No.
PIKE,The Cage,"No, don't help me."
PIKE,The Cage,I have to concentrate.
PIKE,The Cage,They can't read through hate.
PIKE,The Cage,"Now you hold still, or I'll break your neck."
PIKE,The Cage,I've had some samples of how good they are.
PIKE,The Cage,"You stop this illusion, or I'll twist your head off."
PIKE,The Cage,"(it stops) All right, now you try one more illusion, you try anything at all, and I'll break your neck."
PIKE,The Cage,I'm going to gamble you're too intelligent to kill for no reason at all.
PIKE,The Cage,"On the other hand, I've got a reason."
PIKE,The Cage,I'm willing to bet you've created an illusion this laser is empty.
PIKE,The Cage,I think it just blasted a hole in that window and you're keep us from seeing it.
PIKE,The Cage,You want me to test my theory out on your head?
PIKE,The Cage,"Make contact, Number One."
PIKE,The Cage,I want to contact our ship.
PIKE,The Cage,And start by burying you?
PIKE,The Cage,"Look, I'll make a deal with you."
PIKE,The Cage,You and your life for the lives of these two Earth women.
PIKE,The Cage,Do you understand what I'm saying?
PIKE,The Cage,"You give me proof that our ship is all right, send these two back, and I'll stay with Vina."
PIKE,The Cage,The weapon is building up an overload.
PIKE,The Cage,A force chamber explosion.
PIKE,The Cage,You still have time to get underground.
PIKE,The Cage,"Well, go on!"
PIKE,The Cage,"(pushes Vina away) Just to show you how primitive humans are, Talosian, you go with her."
PIKE,The Cage,Wait.
PIKE,The Cage,And that's it?
PIKE,The Cage,No apologies?
PIKE,The Cage,"You captured one of us, threatened all of us."
PIKE,The Cage,"But wouldn't some form of trade, mutual co-operation?"
PIKE,The Cage,Let's get back to the ship.
PIKE,The Cage,You'll give her back her illusion of beauty?
PIKE,The Cage,No.
PIKE,The Cage,"No, and I agreed with her reasons."
PIKE,The Cage,"Oh, I feel fine, just fine."
PIKE,The Cage,"You recommended a rest, a change of pace, didn't you?"
PIKE,The Cage,I've even been home.
PIKE,The Cage,Does that make you happy?
PIKE,The Cage,Yeoman.
PIKE,The Cage,I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge I
PIKE,The Cage,Oh.
PIKE,The Cage,Oh yes.
PIKE,The Cage,The reports.
PIKE,The Cage,Thank you.
PIKE,The Cage,As in all ship's doctors are dirty old men.
PIKE,The Cage,"What are we running here, a cadet ship, Number One?"
PIKE,The Cage,Are we ready or not?
PIKE,The Cage,Engage.
GARISON,The Cage,"It's a radio wave, sir."
GARISON,The Cage,We're passing through an old-style distress signal.
GARISON,The Cage,"A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir."
GARISON,The Cage,That's it.
GARISON,The Cage,No other message.
GARISON,The Cage,(reads) Eleven survivors from crash.
GARISON,The Cage,Gravity and oxygen within limits.
GARISON,The Cage,"Food and water obtainable, but unless."
GARISON,The Cage,"The message faded at that point, sir."
GARISON,The Cage,Sir.
GARISON,The Cage,Could that be an illusion too?
GARISON,The Cage,"Open, sir."
GARISON,The Cage,Open.
GARISON,The Cage,The captain?
BOYCE,The Cage,I understand we picked up a distress signal.
BOYCE,The Cage,"Oh, I concur with yours, definitely."
BOYCE,The Cage,Who wants a warm martini?
BOYCE,The Cage,Sometimes a man'll tell his bartender things he'll never tell his doctor.
BOYCE,The Cage,"What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel Seven?"
BOYCE,The Cage,Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it?
BOYCE,The Cage,"Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet."
BOYCE,The Cage,"You treat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now you're tired and you"
BOYCE,The Cage,"To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave?"
BOYCE,The Cage,And do what?
BOYCE,The Cage,"Ah, that sounds exciting."
BOYCE,The Cage,Ride out with a picnic lunch every day.
BOYCE,The Cage,"You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves?"
BOYCE,The Cage,Not for you.
BOYCE,The Cage,"A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away."
BOYCE,The Cage,Take your choice.
BOYCE,The Cage,We both get the same two kinds of customers.
BOYCE,The Cage,The living and the dying.
BOYCE,The Cage,"If they can spare you a moment, I'd like to make my medical report."
BOYCE,The Cage,Their health is excellent.
BOYCE,The Cage,Almost too good.
BOYCE,The Cage,It was a perfect illusion.
BOYCE,The Cage,"They had us seeing just what we wanted to see, human beings who'd survived with dignity and bravery, everything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp, the tattered clothing, everything."
BOYCE,The Cage,Now let's be sure we understand the danger of this.
BOYCE,The Cage,The inhabitants of this planet can read our minds.
BOYCE,The Cage,"They can create illusions out of a person's own thoughts, memories, and experiences, even out of a person's own desires."
BOYCE,The Cage,Illusions just as real and solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore.
BOYCE,The Cage,Maybe it was.
BOYCE,The Cage,It's what I tried to explain in the briefing room.
BOYCE,The Cage,"Their power of illusion is so great, we can't be sure of anything we do, anything we see."
BOYCE,The Cage,Hold on a minute.
BOYCE,The Cage,You look a hundred percent better.
BOYCE,The Cage,Eve as in Adam?
COLT,The Cage,"Yes, sir."
COLT,The Cage,But you wanted the reports by oh five hundred.
COLT,The Cage,"It's oh five hundred now, sir."
COLT,The Cage,We were the only ones transported.
COLT,The Cage,Leave him alone.
COLT,The Cage,Picked her?
COLT,The Cage,For what?
COLT,The Cage,I don't understand.
COLT,The Cage,"Offspring, as in children?"
COLT,The Cage,Captain.
COLT,The Cage,What's happened to Vina?
COLT,The Cage,"Yes, sir."
COLT,The Cage,"Sir, I was wondering."
COLT,The Cage,Just curious.
COLT,The Cage,Who would have been Eve?
COLT,The Cage,"Yes, ma'am."
COLT,The Cage,"Yes, sir."
GEOLOGIST,The Cage,"Geological lab report complete, Captain."
GEOLOGIST,The Cage,"Our reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere, sir, heavy with inert elements but well within safety limits."
GEOLOGIST,The Cage,Zero point nine of Earth.
PITCAIRN,The Cage,"Yes, sir."
PITCAIRN,The Cage,There's a canyon to the left.
PITCAIRN,The Cage,We can set you there completely unobserved.
PITCAIRN,The Cage,"All systems are out, bridge."
PITCAIRN,The Cage,We've got nothing.
PITCAIRN,The Cage,"Sir, it just came on."
PITCAIRN,The Cage,We can't shut the power off.
PITCAIRN,The Cage,"Mister Spock, the system is coming on again."
OLD MAN,The Cage,They're men.
OLD MAN,The Cage,They're humans.
HASKINS,The Cage,"Doctor Theodore Haskins, American Continent lnstitute."
HASKINS,The Cage,This is Vina.
HASKINS,The Cage,Her parents are dead.
HASKINS,The Cage,She was born almost as we crashed.
HASKINS,The Cage,"You must forgive her choice of words, Captain."
HASKINS,The Cage,She's lived her whole life with a collection of aging scientists.
HASKINS,The Cage,"There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt if Earth is ready to learn the secret."
HASKINS,The Cage,Let the girl show you.
HASKINS,The Cage,We'll accept your judgment.
SURVIVOR,The Cage,Is Earth all right?
VINA,The Cage,"You appear to be healthy and intelligent, Captain."
VINA,The Cage,A prime specimen.
VINA,The Cage,I think it's time to show the Captain our secret.
VINA,The Cage,"You're tired, but don't worry."
VINA,The Cage,You'll feel much better soon.
VINA,The Cage,Don't you see it?
VINA,The Cage,Here and here.
VINA,The Cage,You will.
VINA,The Cage,You're a perfect choice.
VINA,The Cage,"Come on, we must hide ourselves."
VINA,The Cage,"Come, come."
VINA,The Cage,Hurry.
VINA,The Cage,It's deserted.
VINA,The Cage,There'll be weapons and perhaps food.
VINA,The Cage,"Please, we must hide ourselves."
VINA,The Cage,Come on.
VINA,The Cage,The killer!
VINA,The Cage,Quick.
VINA,The Cage,If you attack while it's not looking.
VINA,The Cage,You have to kill him as you did here before.
VINA,The Cage,"It doesn't matter what you call this, you'll feel it."
VINA,The Cage,That's what matters.
VINA,The Cage,You'll feel every moment of whatever happens to you.
VINA,The Cage,"Please, don't you know what he'll do to us?"
VINA,The Cage,Because that's the way you imagined me.
VINA,The Cage,Careful.
VINA,The Cage,It's over.
VINA,The Cage,To please you.
VINA,The Cage,As real as you wish.
VINA,The Cage,Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten.
VINA,The Cage,"I have to wear something, don't I?"
VINA,The Cage,"I can wear whatever you wish, be anything you wish."
VINA,The Cage,"Don't you have a dream, something you've always wanted very badly?"
VINA,The Cage,You can have whatever dream you want.
VINA,The Cage,"I can become anything, any woman you've ever imagined."
VINA,The Cage,You can have anything you want in the whole universe.
VINA,The Cage,Let me please you.
VINA,The Cage,You're a fool.
VINA,The Cage,"Perhaps if you asked me some questions, I could answer."
VINA,The Cage,"If I tell you, then will you pick some dream you've had and let me live it with you?"
VINA,The Cage,They can't actually make you do anything you don't want to do.
VINA,The Cage,"And, they can punish you when you're not co-operative."
VINA,The Cage,You'll find out about that.
VINA,The Cage,"War, thousands of centuries ago."
VINA,The Cage,But they found it's a trap.
VINA,The Cage,Like a narcotic.
VINA,The Cage,"Because when dreams become more important than reality, you give up travel, building, creating."
VINA,The Cage,You even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors.
VINA,The Cage,"You just sit, living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought record."
VINA,The Cage,You're better than a theatre to them.
VINA,The Cage,"They create the illusion for you, they watch you react, feel your emotions."
VINA,The Cage,"They have a whole collection of specimens, descendants of life brought back long ago from all over this part of the galaxy."
VINA,The Cage,Please.
VINA,The Cage,You said that if I answered questions
VINA,The Cage,I'm a woman as real and as human as you are.
VINA,The Cage,We're like Adam and Eve.
VINA,The Cage,If we.
VINA,The Cage,Don't.
VINA,The Cage,Please don't punish me!
VINA,The Cage,(disappears)
VINA,The Cage,"You want some coffee, dear?"
VINA,The Cage,I left the thermos hooked to my saddle.
VINA,The Cage,"Hey, your coffee."
VINA,The Cage,Is it good to be home?
VINA,The Cage,"Have you forgotten my headaches, darling?"
VINA,The Cage,I get them when you talk strangely like this.
VINA,The Cage,"My, it turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it?"
VINA,The Cage,I hope you're hungry.
VINA,The Cage,These little white sandwiches are your mother's recipe for chicken tuna.
VINA,The Cage,This is a lovely place to rest.
VINA,The Cage,Is that supposed to be news to your wife?
VINA,The Cage,You're home.
VINA,The Cage,You can even stay if you want.
VINA,The Cage,Wouldn't it be nice showing your children where you once played?
VINA,The Cage,Foolish.
VINA,The Cage,They say in the olden days all this was a desert.
VINA,The Cage,Blowing sand and cactus.
VINA,The Cage,No.
VINA,The Cage,Stop it.
VINA,The Cage,Don't you care what they'll do to us?
VINA,The Cage,Yes.
VINA,The Cage,They can't read through primitive emotions.
VINA,The Cage,But you can't keep it up for long enough.
VINA,The Cage,I've tried.
VINA,The Cage,"They keep at you and at you year after year, tricking and punishing, and they won."
VINA,The Cage,They own me.
VINA,The Cage,I know you must hate me for that.
VINA,The Cage,But that's not enough.
VINA,The Cage,Don't you see?
VINA,The Cage,"They read my thoughts, my feelings, my dreams of what would be a perfect man."
VINA,The Cage,That's why they picked you.
VINA,The Cage,I can't help but love you and they expect you to feel the same way.
VINA,The Cage,I'm beginning to see why none of this has worked for you.
VINA,The Cage,"You've been home, and fighting as on Rigel."
VINA,The Cage,"That's not new to you, either."
VINA,The Cage,A person's strongest dreams are about what he can't do.
VINA,The Cage,"Yes, a ship's captain, always having to be so formal, so decent and honest and proper."
VINA,The Cage,You must wonder what it would be like to forget all that.
VINA,The Cage,No!
VINA,The Cage,Let me finish!
VINA,The Cage,It's not fair.
VINA,The Cage,You don't need them.
VINA,The Cage,How long can you block your thoughts?
VINA,The Cage,"A few minutes, an hour?"
VINA,The Cage,How can that help?
VINA,The Cage,He doesn't need you.
VINA,The Cage,He's already picked me.
VINA,The Cage,"Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring."
VINA,The Cage,You're no better choice.
VINA,The Cage,They'd have more luck crossing him with a computer.
VINA,The Cage,It's not fair.
VINA,The Cage,I did what you asked.
VINA,The Cage,Don't hurt them.
VINA,The Cage,They don't mean to be evil.
VINA,The Cage,"He's not bluffing, Captain."
VINA,The Cage,With illusion they can make your crew work the wrong controls or push any button it takes to destroy your ship.
VINA,The Cage,What is that?
VINA,The Cage,"If, if you all think it's this important, then I can't go either."
VINA,The Cage,"I suppose if they have one human being, they might try again."
VINA,The Cage,He means that they can't use you.
VINA,The Cage,You're free to go back to the ship.
VINA,The Cage,I can't.
VINA,The Cage,I can't go with you.
VINA,The Cage,You see why I can't go with you.
VINA,The Cage,"They found me in the wreckage, dying."
VINA,The Cage,A lump of flesh.
VINA,The Cage,They rebuilt me.
VINA,The Cage,Everything works.
VINA,The Cage,But they had never seen a human.
VINA,The Cage,They had no guide for putting me back together.
TALOSIAN,The Cage,"It appears, Magistrate, that the intelligence of the specimen is shockingly limited."
TALOSIAN,The Cage,"Thousands of us are already probing the creature's thoughts, Magistrate."
TALOSIAN,The Cage,We find excellent memory capacity.
TALOSIAN,The Cage,A curious species.
TALOSIAN,The Cage,They have fantasies they hide even from themselves.
TALOSIAN,The Cage,Their method of storing records is crude and consumed much time.
TALOSIAN,The Cage,Are you prepared to assimilate it?
TALOSIAN,The Cage,Your unsuitability has condemned the Talosian race to eventual death.
TALOSIAN,The Cage,Is this not sufficient?
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,This is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so easily with a simulated message.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"As you can read in its thoughts, it is only now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were a simple illusion we placed in their minds."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,You will note the confusion as it reads our thought transmissions.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,You now see the primitive fear threat reaction.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"The specimen is about to boast of his strength, the weaponry of his vessel, and so on."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"Next, frustrated into a need to display physical prowess, the creature will throw himself against the transparency."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"Despite its frustration, the creature appears more adaptable than our specimens from other planets."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,We can soon begin the experiment.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,I read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it fought to protect its life.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"We will begin with this, giving the specimen something more interesting to protect."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,The vial contains a nourishing protein complex.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"If the form and the colour is not appealing, it can appear as any food you wish to visualise."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,To starve?
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,You overlook the unpleasant alternative of punishment.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,From a fable you once heard in childhood.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,You will now consume the nourishment.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"If you continue to disobey, from deeper in your mind, there are things even more unpleasant."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,Now to the female.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"As you've conjectured, an Earth vessel did crash on our planet, but with only a single survivor."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,We repaired the survivor's injuries and found the species interesting.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,It became necessary to attract a mate.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,This is necessary in order to perpetuate the species.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,With the female now properly conditioned.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"First, an emotion of protectiveness."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,Now one of sympathy.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,Excellent.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"Since you resist the present specimen, you now have a selection."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,Each of the two new specimens has qualities in her favour.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,The female you call Number One has the superior mind and would produce highly intelligent children.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"Although she seems to lack emotion, this is largely a pretence."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,She has often has fantasies involving you.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,The other new arrival has considered you unreachable but now is realising this has changed.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"The factors in her favour are youth and strength, plus unusually strong female drives."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,Wrong thinking is punishable.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,Right thinking will be as quickly rewarded.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,You will find it an effective combination.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,Your ship.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,Release me or we'll destroy it.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,You are now on the surface where we wished you to be.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"With the female of your choice, you will now begin carefully guided lives."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,That is your choice.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"To help you reclaim the planet's surface, our zoological gardens will furnish a variety of plant life."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"Since our lifespan is many times yours, we have time to evolve you into a society trained to serve as artisans, technicians"
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,Is this a deception?
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,Do you intend to destroy yourselves?
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,We had not believed this possible.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,The customs and history of your race show a unique hatred of captivity.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,"Even when it's pleasant and benevolent, you prefer death."
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,This makes you too violent and dangerous a species for our needs.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,No other specimen has shown your adaptability.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,You were our last hope.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,Your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy itself too.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,This is the female's true appearance.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,It was necessary to convince you her desire to stay is an honest one.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,And more.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,She has an illusion and you have reality.
MAGISTRATE,The Cage,May you find your way as pleasant.
OFFICER,The Cage,"Nice place you have here, Mister Pike."
OFFICER,The Cage,Funny how they are on this planet.
OFFICER,The Cage,They actually like being taken advantage of.
OFFICER,The Cage,"Suppose you had all of space to choose from, and this was only one small sample."
ORION,The Cage,Wouldn't you say it was worth a man's soul?
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Your move, Captain."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",I'll have you checkmated your next move.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Irritating?
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Ah, yes."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",One of your Earth emotions.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",The fact one of my ancestors married a human female
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Not large enough even for a lifeboat.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",More like destroyed the ship in this case.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Look at it.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Burnt,
pitted."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",He played most illogically.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","His next move should have been the
rook."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",The tapes are burnt out.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Trying the memory banks.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Getting something from the recorder now.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Decoding memory banks.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",I'll try to interpolate.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","The Valiant had
encountered a magnetic space storm and was being swept in this
direction."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Swept past this point, about a half light year out of the
galaxy, they were thrown clear, turned, and headed back into the galaxy
here."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",I'm not getting it all.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",The tapes are pretty badly burned.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Sounds
like the ship had encountered some unknown force."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Now, orders, counter
orders, repeated urgent requests for information from the ship's
computer records for anything concerning ESP in human beings."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Severe damage.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Seven crewmen dead.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","No, make that six."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","One
crewman seemed to have recovered."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","That's when they became interested in
extrasensory perception."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","More than interested, almost frantic about it."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","No, this must be garbled."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",I get something about destruct.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","I must have
read it wrong."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","It sounded like the captain giving an order to destroy
his own ship."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Force field of some kind.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Sensor beam on.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Deflectors full intensity.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Deflectors say there's something there, sensors say there isn't."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Density negative.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Radiation negative.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Energy negative.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Negative!
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Damage control reports, all stations!"
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Main engines are out, sir."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",We're on emergency power cells.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Casualties, nine dead."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","I think we've found that answer, Doctor."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Before the Valiant was destroyed, its captain was frantically
searching for ESP information on his crew."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Are there not also those who seem to see through solid objects,
cause fires to start spontaneously?"
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Doctor Dehner is speaking of normal ESP power.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","He's reading even faster now than just a few
moments ago."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Is that Gary Mitchell, the one you used to know?"
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Our subject is not Gary Mitchell.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Our concern is, rather, what
he is mutating into."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Have you noted evidence of unusual powers?
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","And on my monitor screen I could see Mitchell smiling each time
it happened, as if this ship and crew were almost a toy for his
amusement."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","In less time than that, he will have attained powers we can't
understand and can't cope with."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Soon we'll be not only useless to him,
but actually an annoyance."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","We'll never reach an Earth base with him aboard, Jim."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","You heard
the mathematics of it."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","In a month he'll have as much in common with us
as we'd have with a ship full of white mice."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Recommendation one.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","There's a planet a few light days away from
here."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Delta Vega.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",It has a lithium cracking station.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","We may be able to
adapt some of its power packs to our engines."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",It is the only possible way to get Mitchell off this ship.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Then you have one other choice.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Kill Mitchell while you still
can."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","It is your only other choice, assuming you make it while you
still have time."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","The captain of the Valiant probably felt the same way, and he
waited too long to make his decision."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",I think we've both guessed that.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",He's regaining consciousness.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Fighting the force field drained his strength, for a while at
least."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",He could be handled now.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",He tried to get through the force field again.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","His eyes changed
back faster."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",He didn't become as weak.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Because she feels.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",I don't.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",All I know is logic.
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","In my opinion
we'll be lucky if we can repair this ship and get away in time."
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",If he should try to stop us
SPOCK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","I felt for him, too."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",We should have intercepted by now.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",The Bridge said they'd call.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Have I ever mentioned you play a very irritating game of chess,
Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Certain you don't know what irritation is?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Terrible having bad blood like that.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","No visual contact, Mister Kelso?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Lock onto it, Mister Kelso."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Bring it aboard.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Old-style ship recorder that could be ejected
when something threatened the ship."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Let's hope its tapes are intact.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","We'll feed it through Mister
Spock's computer."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Flash the Bridge.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Put all decks on the alert.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Getting into shape?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Screen on.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Neutralise warp, Mister Mitchell."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Hold this position.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Address intercraft.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",This is the Captain speaking.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","The object we encountered is a
ship's disaster recorder, apparently ejected from the S.S. Valiant two
hundred years ago."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","We hope to learn from the recorder what the Valiant was doing
here and what destroyed the vessel."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","We'll move out into our probe as
soon as we have those answers."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","All decks, stand by."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",The old impulse engines weren't strong enough.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Extrasensory perception.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Doctor Dehner, how are you on ESP?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",I'm asking what you know about ESP.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Comments?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",That's probably the best argument to continue the probe.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Other
vessels will be heading out here someday and they'll have to know what
they'll be facing."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","We're leaving the galaxy, Mister Mitchell."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Ahead,
warp factor one."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Gravitation on automatic.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",(consoles blow up) Emergency stations.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",All decks on fire alert.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Neutralise controls.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Kelso, put it on manual."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Any radiation?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Anything?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Helmsmen, take us out of here."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","(Dehner gets hit by an electric
charge, then Mitchell) Helmsmen!"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",(Kirk takes controls) Lateral power!
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","(Spock takes over, Enterprise veers away) Take damage reports."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Gary.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Gary, are you all right?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","And you, are you feeling all right?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","You mentioned that tests show you have a high degree of
extrasensory perception."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",So do the records of the others.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Gary Mitchell
has the highest esper rating of all."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Do we know for sure, Doctor, that there isn't another kind?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",I've been worried about you ever since that night on Deneb IV.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Do you feel any different?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",How?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","I wasn't that bad, was I?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",You what?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",You planned that?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",I almost married her!
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",You?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Spinoza?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Go on.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","I'm going to ask Doctor Dehner to keep you under observation for
a while."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Consider it a challenge.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Put a twenty four hour watch on the Sickbay.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Fullest possible
range of examinations and tests."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","That's enough, Doctor."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","It is my duty, whether pleasant or unpleasant, to listen to the
reports, observations, even speculations, on any subject that might
affect the safety of this vessel, and it's my science officer's duty to
see I'm provided with that."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Go ahead, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Mister Scott, would you repeat what you just told us?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Are they right, Doctor?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Has he shown abilities of such magnitude?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",And you didn't think it worth mentioning?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Mister Sulu.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",There'll be no discussion of this with the crew.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Thank you.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",(everyone else leaves)
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","I need a recommendation, Spock, not vague warnings."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",And if we can't?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",We'll be trapped in orbit there.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","We haven't
enough power to blast back out."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","If you mean strand Mitchell there, I won't do it."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","That station is
fully automated."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",There's not a soul on the whole planet.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Even the ore
ships call only once every twenty years."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Get out of here.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Will you try for one moment to feel?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","At least act like you've got
a heart."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",We're talking about Gary.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Set course for Delta Vega.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Are you reading all our thoughts, Gary?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",What would you do in my place?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",I want him unconscious for a while.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",(Dehner sedates him)
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Energise.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Can you do it, Lee?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Take him.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Nobody but us chickens, Doctor."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","The fuel bins, Lee."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Could they be detonated from here?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Do it.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Doctor Piper.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","I want only one medical officer
here at any one time."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","The other will monitor him on the dispensary
screen."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",And almost died.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",I remember.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",You've been testing your ability to take over the Enterprise.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","In
the transporter room, you said something about us
seeming like insects by comparison, squashing us if we got in your way."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Yes.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","In the Sickbay, you said if you were in my place, you'd kill
a mutant like yourself."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Gary.

KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",His eyes went back to normal.

No Man Has Gone Before","Landing
party out."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Doctor Dehner feels he isn't that dangerous.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","What makes you right
and a trained psychiatrist wrong?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","If Mitchell gets out, at your discretion, Lee, if sitting here,
you think you're the last chance, I want you to hit that button."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Have Doctor Piper meet us in the control room with Kelso.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","We'll
all transport up together."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Kelso will be on the destruct button until the last minute.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","I
think he knows that."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","You're leaving with the ship, Doctor."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","I gave you an order, Doctor."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Doctor Dehner?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Don't give him a pill until after I'm gone.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","It's my fault
Mitchell got as far as he did."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Did you see their direction?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","When Mister Spock recovers, you'll both transport up immediately
to the Enterprise."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","If you have not received a signal from me within twelve hours,
you'll proceed at maximum warp to the nearest Earth base
with my recommendation that this entire planet be subjected to a lethal
concentration of neutron radiation."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","No protest on this, Mark."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","That's an
order."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",You must help me Before it goes too far.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",And for humanity?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",You're still human
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","At least partly, you are, or you wouldn't be here talking to me."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",What will Mitchell learn in getting there?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Will he know what to
do with his power?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Will he acquire the wisdom?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Did you hear him joke about compassion?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Above all else, a god
needs compassion."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Mitchell!
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Elizabeth.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Then let's talk about humans, about our frailties."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","As powerful as
he gets, he'll have all that inside him."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",You were a psychiatrist once.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","You know the ugly, savage things we
all keep buried, that none of us dare expose."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",But he'll dare.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Who's to
stop him?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",He doesn't need to care.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Be a psychiatrist for one minute
longer."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",What do you see happening to him?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","What's your prognosis,
Doctor?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Then watch him.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Hang on to being a human for one minute longer.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","A god, but still driven by human frailty."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Do you like what you
see?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",To you?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Not to both of you?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",There'll only be one of you in the end.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",One jealous god.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","if all
this makes a god, or is it making you something else?"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Do you like what you see?
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",Absolute power corrupting absolutely.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","(Dehner zaps Mitchell, he returns fire, she continues and his eyes
return to normal)"
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Gary, forgive me."

in performance of her duty."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell, same
notation."
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",I want his service record to end that way.
KIRK,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","He didn't ask for
what happened to him."

KELSO,"Where

described it."

up."

KELSO,"Where

that, friend Captain."

couple of centuries."

MITCHELL,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before",How do you feel?
MITCHELL,"Where
No Man Has Gone Before","So, er, so, how go the repairs?"
MITCHELL,"Where

have about decayed to lead."

blow the whole impulse deck."

noticed their condition."

SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,All engines stop.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Sound the alert.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Have a look at this, Captain."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Undetermined.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Whatever it is, it's blocking our way."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"When we move, it moves as well."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Negative.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,More some type of device.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Spock here.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Negative.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Whatever it is, it seems to just want to hold us here."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Negative.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"All decks have reported green, Mister Bailey."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,And when the Captain arrives he will expect a full report on
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"It does sound most inconvenient, however."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Have you considered having it removed?
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Spock here.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Negative.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Affirmative.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,No answer from the cube.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Already standing by.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Reporting, sir."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Sensors show it is solid, but its composition is unknown to us."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I believe it adds up to either one of two possibilities.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"First, a space buoy of some kind."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Flypaper.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Negative.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,It would make us appear too weak.

SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Growing.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,We can take only a few more seconds of this.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Nothing, Captain."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"No contacts, no objects in any direction."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Speculate?
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,No.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Logically, we'll discover the intelligence which sent out the cube."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Probably both, and if you're asking the logical decision to make"
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Has it occurred to you that there's a certain inefficiency in constantly questioning me on things you've already made up your mind about?
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Exercise rating, Captain."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Ninety four percent.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Agreed.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"We're picking up an object, sir."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Much larger, coming toward us."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Exceptionally strong contact.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Not visual yet.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Distant spectrograph.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Metallic, similar to cube."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Much greater energy reading.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Tractor beam, Captain."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Something's grabbed us, hard."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Fascinating.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Reading goes off my scale, Captain."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Must be a mile in diameter.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Captain, we're being invaded by exceptionally strong sensor probes everywhere."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Our electrical systems, our engines."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"They're shutting off some of our systems, Captain."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Brilliant.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Extremely sophisticated in their methods.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Enough to warn other Earth ships.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Marker on course.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Heading back the way we (big bang)
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Might be interesting to see what they look like if I can locate where that voice is coming from.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,(McCoy and Scott enter)
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Switching to screen.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I believe I can get something visual.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I was curious to see how they appeared.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Jim.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,They're certainly aware by now that we're totally incapable of it.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"In chess, when one is outmatched, the game is over."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Checkmate.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"I'm s, I regret that I can find no other logical alternative."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"However, it was well played."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I regret not having learned more about this Balok.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,In some manner he was reminiscent of my father.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Quite the contrary.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,She considered herself a very fortunate Earth woman.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"A very interesting game, this poker."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"I have visual contact, Captain."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,About two thousand metric tons.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Engine systems coming on, Captain."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Tractor beam again.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,He's sneaked power down a bit.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,We're superheating.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Intermix temperature, seven thousand four hundred degrees."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Seven five, seven six, eight thousand degrees."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"(everything is juddering, the little ship is getting brighter and brighter)"
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Two thousand degrees above maximum.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Eight four, eight five, eight six."
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,She'll blow soon!
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,That may not be wise.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,He got a signal through to the mother ship.
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"For it, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Captain, request permission to"
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Three days of this now, sir."

BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,I'll have it by then.
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Raising my voice back there doesn't mean I was scared or couldn't do my job.
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,It means I happen to have a human thing called an adrenaline gland.
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Very funny.
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Distance from us, fifteen hundred ninety three metres, position constant."
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Sir, we going to just let it hold us here?"

BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,A message coming over my navigation beam.
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Recorder marker dispatched, sir."
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,What?
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,A course?
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,I don't understand this.
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Spock's wasting time.
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Everybody else just sitting around.
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Somebody's got to do something.
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,What do they want from us?
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Let's find out what they want us to do.
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,We've only got eight minutes left.
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,He's doing a countdown!
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"What, are you all out of your minds?"
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,End of watch?
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,It's the end of everything.
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"What are you, robots?"
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Wound-up toy soldiers?
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Don't you know when you're dying?
BAILEY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Watch and regulations and orders What do they mean?

SULU,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Something's going on, Captain."
SULU,The Corbomite Maneuver,(something leaves the Fesarius)
SULU,The Corbomite Maneuver,"We're being towed, sir."
SULU,The Corbomite Maneuver,Our speed is down to point six four of light.
SULU,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Yes, sir."
SULU,The Corbomite Maneuver,"It's a strain, Captain."

UHURA,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Hailing frequencies, sir."
UHURA,The Corbomite Maneuver,"A signal, Captain."
UHURA,The Corbomite Maneuver,It's very weak.
UHURA,The Corbomite Maneuver,It's Balok.
UHURA,The Corbomite Maneuver,It's a distress signal to the Fesarius.
UHURA,The Corbomite Maneuver,His engines are out.
UHURA,The Corbomite Maneuver,His life-sustaining system isn't operating.
UHURA,The Corbomite Maneuver,"The message is repeating, sir."
UHURA,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Negative, sir."
UHURA,The Corbomite Maneuver,The signal is growing weak.
UHURA,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Sir, I doubt if the mother ship could have heard it."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Just a few seconds more.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,That's a boy.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Keep it up.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Work up a little sweat, it'll will do you good."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,(notices red alert)
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Stop.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Winded?
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Finally finished a physical on you, didn't I."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"(Kirk leaves) What am I, a doctor or a moon shuttle conductor?"
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"If I jumped every time a light came on around here, I'd end up talking to myself."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Same report.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Your timing is lousy, Jim."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Your men are tired.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,I never say that.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,I'm especially worried about Bailey.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Navigator's position's rough enough for a seasoned man.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Oh?
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,How so sure?
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Because you spotted something you liked in him, something familiar, like yourself say about, oh, eleven years ago?"
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,I don't need textbooks to know you could've promoted him too fast.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Listen to that voice.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Well, they're not."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,After what they've been through they really should
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"No, I never say that, either."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"What are you going to do with that six percent when they give it to you, Jim?"
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Your weight was up a couple of pounds, remember?"
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"No, no."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"No, I never eat until the crew eats."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"What's the matter, Jim."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Don't you trust yourself?
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Balok's message.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,It was heard all over the ship.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Easy, Bailey."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Practically end of watch.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Let's go.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,(McCoy and Bailey leave)
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Assuming we get out of this, Captain"
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Well, then about Bailey."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Let me enter it in my medical records as simple fatigue.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,And your mistake.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"You overworked him, pushed him, expected too much from him."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,I intend to challenge your actions in my records.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,I'll state that I warned you about Bailey's condition.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Now that's no bluff.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,For having other things on your mind?
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,My fault.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,I don't how the devil you keep from punching me in the face.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,Love to teach it to you.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,I thought the power was off in the galley.
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Jim, don't you think"
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,"No, but you won't let that stop you."
MCCOY,The Corbomite Maneuver,And your crew?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"(on back, pumping pedals) Just a few seconds more."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,You're killing me.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,You're killing me.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,You'd be the last one I'd tell.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"(sees light, goes to desk monitor) Kirk here."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,What's going on?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,What's that?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,A vessel of some kind?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I'll be right up.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"You could see the alarm lights flashing from there, McCoy."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Why didn't you tell me?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Bridge.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Captain to Bridge.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Any changes?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Any indication of danger from it?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I'll change first then.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Captain out.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Captain to Bridge.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Any signs of life?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Have you tried all hailing frequencies?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Have the department heads meet me on the Bridge.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Lieutenant Uhura.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Navigation.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Scotty.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I'll buy speculation.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Life sciences.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"I'll keep that in mind, Mister Bailey, when this becomes a democracy."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Anything further, gentlemen?"
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Second?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,And you don't recommend sticking around.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"It's time for action, gentlemen."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Mister Bailey
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Countermand.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I'll select what kind of action.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Are you explaining Mister Bailey?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I haven't requested an explanation.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Now, as I was about to say, Navigator, plot us a spiral course away from the cube."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Engage, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Quarter speed.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Let's see if it'll give way.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Ahead half speed.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,All stop.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Hold position.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Power astern, half speed."

KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Helm, give us warp speed."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Phaser Crew stand ready.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Lock phasers on target.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Mister Bailey, lock phasers."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Fire main phasers.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Care to speculate on what we'll find if we go on ahead?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Intelligence different from ours or superior?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"No, I'm not."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,The mission of the Enterprise is to seek out and contact alien life.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,It gives me emotional security.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Navigator, set a course ahead."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Engage.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Mister Bailey, phaser crews were sluggish."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,You were slow in locking them into your directional beam.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Helmsman, engineering decks could have been faster, too."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Programme a series of simulated attacks and evasion maneuvers.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Keep repeating the exercise until we're proficient, gentlemen."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Captain's quarters.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Aren't you the one who always says a little suffering is good for the soul?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I think he'll cut it.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Why, Doctor, you've been reading your textbooks again?"
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,What's next?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"They're not machines, Jim?"
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Doctor McCoy, I've heard you say that man is ultimately superior to any mechanical device."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I could've sworn I heard you say that.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Let's try for one hundred, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"I'm going to take it, and I'm going to (door opens)"
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,What the devil is this?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Green leaves?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Will you stop hovering over me, Yeoman?"
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Bring some for the doctor, too."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Thank you, Yeoman."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,When I find the headquarters genius that assigned me a female yeoman
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I've already got a female to worry about.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Her name's the Enterprise.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Coming.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Half speed.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Prepare for evasive action.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,All engines stop.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Phaser crews stand ready.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"What's its mass, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Reduce image.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Let me see all of it.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Ship to ship.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,This is the United Earth ship Enterprise.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,We convey greetings and await your reply.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"What is it, Mister Bailey?"
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Pick it up.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Ship to ship.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,The warning nature of your space buoy was unknown to us.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Our vessel was blocked.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,When we attempted to disengage
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Does the recorder marker have this on its tapes?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Mister Bailey, dispatch recorder marker."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Mister Bailey?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Captain to crew.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Those of you who have served for long on this vessel have encountered alien lifeforms.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"You know the greatest danger facing us is ourselves, an irrational fear of the unknown."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"But there's no such thing as the unknown, only things temporarily hidden, temporarily not understood."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,In most cases we have found that intelligence capable of a civilisation is capable of understanding peaceful gestures.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Surely a lifeform advanced enough for space travel is advanced enough to eventually understand our motives.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,All decks stand by.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Captain out.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Ship to ship.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,This is the Captain of the USS Enterprise.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,We came seeking friendship but we have no wish to trespass.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"To demonstrate our goodwill, our vessel will now return the way it came."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"We (humming noise) Lay in a course ahead, Mister Bailey."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Engage, warp factor one."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Switch to impulse.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Yes, of course you were."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,They want us to lose our heads.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Bailey, you're relieved!"
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Escort him to his quarters, Doctor."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Ship to ship.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,It is the custom of Earth people to try and avoid misunderstanding whenever possible.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,We destroyed your space buoy as a simple act of self-preservation.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"When we attempted to move away from it, it emitted radiation harmful to our species."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"If you've examined our ship and its tapes, you know this to be true."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,(humming noise)
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,What's the matter with them out there?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,They must know we mean them no harm.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"There must be something to do, something I've overlooked."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Is that your best recommendation?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Nobody's given up yet.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"That's my decision, Doctor."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I'm ordering you to drop it.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"I have no time for you, your theories, your quaint philosophies."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Any time you can bluff me, Doctor."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"All right, Doctor."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Let's hope we have time to argue about it.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Not chess, Mister Spock, poker."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Do you know the game?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Ship to ship.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,This is the Captain of the Enterprise.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Our respect for other lifeforms requires that we give you this warning.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,One critical item of information that has never been incorporated into the memory banks of any Earth ship.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Since the early years of space exploration, Earth vessels have had incorporated into them a substance known as corbomite."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,It is a material and a device which prevents attack on us.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"If any destructive energy touches our vessel, a reverse reaction of equal strength is created, destroying"
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Destroying the attacker!
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"It may interest you to know that since the initial use of corbomite more than two of our centuries ago, no attacking vessel has survived the attempt."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Death has little meaning to us.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,If it has none to you then attack us now.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,We grow annoyed at your foolishness.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Doc.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Sorry.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Permission granted.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,It does have advantages over chess.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Here it comes.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Is it raise or call?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Hold on that.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Let him sweat for a change.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Ship to ship.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Request denied.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,It's a small ship.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I want a right angled course.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Shear away from him no matter which way he turns.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Maximum acceleration when I give the word.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Engage.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,More power.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Shear away, Mister Bailey."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Now, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Impulse power two.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,All engines stop.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Then we're not home yet.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Any reply?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Plot a course for it, Mister Bailey."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Dead ahead.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,This is the Captain speaking.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,First Federation vessel is in distress.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,We're preparing to board it.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,There are lives at stake.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"By our standards, alien life but lives nevertheless."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Captain out.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Mister Scott, ready the transporter room."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Mister Sulu, bring us to within one hundred metres."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Ahead slow.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"What's the mission of this vessel, Doctor?"
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"To seek out and contact alien life, and an opportunity to demonstrate what our high-sounding words mean."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Any questions?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I'll take two men with me.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Doctor McCoy to examine and treat the aliens if necessary, and you, Mister Bailey."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,The face of the unknown.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I think I owe you a look at it.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Denied.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"If I'm wrong, if it's a trap, I want you here."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Transporter ready?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Air sample?
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Thank you, Scotty."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Ready, Doctor?"
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Energise.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,It's a dummy.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,A puppet of some kind.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I'm Captain Kirk.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Commander Balok.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Commander, that puppet."
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I see.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,But you probed our memory banks.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Yes.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Both our cultures would benefit.
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Do you know where we can find a volunteer, Mister Bailey?"
KIRK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"But you'd find out more about us that way, and I'd get a better officer in return."
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,Motive power?
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,Beats me what makes it go.
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,I'd sell it if I had any.
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,That's a solid cube.
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,"How something like that can sense us coming, block us, move when we move, well it beats me."
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,That's my report.
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,"You have an annoying fascination for timepieces, Mister Sulu."
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,Then may heaven have helped your mother.
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Engines need work badly, Captain."
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,Can you hold it here a few hours?
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,(leaves)
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Well, yes, sir, but it's risky."
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,We're locked on what appears to be a main deck.
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,Breathable.
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,"In fact, a slightly higher oxygen content than our own."
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Communicator, phaser weapon."
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Bend low, gentlemen."
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,It reads pretty cramped over there.
SCOTT,The Corbomite Maneuver,Ready to transport.
RAND,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Excuse me, sir."
RAND,The Corbomite Maneuver,"It's past time you had something to eat, sir."
RAND,The Corbomite Maneuver,"It's dietary salad, sir."
RAND,The Corbomite Maneuver,Doctor McCoy ordered your diet card changed.
RAND,The Corbomite Maneuver,I thought you knew.
RAND,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Well, I'll change it if you don't like it, sir."
RAND,The Corbomite Maneuver,"You're welcome, sir."
RAND,The Corbomite Maneuver,(leaves)
RAND,The Corbomite Maneuver,"I used a hand phaser, and zap."
RAND,The Corbomite Maneuver,Hot coffee.
CREWMAN,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Forward phaser, will comply."
CREWMAN,The Corbomite Maneuver,All weapons at operational ready.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,And trespassed into our star systems.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"This is Balok, Commander of the flagship Fesarius of the First Federation."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Your vessel, obviously the product of a primitive and savage civilisation, having ignored a warning buoy and having then destroyed it, has demonstrated your intention is not peaceful."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,We are now considering the disposition of your ship and the life aboard.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,No further communication will be accepted.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"If there is the slightest hostile move, your vessel will be destroyed immediately."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Your recorder marker has been destroyed.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,You have been examined.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Your ship must be destroyed.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,We make assumption you have a deity or deities or some such beliefs which comfort you.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,We therefore grant you ten Earth time periods known as minutes to make preparations.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,You are wasting time and effort.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,There is no escape.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,You have eight Earth minutes left.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,You now have seven minutes left.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Four minutes.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Three minutes.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,You now have two minutes.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,This is the Commander of the Fesarius.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,The destruction of your vessel has been delayed.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,We will relent in your destruction only if we have proof of your corbomite device.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,We will soon inform you of our decision regarding your vessel.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"And having permitted your primitive efforts to see my form, I trust it has pleased your curiosity."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"And now, another demonstration of our superiority."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,It has been decided that I will conduct you to a planet of the First Federation which is capable of sustaining your lifeform.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,There you will disembark and be interned.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Your ship will be destroyed, of course."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Do not be deceived by the size of this pilot vessel.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,It has an equal potential to destroy your vessel.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"So that you may sustain your gravity and atmosphere, your systems are now open."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Escape is impossible since you are being taken under our power to your destination.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Any move to escape or destroy this ship will result in the instant destruction of the Enterprise and everyone aboard.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I'm Balok.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Welcome aboard.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,(curtain opens to reveal a small humanoid with big grin)
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,And McCoy and Bailey.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Sit.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Be comfortable.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Go ahead, be seated."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,We must drink.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,This is tranya.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I hope you relish it as much as I.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"I know, I know, a thousand questions."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"But first, the tranya."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Gentlemen.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,(drinks) Ahh.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"My alter ego, so to speak."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"In your culture, he would be Mister Hyde to my Jekyll."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,You must admit he's effective.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,You would never have been frightened by me.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,And I thought my distress signal quite clever.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,It was a pleasure testing you.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,I had to discover your real intentions.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Your records could have been a deception on your part.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"I have no crew, Doctor."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"I run everything, this entire complex, from this small ship."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"But I miss company, conversation."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Even an alien would be welcome.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Perhaps one of your men for some period of time.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"An exchange of information, cultures."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Ah.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"You represent Earth's best, then."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,(laughs) I see.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"We think much alike, Captain, you and I."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Now, before I bring back the Fesarius, let me show you my vessel."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,It is not often I have this pleasure.
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,"Yes, we're very much alike, Captain."
BALOK,The Corbomite Maneuver,Both proud of our ships.
SULU,"Mudd's
Women","There he is, sir."
SULU,"Mudd's
Women",Centre screen.
SULU,"Mudd's

to run away from us, sir."
SULU,"Mudd's
Women","No, sir."
SULU,"Mudd's

SULU,"Mudd's
Women",He knows we're after him all right.
SULU,"Mudd's
Women","He's seen the asteroids too, sir."
SULU,"Mudd's
Women",If one hits him.
SULU,"Mudd's
Women","He's drifting into the asteroid belt, Captain."
SULU,"Mudd's
Women","We're overloading, Captain."
SULU,"Mudd's
Women",Engine temperatures climbing.
SULU,"Mudd's
Women","That was one of our lithium crystal circuits, sir."
SULU,"Mudd's
Women",Another lithium circuit.
SULU,"Mudd's
Women","Now supplementing
with battery power, sir."
SULU,"Mudd's
Women",Asteroid hit him dead centre.
SULU,"Mudd's
Women","You're on duty, Johnny-o."
SULU,"Mudd's
Women",Back to reality.
SULU,"Mudd's
Women",I noticed.
SULU,"Mudd's
Women",How I noticed.
SULU,"Mudd's
Women","Come on, Johnny."
SULU,"Mudd's
Women","Captain Kirk, engineering section reports our entire life-support
system is now on batteries."
SULU,"Mudd's
Women","Power curve still dropping, Captain."
SULU,"Mudd's
Women","Checking, but not getting much."
SULU,"Mudd's
Women",That's Ben Childress' quarters.
SULU,"Mudd's
Women",Engines engaged.
SULU,"Mudd's
Women",Helm answering.
SULU,"Mudd's
Women","Ahead full, sir."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Don't lose him, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Earth ship, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Stay with him, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Communication?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",He's receiving us alright.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Deflectors on, Mister Farrell."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Stay with him.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",He'll try to lose us in them.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Try to warn him.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",If he loses power now
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Cover him with our deflector screen, Mister Farrell."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Scotty,
Spock, stand by in the transporter room."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Bridge to transporter room.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","If you don't start beaming that crew
over soon"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Scotty, we're getting a distress signal."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Scotty, how many of them did you get aboard?"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Bridge to transporter room.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Their vessel
has been hit by an asteroid."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",It's gone.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Did you get the crew off?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Kirk to transporter room.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Report.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Bridge to transporter room.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Deflector screen down, Mister Farrell."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Save the power.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Captain to transporter room.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Are you
reading me or not, Mister Scott?"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Bridge to transporter room.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","How many
did we get off?"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","If that captain can walk, I want him in my cabin
immediately."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Correction,"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",I want him there whether he can walk or not.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Kirk out.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Come.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Good.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Now, if you don't mind telling"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",And the ladies?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Is this your crew, Captain?"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Your name, please."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Mister Walsh, I'm convening a ship's hearing on your actions."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Mister Spock will supply you with any legal information
you may need for your defence."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","And you're a liar, Mister Walsh."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","I think we both understand each
other."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Security!
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Escort Mister Walsh to his quarters.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Confine him
there."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Well, switch to by-pass circuits."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","If it makes you feel better, Engineer, that's one jackass we're
going to see skinned."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Well, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Location and distance.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Make for Rigel 12, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",This hearing is convened.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Stardate 1329.2, on
board starship U.S.S."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Enterprise.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Formal hearings against transport
captain Leo Walsh."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Start computer.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Mister Mudd, you're charged with galaxy travel without a flight
plan, without an identification beam, and failure to answer a
starship's signal, thus effecting a menace to navigation."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","You're also charged with operation of a vessel without a master's
license."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Destination and purpose of journey?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Come again, Mister Mudd."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",You do what?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Data on witnesses.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Computer, go to sensor probe."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Any unusual readings?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Er, that's sufficient."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Strike that from the record.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Did these ladies come voluntarily?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",The only charges are against Mister Mudd.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Illegal operation of a
vessel."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Do you have any defence to offer?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",The hearing is closed.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Mister Mudd to be handed over to the legal
authorities at our earliest opportunity."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Miss McHuron, if you don't mind"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Miss McHuron, would you mind."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Mister Spock, will
you contact the miners on Rigel 12?"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Notify them that we'll need the
lithium crystals immediately upon arrival."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",(all officers leave)
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","As a matter of fact, Miss McHuron, I do."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Yes.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",I'll have to talk to them about that.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","They, er, they don't
do that ordinarily, Miss McHuron, but somehow, in your case, and the
ladies with you, its, er"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Yes.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Yes, er, now, Miss McHuron"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Well, it probably appears more difficult than it is."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Neither have I.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Miss McHuron, I don't"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","I asked for a preorbital course, Mister
Farrell."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","That's the last time I'm giving an order twice, gentlemen."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","We're
down to battery power, and we're low on that."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Just hang us in long enough to get six crystals, Scotty."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","That's
all we need."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Ridiculous.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",What are we running here.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Did you examine them?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Did
you examine Eve?"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Well, come on, you're the doctor."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",What is it?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Is it that we're
tired, and they're beautiful?"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",They are incredibly beautiful.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",What are they?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",I asked you first.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",I don't follow you.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Lay in.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Computer?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",More than enough time.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Communications, have a representative of
the Rigel 12 miners meet us here to discuss our needs."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Beam him up
first pass over their camp."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Not at all, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","The choice was burning this lithium
crystal or the destruction of another man's ship."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Come.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Good.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Show them in.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","I'm James Kirk, captain of the Enterprise."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",This is my science officer Mister Spock.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Fine.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",I'm authorised to pay an equitable price.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",What did you have in mind?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",(laughs) Is there anything else?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",No deal.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","You're a long way out in space, gentlemen."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","You'll need
medical help, cargo runs, starship protection."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","You want to consider
those facts too?"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",It's still no deal.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","All right, Childress, you've won."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Now I'll
take the lithium crystals."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Childress.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",You got a better idea?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Just have those crystals here when I get back.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Eve!
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Eve!
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",But we don't!
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",I didn't get any.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",I should have found a way.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Satisfied, Mister Scott?"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Has Childress reported in yet?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Sorry, Scotty."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",How much power do we have left?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Have Mudd meet me in the transporter room.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",The name of this game.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Sit down.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Tell him.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Tell him, Harry."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","The Venus drugs, Harry."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Oh, it exists, illegally."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",He gave it to the women before you met them.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","They've left for their quarters during the storm, Childress."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",They're married.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Subspace radio marriage.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",It was a fraud.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","They can get
out of it."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Quite a woman, eh, Childress?"
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",By herself.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",She took no drug.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Coloured gelatin.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",There's only one kind of woman.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","You either believe in yourself, or you don't."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","All right
Childress, I've gone as far with you as I intend to."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","I want those
lithium crystals and I want them now."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Enterprise, this is Kirk."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Stand by.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Do I beam down a search party?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Stand by, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","We're coming aboard with the lithium
crystals."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Eve?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Two of us, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","Come on, Mister Mudd."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women","I can't do that, Harry, but I will appear as a character witness
at your trial."
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",If you think that'll help.
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Why should I work your side of the street?
KIRK,"Mudd's
Women",Ahead full.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","Difficult to say, Captain."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","We're getting no registration beam
from it."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","Sir, he's pushing his engines too hard."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","Approaching an asteroid belt, Captain."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","Schiller rating three
five."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",Sensor reading on the vessel.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","I make it out as a small class J
cargo ship, and his engines are super-heating."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",How many more in your crew?
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",What's wrong?
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",It'll take longer on battery power.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",Curious.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","You're certain this was everyone aboard, Mister Walsh?"
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",No other crewmen?
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",You can explain that to the Captain.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",(the group leave)
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",Deck twelve.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","The Commander of the transport to see you, Captain."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",Better rig a by-pass circuit.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","Needed on the bridge, Captain."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","The entire ship's power is feeding through
one lithium crystal."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","And that crystal won't hold up, not pulling all our power
through it."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",There's a lithium mining operation on Rigel 12.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","High-grade ore,
I've heard."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",Mister Farrell has the course.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",Less than two day's travel.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","Rigel 12, Mister Farrell."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",You have the course.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",State your name for the record.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",Your correct name.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",State your correct name for the record.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","Any past offenses, Mister Mudd?"
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","We can sustain this orbit for three days, seven hours."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","Even burned and cracked, they're beautiful."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",Destroying them was a shame.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","Conserving batteries, sir."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",Half power.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","We don't have the time to spare, Captain."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","The storm is ionising the atmosphere, Captain."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","Getting difficult
to probe through it."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",Infrared reading.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","Check traverse three, grid
zero four zero."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",There's a heat unit operating in there.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",It could be a cookstove.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",Mudd?
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","How many coming, Captain?"
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",I'm happy the affair is over.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women",A most annoying emotional episode.
SPOCK,"Mudd's
Women","The fact that my internal arrangement differs from yours,
Doctor, pleases me no end."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","If it is, he'll soon overload his engines."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","Captain, if we try, we'll overload our own engines."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","He's too far
away."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women",(they leave)
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women",They're not answering our signal.
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","There's nothing to lock
onto."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","We're locked onto something, Captain."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","Your vessel's breaking up, man."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","If we don't get them over here
right now"
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","Only one, sir, but we've locked onto three more."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","I don't know, sir."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women",With those three lithium crystals gone
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","Not yet, sir, but we've hooked onto something."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","(three women beam
in, the men are transfixed)"
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","Oh, er, four in all, sir."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","We've got trouble, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","One lithium crystal left, and that with a hairline split at the
base."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women",Can't.
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women",We blew the whole converter assembly.
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women",We burned them all out when we super-heated.
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","That jackass Walsh
not only wrecked his vessel, but in saving his skin"
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women",But it's frustrating.
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","Almost a million gross tons of vessel
depending on a hunk of crystal the size of my fist."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","Our last crystal, sir."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women",It's gone.
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","It'll get us to Rigel 12, sir, but it'll be a shaky orbit."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women",I'll get you there.
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","Captain, this is draining our batteries further."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","If we only had
those crystals."
SCOTT,"Mudd's
Women","About five hours, sir."
UHURA,"Mudd's
Women","I've tried all frequencies, sir."
UHURA,"Mudd's
Women",He refuses to answer.
UHURA,"Mudd's
Women","Unless
he's not receiving us."
UHURA,"Mudd's
Women","I'm getting a distress signal call from them, sir."
UHURA,"Mudd's
Women","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"Mudd's
Women","Losing communications with the miners, sir."
UHURA,"Mudd's
Women","Magnetic storm seems
worse."
UHURA,"Mudd's
Women","No, sir."
UHURA,"Mudd's
Women",He and the girl are still missing.
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women","There go his engines, sir."
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women","He's had it, unless we put our deflector screen around him."
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women","We're protecting him, sir."
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women",We won't be able to hold it long.
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women",There she goes.
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women","We're clearing the asteroid belt now, Captain."
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women","You can feel their eyes when they look at you, like something
grabbing hold of you."
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women",Did you notice that?
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women","Preorbital course locked in, sir."
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women","We'll make orbit, sir."
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women",A temporary one.
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women",Traverse parallel three and four.
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women","About eleven miles, bearing one two one from the mining
company."
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women",Course plotted and all systems in operation.
FARRELL,"Mudd's
Women","Out of orbit, sir."
CREWMAN,"Mudd's
Women",This is the Engine room.
CREWMAN,"Mudd's
Women","Temperatures are passing the
danger line."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Meaning no ingratitude, gentlemen, but just where is it I find
meself?"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","It's really a darn beautiful ship, isn't it?"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Really a beautiful
ship."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Oh, the name, gentlemen, is Walsh, Captain Leo Walsh."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Just a few more.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","We couldn't be sure you was a friendly vessel, now could we."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Ah,
but the three will be in position about by now."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","It's all right, darlings."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",We're in good hands.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","That fellow sounded a mite upset, didn't he?"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Oh, no, that's everyone, all right, but so far as the ladies
actually being the crew"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Ah, sure, these starships are really
something marvellous, but men will always be men no matter where they
are."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Eh, mister?"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",You'll never take that out of them.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","You're part Vulcanian, aren't you."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Ah well then, a pretty face
doesn't affect you at all, does it."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","That is, unless you want it to."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","You
can save it, girls."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",This type can turn himself off from any emotion.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","I'll handle the conversation, darling."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well, no, Captain."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",This is me cargo.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well, how the devil am I supposed to know
this is a starship, Captain?"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Here I am with a cargo of young lovelies.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",A strange ship comes up alongside.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Well.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","naturally I did my best to
evade you."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","And starship Captain or no, you exceeded your authority when
you drove me and mine into a shower of asteroids."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Walsh.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Leo Walsh.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","You destroyed me ship, Captain."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","You're a hard-nosed one, Captain."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Shh!
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Calm down now, darlings."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Would you mind waiting outside?
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well, now, answer every question they put to you."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Don't lie.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well, you've no need to, have you, and don't submit to a med."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","That is,
being so healthy, they've no need for a medical exam, have they."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",They won't.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Have you no place to go lads?
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","No, no, no, they won't."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Just let Leo take all the hard questions.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Now don't be panicking, loves."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",We'll get to
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Leo Francis Walsh.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Gentlemen, surely you're not going to take the word of a soulless
mechanical device over that of a real flesh and blood man."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Harry Mudd.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Harcourt Fenton Mudd.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Of course not.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Gentlemen, I'm simply an honest businessman."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Blast that tin-plated pot.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","It can't, darling."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",It can't.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Just what's on the record.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",What?
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",My tiny ship in this immense galaxy a menace to navigation?
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Untrue!
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",I have a master's ticket.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",All right.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well, very simply, Leo Walsh, who was to be my captain
on this trip, passed away suddenly."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well, I had no choice but to take
out me ship me own self."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",I assumed Leo's name out of courtesy to him.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","In memoriam, as it were."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","A fine, fine man, alas, gone to his reward."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Planet Ophiuchus 3.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Wiving settlers.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","I recruit wives for settlers, a difficult but satisfying task."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","You see, gentlemen, just as I told you."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Three lovely ladies
destined for frontier planets to be the companions of lonely men, to
supply that warmth of a human touch that's so desperately needed."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","A
wife, a home, a family."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Gentlemen, I look upon this work as a sacred
public trust."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",I've devoted me whole life to it.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well, I'm about to start devoting my entire life to it."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well, of course!"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Now, for example, Ruthie here comes from a
pelagic planet, sea ranchers."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Magda there from the helium experimental
station."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Fine, Evie."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Fine.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","That's enough, Evie."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Only heaven's own truth, which I've just given you."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Oh, you beautiful galaxy!"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Oh, that heavenly universe!"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well,
girls, lithium miners."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Don't you understand?
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Lonely, isolated,
overworked, rich lithium miners!"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Girls, do you still want husbands,
hmm?"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Evie, you won't be satisfied with a mere ship's captain."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","I'll get
you a man who can buy you a whole planet."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Maggie, you're going to be a
countess."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Ruth, I'll make you a duchess."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","And I, I'll be running this
starship."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Captain James Kirk, the next orders you're taking will be
given by Harcourt Fenton Mudd!"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Just three?
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",You're sure?
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Later, dear, later."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Magda, did you get to your communications
man?"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",And they've been there?
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Perfect.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Perfect.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Three of them and three lovely ladies has Harry
Mudd."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","And lithium crystals, my dear, are worth three hundred times
their weight in diamonds, thousands of times their weight in gold."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","No, my dears."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","After one more job for you, it won't be Harry Mudd
that's trapped."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",It will be a gentleman named James T
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well, I'm not really surprised."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","I've seen you noticing the
Captain."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Rigel 12.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Rigel 12.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well, this isn't exactly the Enterprise."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",My name is Harry Mudd.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","To whom have I the pleasure of speaking, sir?"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","(ransacking drawers frantically) For whom, Evie?"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",For Kirk?
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","You'll
find out that Ship's captains are already married, girl, to their
vessels."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","You'd find out the first time you came between him and the
ship."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",You'll see.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","I didn't hide them, girl."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","I put them in a safe place in case I
was searched."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Mattress!
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Yes, here!"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","(Ruth and Magda devour them eagerly) Go on,
Eve."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Take it.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",It's not a cheat.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","It's a miracle for some man who can
appreciate it and who needs it."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Come along, ladies, come along."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",You must be Ben Childress.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Come
on now, girls, come on."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","I'm told they have only three days of orbit left before they
start spiraling in."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","I do hate to see you suffering such a situation,
Captain, but truth is truth, and the sad fact is you will deal."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Sooner
or later, you'll have to."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Thank heaven you found her.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",Ah.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Yes, well."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well, actually, you see, it's a relatively harmless drug."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well, what it does is give you more of whatever you have."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Well,
with men, it makes them more muscular."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Women, rounder."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Men, more
aggressive."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Women, more feminine, and"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Mister Childress, I"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",If they want to.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",You can't condemn the women.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Yes, they took away my drug and substituted that."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Or man, for that matter."
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women","Don't you think you could possibly, by accident, arrange to leave
me behind here?"
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",On this planet that would be punishment enough.
MUDD,"Mudd's
Women",They'll throw away the key.
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",You're aboard the U.S.S.
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",Enterprise.
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",Never trusted this.
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",Yes.
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Yes, they are."
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Amen to that, Scotty."
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Why, yes, please do."
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",By all means.
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Connors, are you finished?"
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Would, Would you walk past my panel again, please?"
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",My medical scanner.
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",Oh no.
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","I wouldn't trust my, my judgment, believe me."
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Just walk
by, please."
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","(scanner heart monitor activates) It's not supposed to do
that."
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Yes, if they need it."
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",What?
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Oh, yes, they're in excellent health, all three of them."
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Are you wearing some unusual kind of perfume or something
radioactive, my dear?"
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",I wonder what makes it do that.
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",She refused.
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Are they, Jim?"
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Are they actually more lovely, pound for pound,
measurement for measurement, than any other women you've known?"
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Or is
it that they just, well, act beautiful."
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",No.
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Strike that, strike that."
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",You mean are they alien illusions?
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",That sort of thing?
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","No, an alien smart enough to pull this could also keep my
medical scanner from going beep!"
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",I don't either.
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","That must have been quite a talk you made
down there."
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",Ever try considering the patent medicine business?
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women",Smack right in the old heart.
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","Oh, I'm sorry."
MCCOY,"Mudd's
Women","In your case, it
would be about here."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","I apologise for what he said, sir."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","He's used to buying and selling
people."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",Hello.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",Get where?
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","We don't have a ship and we're headed the wrong way,
Harry."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","It's the same story for all of us, Captain."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",No men.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","Mine was a
farm planet with automated machines for company and two brothers to
cook for, mend their clothes, canal mud a foot thick on their boots
every time they walked in."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",It's not fine!
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","We've got men willing to be our husbands waiting
for us, and you're taking us in the opposite direction!"
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",Staring at us Iike we were Saturnius harem girls or something.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",And what about us?
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",What happens to us?
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","Help us, please."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",All of us.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",Captain?
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",I hope you don't mind.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","I was trying to take a walk, and I just, I just had to run in
someplace."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","You see, all your men were looking at me, following me with
their eyes."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",They're probably just lonely.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",I can understand loneliness.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","I, I suppose you understand it even more, having to run a huge
ship like this with so much responsibility every minute
and having to be so careful with all your men looking up to you."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",Hmm!
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","I read once that a commander has to act like a paragon of
virtue."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",I never met a paragon.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","Well, of course not."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",No one is.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",But some people try to pretend.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","Do
you, Captain?"
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","Oh, no!"
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","Oh, I just can't do it."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",I don't care what Harry Mudd says.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","I do like you, but I just can't go through with it."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","I hate this whole
thing!"
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","I don't like you, and I'm not very happy with myself, either."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",We're supposed to notice them!
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","Oh, oh Harry, I don't feel very
good."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",I think it must be near the time.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","You'll never find them, Harry, and if you do find them you know
what they are."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",A cheat.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","If you care for someone, really care"
EVE,"Mudd's

EVE,"Mudd's

and it's still the same song."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",There.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",You going to eat or talk?
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",Well you're tasting some of it now.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","I couldn't scrape three layers
of your leavings out of that pan."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","Well, why don't you hang your pan out in the wind and let the sand
blast it clean, or hadn't you thought about that?"
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",Double jack.
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",Not in double jack.
EVE,"Mudd's

EVE,"Mudd's

EVE,"Mudd's
Women","This is what you want, Mister
Childress."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","I hope you remember it and dream about it, because you can't
have it."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women",It's not real!
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","(takes the pills) Is this the kind of wife you
want, Ben?"
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","Not someone to help you, not a wife to cook and sew and cry
and need, but this kind."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","Selfish, vain, useless."
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","Is this what you
really want?"
EVE,"Mudd's
Women","All right, then."
EVE,"Mudd's

EVE,"Mudd's

RUTH,"Mudd's
Women",It's fascinating.
RUTH,"Mudd's
Women",Your what?
RUTH,"Mudd's
Women","Oh, why?"
RUTH,"Mudd's
Women","You're not giving me an examination, are you?"
RUTH,"Mudd's
Women","I wondered, will you be examining the miners on Rigel 12?"
RUTH,"Mudd's
Women",You haven't asked yet?
RUTH,"Mudd's

RUTH,"Mudd's

RUTH,"Mudd's

hundred miles above them."
RUTH,"Mudd's
Women",Look what's happening.
RUTH,"Mudd's
Women","(hair lank, skin
slightly lined) Look at my face."
RUTH,"Mudd's
Women",What if someone sees us like this?
RUTH,"Mudd's
Women",I'm going back to what I was.
RUTH,"Mudd's
Women",Ugly.
RUTH,"Mudd's
Women","Why did you hide them, Harry?"
RUTH,"Mudd's
Women",Don't you trust us?
RUTH,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

we've got them."
CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

dozen feet from your doorstep."
CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

CHILDRESS,"Mudd's

KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,That should make a good specimen.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Yeah.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,At night it gets down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,What happened?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Let's see it.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Get back to the ship.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Report to the Sickbay.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Captain Kirk ready to beam up.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, I'm all right."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Just a little dizzy.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I can't get through there.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Nothing serious.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Don't leave the transporter room unattended.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Thank you.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"All right, Engineer, I'll have my engines looked to."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Thank you, Yeoman."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,That's all.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Saurian brandy.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"(grabbing him by the neck) I said, give me the brandy!"
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,(leaves with bottle and goes to Rand's quarters)
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Yeah.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Come in.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?"
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Like what?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,That's nice.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Come on, Spock, I know that look."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,What is it?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Our good doctor's been putting you on again.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'll tell him you were properly annoyed.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"What is it, Scotty?"
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Yes?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Oh, my."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Jim will do here, Janice."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,You're too beautiful to ignore.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Too much woman.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,We've both been pretending too long.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,(grabs her) Stop pretending.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Let's stop pretending.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Come here, Janice."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Don't fight me.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Don't fight me, Janice."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,(kisses her)
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Just a minute, Janice."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Just a minute!
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"(forces her onto the floor, she scratches his face and gets away to the door which opens just as Fisher is passing by)"
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Me?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,My yeoman said that?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I've been resting here since you left me.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Alone, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Not true.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I haven't been to the Sickbay.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Let's find out what's going on.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Sickbay.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"(just missing the other Kirk nursing grazed knuckles, who goes into his quarters)"
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Us?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yeoman, look at me."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Look at me, look at my face."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Are there any scratches?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Yeoman.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I was in my room.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,It wasn't me.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Fisher saw?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,It wasn't me!
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Do you know what you're saying?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,How did all this happen?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Does the transporter work at all?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,How long will it take you to find the trouble?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,We just can't leave those four men down there.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,It's getting dark.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,They'll die.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,The surface temperature of that planet goes down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero at night.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, I know, Scotty."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, er, yes, we'll have to find him."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Search parties, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Organise search parties.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, that's right."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"We don't know, but the men have to be armed."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"The men are to be armed, with their phasers locked, I repeat, locked, on setting number one."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,There can't be any chance of him being killed.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,He's to be taken without.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"If the men are forced to fire, he can't be killed."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Tell them.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, I'll make an announcement to the entire crew, tell them what happened."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,It's a good crew.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,They deserve to know.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, I do know that, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,What I don't know is why I forgot that just now.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Mister Spock, if you see me slipping again, your orders, your orders are to tell me."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,This is the Captain speaking.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"There's an impostor aboard the ship, a man who looks exactly like me and is pretending to be me."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,This man is dangerous.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Utmost caution is to be observed.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,All crew members are to arm themselves.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,The impostor may be identified by scratches on his face.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Repeat, the impostor may be identified by scratches on his face."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Section chiefs, assign personnel to the search."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,All search parties
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,report to Mister Spock for assignment.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Something?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Oh, yes, yes."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"All hand phasers must be set on base cycle, stunning force."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,The impostor is not to be injured.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Use minimum force.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Repeat, the imposter"
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'm Captain Kirk!
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Is not to be injured.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'm Captain Kirk.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'm Captain Kirk!
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'm Captain Kirk!
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'm Captain Kirk!
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"(goes to mirror, covers scratches with makeup, opens door) Wilson!"
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Wilson, give me your phaser."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,How have you been?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"How's it going down there, Mister Sulu?"
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Isn't there any way we can help them?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Then we've got to get those men up.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"We've got to find him before he, but how?"
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,The lower levels.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,The Engineering deck.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,No.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I don't want anyone else to see the
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Mister Spock, if I'm to be the Captain, I've got to act like one."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,You can't hurt me.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,You can't kill me.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,You can't.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Don't you understand?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'm part of you.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,You need me.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I need you.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Yes.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"yes, all right."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,What's the matter with me?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"What is your point, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,For how long?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,We've located the trouble.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,It shouldn't be much longer.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'll see what we can do.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Engineering deck, Kirk here."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"That unit, Scotty, status report."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,How bad is it?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Kirk here, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I gave everybody the afternoon off.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'm watching the store.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,How is it down there?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,What happened?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,He's not dying?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, he is."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,How can he die?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Can I survive without him?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Don't be afraid.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Here's my hand.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Hold on.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,You don't have to be afraid.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I won't let go.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Hold on.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,You won't be afraid if you use your mind and think!
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Think!
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,You can do it.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,That's it!
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I have to take him back inside myself.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I can't survive without him.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I don't want him back.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"He's like an animal, a thoughtless, brutal animal, and yet it's me."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Me.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Human.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,What do I have?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Not enough.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I have a ship to command.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Coming.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,What is it?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, yes."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Go ahead.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Don't hurt him.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, yes, that sounds likely."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Get the transporter room ready.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"That sounds, sounds reasonable."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,We should double-check everything.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"No, I don't think I've for"
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, that's right."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,The men.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"We have to take the chance, Bones."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Their lives
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Help me.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Somebody make the decision.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,No.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"No, I'm not."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Mister Spock, ready the transporter room."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Bones, continue the autopsy."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Mister Sulu.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Mister Sulu.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Can't wait.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Can't let them die.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Go through the transporter, both of us."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,It's what I have to do.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,It's what I have to do.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,What we have to do.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Janice, hello."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yeoman, I owe you an explanation."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, I do."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"The transporter malfunctioned, divided me, created a duplicate."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,The animal part of me came to your cabin.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,He even scratched me to make us look more alike.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'd like the chance to explain it to you.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,You don't mind if I come to your cabin later?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,(enters turbolift) Bridge.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, I know."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Can half a man live?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Then we'll both die.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,You will.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Both of us.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,If this doesn't work.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Get those men aboard fast.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,How?
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I've seen a part of myself no man should ever see.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Good.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Thank you, Mister Spock, from both of us."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,The impostor's back where he belongs.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Let's forget him.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Thank you, Yeoman."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,This is the Captain speaking.
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Navigator, set in course correction."
KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Helmsman, steady as she goes."
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,(holding pink animal with a horn) Temperature's starting to drop.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,That's nippy.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,It's already twenty degrees below zero.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,Can't exactly
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,call it balmy.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,"Can you give us a status report, Captain?"
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,Temperature's still dropping.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,Now forty one degrees below zero.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,Do you think you might be able to find a long rope somewhere and lower us down a pot of hot coffee?
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,"Rice wine will do, if you're short on coffee."
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,(using phaser to heat rocks) I think we ought to give room service another call.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,That coffee's taking too long.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,"Enterprise, this is Sulu."
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,Hot line direct to the Captain.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,Are we that far gone?
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,"Oh, lovely, except that the frost is building up."
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,We're using hand phasers to heat the rocks.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,"One phaser quit on us, three still operating."
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,Any possibility of getting us back aboard before the skiing season opens down here?
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,"Per your training programme, Mister Spock."
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,"Captain K-Kirk, Sulu here."
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,One hundred seventeen below.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,Can't last much longer.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,"Can't see clearly, Doctor, to read top indicator."
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,Think the cold penetrating communicator.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,Two men unconscious.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,No time.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,No.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,Can't wait.
SULU,The Enemy WIthin,No time.
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,Hey!
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,"I fell off that bank, sir."
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,Cut my hand.
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, sir."
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,Geological Technician Fisher.
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,Ready to beam up.
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,I took a flop.

FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,(;eaves)
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,"No, sir."
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,"The hand's much better, sir."
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,(leaves)
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,Geological Technician Fisher.
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,"Deck twelve, section (Kirk grabs him and hits him, hard)"
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,"It was you, sir."
FISHER,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, I know what I'm saying."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,Right.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,Locked onto you.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,Energise.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,Coadjutor engagement.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,Magnetic.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,Decontaminate that uniform.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,That acted like a burnout.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"Just one moment, Captain."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,It checks out okay now.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,You better go get a synchronic meter so we can double-check.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"All right, Captain."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,Locked onto you.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"(Kirk stumbles as he leaves the platform) Are you all right, Captain?"
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,Let me give you a hand.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"Wilson will be right back, sir."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,It might profit you to let Doctor McCoy give you the once-over.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,Transporter breakdown.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,Continue circuit testing.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"We beamed up this animal and, well, look for yourself."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,It's in this specimen case.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,(opens lid to reveal angry pink animal)
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"A few seconds after they sent this one up through the transporter, that duplicate appeared."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"Except it's not a duplicate, it's an opposite."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"Two of the same animal, but different."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"One gentle, this."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"One mean and fierce, that."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"Some kind of savage, ferocious opposite."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"Captain, we don't dare send Mister Sulu and the landing party up."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,If this should happen to a man.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"I don't know sir, but when Fisher came up, his suit was covered with a soft yellow ore that had highly unusual properties."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,It may have caused an overload.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"Can't tell, not yet."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes sir, but we don't dare bring up the landing party."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,It might be duplicated like this animal.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"Can't say, sir."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"We're doing everything we can, sir."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"Mister Scott, sir, on the lower level of the Engineering deck."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,I've found a new trouble with the transporter.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,The casing has a wide gap ripped in it.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,(the phaser damage) The main circuits
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,have been burned through.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,The abort control circuit is gone altogether.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"Scott here, Captain."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,The transporter unit ioniser.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"Nothing much left of it, sir."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,We can't repair it in less than a week.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"We've found a way to get the transporter working, sir."
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,(opening box with angry animal in it) I'll grab him by the scruff of the neck and hold him as long as I can.
SCOTT,The Enemy WIthin,"If this doesn't work, I don't know what will."
WILSON,The Enemy WIthin,What happened?
WILSON,The Enemy WIthin,Onto what?
WILSON,The Enemy WIthin,Yes sir.
WILSON,The Enemy WIthin,Captain?
WILSON,The Enemy WIthin,"Are you all right, sir?"
WILSON,The Enemy WIthin,"Can I give you a hand, sir?"
WILSON,The Enemy WIthin,Captain?
WILSON,The Enemy WIthin,Sir?
WILSON,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, sir."
WILSON,The Enemy WIthin,"Fine, sir."
WILSON,The Enemy WIthin,(Kirk grabs and hits him)
UHURA,The Enemy WIthin,Bridge to all decks.
UHURA,The Enemy WIthin,"Section duty officers, check communication lines."
UHURA,The Enemy WIthin,"Captain Kirk, I have a tie-in with Sulu now."
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,"Ship's manifests, sir."
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,I think they're in order now.
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,I've checked
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, sir."
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,(leaves Kirk to lie down on bed)
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,Oh!
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,"Captain, you startled me."
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,Is there something that you?
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,"Can I help you, Captain?"
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,Oh.
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,Captain!
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,Call Mister Spock!
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,Call Mister Spock!
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,"Then he kissed me and he said that we, that he was the Captain and he could order me."
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,I didn't know what to do.
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,"When you mentioned the feelings we'd been hiding, and you started talking about us."
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,"Well, he is the captain."
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,I couldn't just.
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,You started hurting me.
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,"I had to fight you, and scratch your face."
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,I was sure I scratched you.
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,I was frightened.
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,Maybe
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,"Sir, Fisher saw you, too."
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,If it hadn't been.
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,I can understand.
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,I don't want to get you into trouble.
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,I wouldn't have even mentioned it!
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,"Captain, I"
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,No.
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,"No, sir."
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,Captain?
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,"The impostor told me what happened, who he really was, and I'd just like to say that."
RAND,The Enemy WIthin,"Well, sir, what I'd like is"
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"You picked a good day, Fisher."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,Business has been lousy.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"What'd you do, take a fall on purpose so you could get a little vacation?"
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"What can I do for you, Jim?"
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Back to that bed, bucko."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Come on, let's go."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"He'll be regaining consciousness soon, and not knowing what his physical state is, I don't think I dare give him a tranquilizer of any kind."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,I think we'd better bind him.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"You have a point, Spock?"
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,It's the Captain's guts you're analysing.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Are you of that, Spock?"
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"You have your intellect, Jim."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,You can fight with that!
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,Apparently the body functioning weakened during the duplication process.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,A fact I failed to consider.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"I don't know, Jim."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Jim, he is back!"
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Jim, you can use that brandy now."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"In fact, I'll join you."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Jim, you're no different than anyone else."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,We all have our darker side.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,We need it!
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,It's half of what we are.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"It's not really ugly, it's human."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, human."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,A lot of what he is makes you the man you are.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"God forbid I should have to agree with Spock, but he was right."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Without the negative side, you wouldn't be the Captain."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"You couldn't be, and you know it."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,Your strength of command lies mostly in him.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,You have the goodness.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"The intelligence, the logic."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"It appears your half has most of that, and perhaps that's where man's essential courage comes from."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"For you see, he was afraid and you weren't."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"He's dead, Jim."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,Autopsy in-depth.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,Hurry.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,I don't know.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,Animal could have died of some kind of shock.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"I said could have, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,We won't know until we get a full post-mortem.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Could be, if, maybe."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,All guesswork so far.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,Just theory.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Jim, why don't you give me a chance to do an autopsy and let Spock check the transporter circuits again."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Suppose it wasn't shock, Jim."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,Suppose death was caused by transporter malfunction.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,Then you'd die.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"They'd die, anyway."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Jim, you can't risk your life on a theory!"
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Well then, we can't help you, Jim."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,The decision is yours.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,No!
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,He (the one in the captain's chair) attacked him.
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"Well, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,(one figure is beamed back) Jim?
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"(as the party is wheeled away) Severe exposure and frostbite, but I think they'll make it."
MCCOY,The Enemy WIthin,"How do you feel, Jim?"
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Is there something I can do for you, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Well, Doctor McCoy seemed to think I should check on you."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Well, our good doctor said that you were acting like a wild man, demanded brandy."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Hmm.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Well, in that case, if you'll excuse the intrusion Captain, I'll get back to my work."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Captain.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Doctor McCoy reports that you demanded this brandy in Sickbay and left with it.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,I found this bottle in Yeoman Rand's quarters.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"You can go now, Yeoman."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,(Rand leaves) There's only one logical answer.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,We have an impostor aboard.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"About your double, Captain."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,We can't take a chance on killing it.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"We have no previous experience, no way of knowing what would happen to you."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"How shall we explain it to them, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,The search parties are to capture you?
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"The search parties, Captain."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realise you can't announce the full truth to the crew."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,You're the Captain of this ship.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,You haven't the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,You can't afford the luxury of being anything less than perfect.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"If you do, they lose faith, and you lose command."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Understood, Captain."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,About the phaser weapons to be set for stunning force and locked.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Thermal heaters were transported down.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,They duplicated.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,They won't operate.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Spock here.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Continue the search.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has your knowledge of the ship, its crew, its devices."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"This being the case, perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Knowing how the ship is laid out, where would you go to elude a mass search?"
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Set and locked on base cycle to stun, not to kill."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"What about your phaser, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Don't you think we ought to get some help, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Captain, you ordered me to tell you."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Judging from my observations, Captain, you're rapidly losing the power of decision."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, always, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"We have here an unusual opportunity to appraise the human mind, or to examine, in Earth terms, the roles of good and evil in a man."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"His negative side, which you call hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which Earth people express as compassion, love, tenderness."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader?"
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"We see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, if you will, properly controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"If your power of command continues to weaken, you'll soon be unable to function as Captain."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,You must be prepared for that.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain, understand it's the way I am."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"This is Spock, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,You'll have to hold on a little longer.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,There's no other way.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Survival procedures, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Captain Kirk.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Spock here.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Would you come to the transporter room.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,We think we may have found an answer.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,We've attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for the difference.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Tied directly into the impulse engines, there shouldn't be more than a five point variation in the velocity balance."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,I suggest we send the animal through.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Captain.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,It's painless and quick.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,The animal will be unconscious for only a few minutes.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,(sedates it)
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Energise.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Reverse.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,The shock of putting him back together seems to have been too much for him.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"For once, I agree with you."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified, confused."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Thus shock induced by blind terror.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,It couldn't understand.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,You can.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,You have your intelligence controlling your fear.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Aren't you forgetting something, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Your men on the planet surface.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,How much time do they have left?
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"I have a human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at war with each other."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Personal experience, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"I survive it because my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Your intelligence would enable you to survive as well.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Are you relinquishing your command, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Captain, I thought the plan"
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,We'll let the captain handle this.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"You'll have to hold on to him, Captain."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Captain?
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Understood, Captain."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,Ready.
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,(beams them out)
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Right away, Captain."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"All sections report ready, sir."
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"Shall I pass that on to the crew, sir?"
SPOCK,The Enemy WIthin,"The, er, impostor had some interesting qualities, wouldn't you say, Yeoman?"
CREWMAN,The Enemy WIthin,Mister Spock?
CREWMAN,The Enemy WIthin,Transporter Technician Wilson found injured near the Captain's cabin.
CREWMAN,The Enemy WIthin,"He says the impostor attacked him, called him by name, took his hand phaser."
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I don't need you.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"(Spock neck-pinches him, and his phaser fire hits a panel instead)"
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Help me.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,What are you going to do?
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,There's nothing I can do to stop you.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I won't fight you anymore.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Oh, I feel so weak."
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'll be glad when this is over.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,(grabs Kirk and knocks him out)
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Prepare to leave orbit, Mister Farrell."
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Well?
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"I gave you an order, Mister Farrell."
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,They can't be saved.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Prepare to leave orbit.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I've changed my mind.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Man your station, Mister Spock."
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"(McCoy enters with another Kirk, identically dressed) Grab him."
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,He's the impostor.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"McCoy, he's fooled you."
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Mister Spock, you know who I am."
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,You know what that is.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'm the captain.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Isn't that obvious?
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Look at his face.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Remember the scratches?
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Look how he's tried to hide them.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,He wants you to think that he's Captain Kirk.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,You know who I am.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"You want to kill me, don't you?"
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Farrell, James, grab him."
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,He'll destroy the ship!
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'm the Captain.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Don't you understand?
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'm captain of the ship!
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,(starts attacking the crew) I'm the captain!
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,This is my ship!
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,My ship!
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,It's mine!
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I'll kill you.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Take another step, you'll die."
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,"Please, I don't want to."
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Don't make me.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Don't make me.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,(Kirk takes phaser off him) I don't want to go back.
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,Please!
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I want to live!
OTHER KIRK,The Enemy WIthin,I want to live!
FARRELL,The Enemy WIthin,"No word from Mister Sulu, sir."
FARRELL,The Enemy WIthin,Captain!
FARRELL,The Enemy WIthin,But what about
FARRELL,The Enemy WIthin,"Yes, sir."
FARRELL,The Enemy WIthin,"Mister Spock, which one?"
FARRELL,The Enemy WIthin,What do we do?
FARRELL,The Enemy WIthin,"Status report, green."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Shall we pick some flowers, Doctor?"
KIRK,The Man Trap,When a man visits an old girlfriend she usually expects something like that.
KIRK,The Man Trap,They'll be along.
KIRK,The Man Trap,You rushed us down ten minutes early.
KIRK,The Man Trap,(enter building)
KIRK,The Man Trap,Professor Crater?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Professor?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Mrs. Crater?
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Nervous, Dr. McCoy?"
KIRK,The Man Trap,(seeing an older woman than McCoy does) Mrs. Crater.
KIRK,The Man Trap,I've heard a great deal about you.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Something wrong, Darnell?"
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Why don't you step outside, Darnell."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Maybe I'll step outside, too."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Plum?
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Professor Crater, I'm Captain Kirk."
KIRK,The Man Trap,This is
KIRK,The Man Trap,Quote.
KIRK,The Man Trap,All research personnel on alien planets are required to have their health certified by a starship surgeon at one year intervals.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Like it or not, Professor, as commander of the starship, I'm required"
KIRK,The Man Trap,"He's all yours, Plum."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,The Man Trap,She went out to get you.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Yes.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Why?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Quite all right.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"She's got some grey, Bones."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Excuse me, Professor, she's a handsome woman, yes, but hardly twenty five."
KIRK,The Man Trap,(removing a piece of plant from Darnell's mouth) McCoy.
KIRK,The Man Trap,What happened?
KIRK,The Man Trap,"I've just lost a crewman, Mrs. Crater."
KIRK,The Man Trap,I want to know what happened.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"We're well aware of our next duties, Professor."
KIRK,The Man Trap,We'll complete your examinations tomorrow.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Transporter room.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Lock onto us.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Three beaming up.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Something new to me.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Go ahead, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Stand by, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Man Trap,She said she saw him eat the plant.
KIRK,The Man Trap,There were bits of the plant in his mouth.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Then what kills a healthy man
KIRK,The Man Trap,"How your lost love affects your vision, Doctor, doesn't interest me."
KIRK,The Man Trap,I've lost a man.
KIRK,The Man Trap,I want to know what killed him.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Well?
KIRK,The Man Trap,And Professor Crater and wife?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Man Trap,What is it?
KIRK,The Man Trap,What?
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Can you explain that, Doctor?"
KIRK,The Man Trap,How?
KIRK,The Man Trap,There isn't a mark on his body.
KIRK,The Man Trap,You called that skin mottling.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"I'm not counting them, Bones."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Are you in the mood for an apology?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Perhaps you were.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Both Nancy and Crater went out of their way to mention one item they needed.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Mister Spock, outfit a landing party."
KIRK,The Man Trap,We're beaming down with some questions.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"I have, Professor."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Believe me, I have."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Where is Mrs. Crater?
KIRK,The Man Trap,"I want to talk to her, too."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Mrs. Crater.
KIRK,The Man Trap,I won't ask again.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Green, find her."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Sturgeon, transport a sample of the plant to Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Man Trap,We'll check if it's actually the Borgia plant or something we don't understand.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"(Sturgeon leaves) You got that, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Your complaint is noted, sir."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Look, something we don't understand killed one of my men."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"It could prove to be a danger to you and Mrs. Crater, too."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Bones, tell the professor what the autopsy revealed."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"And by coincidence, both you and Mrs. Crater requested salt tablets."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"We're all aware of the need for salt on a hot and arid planet like this, Professor, but it's a mystery, and I don't like mysteries."
KIRK,The Man Trap,They give me a bellyache and I've got a beauty right now.
KIRK,The Man Trap,One of the missions of the Enterprise is to protect human life in places like this.
KIRK,The Man Trap,I'm going to have to ask you and Mrs. Crater to stay aboard my ship until we find out what killed that crewman.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"But I can, Professor."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Arrange quarters for Professor and Mrs. Crater.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Did you get the plant analysis?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Professor Crater!
KIRK,The Man Trap,Professor Crater!
KIRK,The Man Trap,Professor Crater!
KIRK,The Man Trap,Professor!
KIRK,The Man Trap,Professor!
KIRK,The Man Trap,We'd better locate Crewman Green.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Green!
KIRK,The Man Trap,Green!
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Crewman Green, report!"
KIRK,The Man Trap,Green!
KIRK,The Man Trap,I don't know.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Green!
KIRK,The Man Trap,(Green arrives) Did you see this?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Crater!
KIRK,The Man Trap,"We're beaming aboard the ship, Doctor."
KIRK,The Man Trap,We can't search this whole planet on foot.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"You could learn something from Mister Spock, Doctor."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Stop thinking with your glands.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"We've equipment aboard the Enterprise that could pinpoint a match lit anywhere on this planet, or the heat of a body."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Transporter room, Kirk speaking."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Three to beam up.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Kirk to Bridge.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Break out the surface search equipment.
KIRK,The Man Trap,I want co-ordinates on two people.
KIRK,The Man Trap,There's a body down there.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Sturgeon.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"You could use some sleep, Bones."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Bridge.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Professor and Nancy Crater.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Expand search radius.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Lieutenant Uhura to the Bridge.
KIRK,The Man Trap,(the crewman begins to reach for her face) Lieutenant Uhura to the Bridge.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Lieutenant Uhura, report to the Bridge."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Nothing to report, Doctor."
KIRK,The Man Trap,We haven't located Mrs. Crater.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"What's the matter, can't you sleep?"
KIRK,The Man Trap,Try taking one of those red pills you gave me last week.
KIRK,The Man Trap,You'll sleep.
KIRK,The Man Trap,All right.
KIRK,The Man Trap,We'll triangulate on him.
KIRK,The Man Trap,We'll let Professor Crater explain what happened to his wife.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"(to Uhura) Remember my instructions, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Keep a tight fix on us.
KIRK,The Man Trap,If we let out a yell I want an armed party down there before the echo dies.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Professor Crater.
KIRK,The Man Trap,We?
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Where's your wife, Professor?"
KIRK,The Man Trap,We're concerned about her.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Where's your wife, Professor?"
KIRK,The Man Trap,We're worried about her safety.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Aren't you?
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Professor, you're a reasonable man, let me (comm."
KIRK,The Man Trap,beep) Kirk here.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Stand by, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Spock has something.
KIRK,The Man Trap,He beamed up to the ship with us.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Enterprise from Kirk.
KIRK,The Man Trap,You have an intruder aboard.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Could be masquerading as Crewman Green.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"General quarters, security condition three."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Negative, Lieutenant, but keep locked in on us."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Let's get him.
KIRK,The Man Trap,(phaser fire)
KIRK,The Man Trap,Set your phaser on one quarter.
KIRK,The Man Trap,I'll leave mine on stun.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"He's not trying to kill us, he's trying to frighten us, and he's doing a pretty good job."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Set.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Your wife, Professor."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Where is she?
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Your wife, Professor."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Where is she?
KIRK,The Man Trap,The last of her kind?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Just stunned.
KIRK,The Man Trap,You'll be able to think in a minute.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Where's your wife?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Where is she now?
KIRK,The Man Trap,When?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"It's definite, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Man Trap,The intruder can assume any shape.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Crewmen, you, myself, anyone."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Do you understand?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Go to GQ four.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Kirk to transporter room.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Three to beam up.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"There's one, Professor."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Your creature is killing my people.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Yeoman Rand, how long was this Green with you?"
KIRK,The Man Trap,Mister Spock?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Dr. McCoy?
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Medical department report, Doctor."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Continue the search.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Crater, we don't know who or what we're looking for."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"We need your help, and now."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Can you recognise this thing When you see it?
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Professor, I'll forego charges up to this point but this creature's aboard my ship and I'll have it, or I'll have your skin, or both."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Now where is it?
KIRK,The Man Trap,And it becomes Nancy for you.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"You bleed too much, Crater."
KIRK,The Man Trap,You're too pure and noble.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Are you saving the last of its kind or has this become Crater's private heaven, here on this planet?"
KIRK,The Man Trap,"This thing becomes wife, lover, best friend, wise man, fool, idol, slave."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"It isn't a bad life to have everyone in the universe at your beck and call, and you win all the arguments."
KIRK,The Man Trap,Have you learned to see this thing in whatever form it becomes?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Are you going to help us find it?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Doctor?
KIRK,The Man Trap,Take him.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Dead.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"But it had you, too."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Move aside, Bones."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"She's not Nancy, Bones."
KIRK,The Man Trap,It killed four crewmen.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Now Crater.
KIRK,The Man Trap,The creature.
KIRK,The Man Trap,It kills.
KIRK,The Man Trap,It needs salt to live.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Bones, move aside."
KIRK,The Man Trap,My guess is she needs more.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"You want it, Nancy?"
KIRK,The Man Trap,Come and get it.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Not fright.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Hunger.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Look at her.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Come on.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"You want this, Nancy?"
KIRK,The Man Trap,Come on Nancy.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Come and get it.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Come and get it.
KIRK,The Man Trap,Here it is.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"McCoy, get out of the way!"
KIRK,The Man Trap,Get out of the way.
KIRK,The Man Trap,"I'm sorry, Bones."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"I was thinking about the buffalo, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Man Trap,"Warp one, Mister Sulu."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Is that how you get girls to like you, by bribing them?"
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"There doesn't seem to be anybody around, does there."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Yeah, a little bit, I guess."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"You see, we walked out of each other's lives ten years ago."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"She married Crater, and for all I know she may have forgotten me completely."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Of all the bonehead ideas, Jim, how'd I let myself in for things like this?"
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Nancy.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,It's good to see you.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,You haven't aged a day.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Oh, this is Captain Jim Kirk of the Enterprise."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,And Crewman Darnell.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"A little less mouth, Darnell."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Plum.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"I'll, er, I'll wait for the professor and I'll catch you both at once."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,I'm pleased you're doing well but I'm required to confirm that fact.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,What you want is unimportant right now.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,What you will get is required by the book.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Sit down and breathe deeply, please."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,You did.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,That's me.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Didn't she mention I was here?
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Well, it certainly hasn't aged her."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,She looks exactly as I knew her twelve years ago.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Amazing, Jim."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Like a girl of twenty five.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"I'm not joking, Jim."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,She hasn't aged a day.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,She doesn't have a grey hair on her head.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Well at any rate she doesn't look a day over thirty.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Open your mouth.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,The machine is capable of almost anything but I'll still put my trust in a healthy set of tonsils.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Now, open your mouth."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"(a woman screams, they dash out, Kirk with his phaser drawn)"
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Dead, Jim."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Strange.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,A red mottling all over his face.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Take it easy, Nancy."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Just tell us what you know.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"No, no, no, no, it's not that."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,It's something entirely different.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Jim, I suppose we could complete these examinations later."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,She called it a Borgia plant.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Hmm.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Well then, this man wasn't poisoned."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,She's mistaken.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"I know alkaloid poison, what to look for."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,There's not a trace of it in his body.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Jim, don't tell me my business."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,He could not have swallowed any.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,My instruments would have picked up any trace of it whatsoever.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,I'll tell you something else.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,This man shouldn't be dead.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,I can't find anything wrong with him.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,According to all the tests he should just get up and walk away from here.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,I don't know.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,I'll have the tests double-checked.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,My eyes may be tricking me.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"I swear, Jim, when I first saw her she looked just as I'd known her ten years ago."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Granted, for a moment I may have been looking at her through a romantic haze."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Yes, sir."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Dispensary to Captain.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,We found something.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,I'd rather not put it on the speaker.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,So improbable we almost didn't check it.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,This man has no salt in his body at all.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"I can't, except that what we normally carry in our bodies is gone from his."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Except the red rings on his face.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"I thought it was, sir."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Another error on my part.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Oh, forget it."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,I probably was mooning over her.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,I should have been thinking about my job.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Salt tablets.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Our crewman died of salt depletion.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Sudden, total loss of it."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Medically impossible by any standards.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,(checking tablets) Salt.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Jim, he's run off."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Professor Crater!
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Jim!
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Jim, it's Sturgeon."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,He's dead.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Crewman Green, report!"
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Green!
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Green, where are you?"
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Could it be Crater?
MCCOY,The Man Trap,He came this way.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Same red rings on his face.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Have you seen Nancy, Mrs. Crater?"
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"I'm worried about her, Jim."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"She's not at the quarters, she's not at the diggings."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,She could be in trouble.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Nancy!
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Nancy, it's Leonard!"
MCCOY,The Man Trap,You can't leave her!
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Jim!
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"All right, Jim."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,McCoy to Bridge.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Captain there?
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Nope.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Nancy.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Well, come in."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,come in.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,I've been worried sick about you.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,I wonder why Jim didn't tell me he found you.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Well.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Nancy, er"
MCCOY,The Man Trap,You're as bad as Jim Kirk.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,He's been telling me to take these.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,(lying on bed) I was so worried.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Your husband acting strange, crewmen dying."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"The creature leading you a merry chase, Mister Sulu?"
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Or whatever it is that's killing the crewmen.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Perhaps I can help.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Fill me in.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Yes?
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Oh.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Well, we could offer it salt without tricks."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,There's no reason for it to attack us.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"No, it's simply trying to survive by using its natural ability to take other forms."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"And like us, it's an intelligent animal."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,There's no need to hunt it down.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Well, I resist using it, but in this case the professor will give us the truth."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Oh, yes."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Of course.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Easy, easy."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Nobodies going to
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"What's going on here, Jim?"
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Are you insane?
MCCOY,The Man Trap,It?
MCCOY,The Man Trap,No!
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"You're frightening her, Jim."
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Stop it, Jim!"
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Are you out of your mind?
MCCOY,The Man Trap,No!
MCCOY,The Man Trap,No!
MCCOY,The Man Trap,I won't shoot Nancy.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Stop it!
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Stop it, Spock!"
MCCOY,The Man Trap,Stop it!
MCCOY,The Man Trap,(Nancy sends Spock flying with one slap)
MCCOY,The Man Trap,No.
MCCOY,The Man Trap,(she goes to Kirk again) No!
MCCOY,The Man Trap,"Lord, forgive me."
NANCY,The Man Trap,"(singing outside, then enters) Leonard!"
NANCY,The Man Trap,Hello.
NANCY,The Man Trap,Let me look at you.
NANCY,The Man Trap,"All good, I hope."
NANCY,The Man Trap,What?
NANCY,The Man Trap,And let Plum examine me all alone?
NANCY,The Man Trap,A nickname I gave Leonard when we were very young.
NANCY,The Man Trap,I'd better go get Bob.
NANCY,The Man Trap,"Every time he starts digging he forgets time, sleep, food, everything."
NANCY,The Man Trap,Be back in a minute.
NANCY,The Man Trap,"Well, I, I"
NANCY,The Man Trap,I was just.
NANCY,The Man Trap,"I couldn't find Bob, and I was coming back."
NANCY,The Man Trap,I crossed to your crewman.
NANCY,The Man Trap,I wanted him to know I wasn't offended by the things he'd said back there.
NANCY,The Man Trap,You remember.
NANCY,The Man Trap,"Then I, I noticed he had a Borgia plant in his hand."
NANCY,The Man Trap,"Before I could say anything, he, he'd taken a bite from it."
NANCY,The Man Trap,"He fell, his face all twisted, and."
NANCY,The Man Trap,"Leonard, you're looking at me like you don't believe me."
NANCY,The Man Trap,Salt.
NANCY,The Man Trap,You did ask them about more salt tablets?
NANCY,The Man Trap,"I'm so happy to see you, Leonard."
NANCY,The Man Trap,"The others, they, I, I don't relate to them as much as you."
NANCY,The Man Trap,You have such strong memories of me.
NANCY,The Man Trap,"You do care, don't you, Leonard?"
NANCY,The Man Trap,"It makes me feel so, so safe."
NANCY,The Man Trap,My husband?
NANCY,The Man Trap,I like your feelings better.
NANCY,The Man Trap,Much stronger.
NANCY,The Man Trap,"But you're tired, You need to rest."
NANCY,The Man Trap,I think you should.
NANCY,The Man Trap,I'll get you some water.
NANCY,The Man Trap,"You're so tired, darling."
NANCY,The Man Trap,Just rest now.
NANCY,The Man Trap,"It's nothing, dear."
NANCY,The Man Trap,It's nothing.
NANCY,The Man Trap,You just sleep.
NANCY,The Man Trap,Nancy will take care of everything.
NANCY,The Man Trap,Leonard.
NANCY,The Man Trap,"Leonard, wake up."
NANCY,The Man Trap,Please help me.
NANCY,The Man Trap,"Help me, Leonard."
NANCY,The Man Trap,They're trying to kill me.
NANCY,The Man Trap,Don't let them kill me!
NANCY,The Man Trap,But you must help me!
NANCY,The Man Trap,"Leonard, if you love me, make him go away."
NANCY,The Man Trap,"Leonard, help me."
NANCY,The Man Trap,Leonard.
NANCY,The Man Trap,"Leonard, no."
NANCY,The Man Trap,"Leonard, please."
DARNELL,The Man Trap,"(seeing a young blonde) How do you do, ma'am?"
DARNELL,The Man Trap,"Excuse me sir but, ma'am, if I didn't know better I would swear you were someone I left behind on Wrigley's Pleasure Planet."
DARNELL,The Man Trap,"It's funny, you're exactly like a girl that"
DARNELL,The Man Trap,I'm sorry.
DARNELL,The Man Trap,I didn't mean to.
DARNELL,The Man Trap,"I mean, I know it's impossible, of course."
DARNELL,The Man Trap,"Yes, sir."
DARNELL,The Man Trap,"Thank you, sir."
BLONDE NANCY,The Man Trap,"It's quite warm here, isn't it?"
BLONDE NANCY,The Man Trap,(encourages Darnell to follow her)
CRATER,The Man Trap,The heroic Captain and the intrepid doctor cross interstellar space to preserve our health.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Your sense of duty is overwhelming.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Now will you please go back where you came from and tell whoever issues your orders to leave me and my wife alone.
CRATER,The Man Trap,We need salt against the heat.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"Aside from that, we're doing very well, thank you."
CRATER,The Man Trap,Doubtless the good surgeon will enjoy prodding and poking us with his arcane machinery.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"Go away, we don't want you."
CRATER,The Man Trap,To show your gold braid to everyone.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"You love it, don't you."
CRATER,The Man Trap,Did I hear you call him Doctor McCoy?
CRATER,The Man Trap,McCoy.
CRATER,The Man Trap,I've heard Nancy speak of a Doctor McCoy.
CRATER,The Man Trap,You've seen Nancy?
CRATER,The Man Trap,You've seen her too?
CRATER,The Man Trap,You were with the good Doctor?
CRATER,The Man Trap,Nothing.
CRATER,The Man Trap,It's just that it gives me pleasure to know that she's gotten to see an old friend and has a chance for some company.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"It's different for me, I enjoy solitude."
CRATER,The Man Trap,But for a woman.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"You understand, of course."
CRATER,The Man Trap,Sorry.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"I'm sorry, Captain, sit down."
CRATER,The Man Trap,I seem to have forgotten my manners.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"You've seen my wife with the eyes of your past attachment, Doctor."
CRATER,The Man Trap,"I'm sure when Nancy lets, when you see her again she'll be a believable age."
CRATER,The Man Trap,Genuine affection.
CRATER,The Man Trap,I'm glad you still feel it for her.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"Leonard, isn't it?"
CRATER,The Man Trap,She's a fine woman.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"Why, I thought the machine"
CRATER,The Man Trap,"What do you suppose happened, Captain?"
CRATER,The Man Trap,You beam down a crewman who doesn't know better than to eat an untested plant.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"We don't need an examination, you can see that."
CRATER,The Man Trap,Perhaps you'd better take your man and
CRATER,The Man Trap,"I'll take care of the provisioning, Nancy."
CRATER,The Man Trap,"One might think that you had more important duties than harassing people, Captain."
CRATER,The Man Trap,"Captain, you can't just beam down here and bully us, and interfere with our work."
CRATER,The Man Trap,Possibly at the other diggings.
CRATER,The Man Trap,We don't keep military logs
CRATER,The Man Trap,"Captain, considering the inescapable fact that you are a trespasser on my planet"
CRATER,The Man Trap,We've been here for almost five years.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"If there were anything hostile here we would know about it, wouldn't we?"
CRATER,The Man Trap,And your esteemed physician cannot explain our need for salt tablets?
CRATER,The Man Trap,(opening storage box) Nancy and I started with twenty five pounds.
CRATER,The Man Trap,This is what we have left.
CRATER,The Man Trap,(a few tablets at the bottom of a jar) Now what is so mysterious about that?
CRATER,The Man Trap,But you can't do that.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Nancy!
CRATER,The Man Trap,You!
CRATER,The Man Trap,Salt!
CRATER,The Man Trap,I've got salt!
CRATER,The Man Trap,Smell it!
CRATER,The Man Trap,"Smell it, Nancy!"
CRATER,The Man Trap,Go away!
CRATER,The Man Trap,We don't want you here.
CRATER,The Man Trap,I'm armed.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Go away.
CRATER,The Man Trap,She's no concern of yours.
CRATER,The Man Trap,We don't want you here!
CRATER,The Man Trap,We're happy alone!
CRATER,The Man Trap,I'll kill to stay alone.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"You hear that, Kirk?"
CRATER,The Man Trap,Or you'll have to kill me.
CRATER,The Man Trap,II don't care either way.
CRATER,The Man Trap,She was the last of her kind.
CRATER,The Man Trap,The last of its kind.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"Earth history, remember?"
CRATER,The Man Trap,Like the passenger pigeon or buffalo.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Ooh!
CRATER,The Man Trap,I feel strange.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Once there were millions of them prairies black with them.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"One herd covered three whole states, and when they moved they were like thunder."
CRATER,The Man Trap,Like the creatures here.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Once there were millions of them.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Now there's one left.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Nancy understood.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Dead.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Buried up on the hill.
CRATER,The Man Trap,It killed her.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"Oh, a year, or was it two?"
CRATER,The Man Trap,The creature was trying to survive.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"It has that right, doesn't it?"
CRATER,The Man Trap,They needed salt to stay alive.
CRATER,The Man Trap,There was no more salt.
CRATER,The Man Trap,It's the last one.
CRATER,The Man Trap,The buffalo.
CRATER,The Man Trap,There is no difference.
CRATER,The Man Trap,(eyeing McCoy carefully) The creature is not dangerous when fed.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"The way the chameleon uses its protective colouring, an ability retained no doubt from its primitive state, the way we have retained our incisor teeth."
CRATER,The Man Trap,They were once fangs.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Certain of our muscles were designed for chase.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"It uses its ability the way we would use our muscles and teeth if necessary, to stay alive."
CRATER,The Man Trap,"I demanded, I even begged that you get off my planet."
CRATER,The Man Trap,I loved Nancy very much.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Few women like my Nancy.
CRATER,The Man Trap,She lives in my dreams.
CRATER,The Man Trap,She walks and sings in them.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Not because of tricks.
CRATER,The Man Trap,It doesn't trick me.
CRATER,The Man Trap,It needs love as much as it needs salt.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"When it killed Nancy, I almost destroyed it but, it isn't just a beast."
CRATER,The Man Trap,It is intelligent and the last of its kind.
CRATER,The Man Trap,You don't understand.
CRATER,The Man Trap,Yes.
CRATER,The Man Trap,"Sorry, I can't."
CREWMAN,The Man Trap,"Transporter room, Captain."
CREWMAN,The Man Trap,Transporter room to Bridge.
CREWMAN,The Man Trap,Landing party returning.
CREWMAN,The Man Trap,They report one death.
CREWMAN,The Man Trap,"In a way, ma'am."
CREWMAN,The Man Trap,You were just thinking of someone like me.
CREWMAN,The Man Trap,"I'm guessing of course, but you do look a little lonely."
CREWMAN,The Man Trap,Ina cuvanea mwanamke turee.
CREWMAN,The Man Trap,Captain Kirk to dispensary.
CREWMAN,The Man Trap,Captain Kirk to dispensary.
SCOTT,The Man Trap,"Locked onto you, Captain."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Miss Uhura, your last sub-space log contained an error in the frequencies column."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Cry?
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Well, since it is illogical for a communications officer to resent the word frequency, I have no answer."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Bridge acknowledging.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Explain.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Lieutenant, my demonstration of concern will not change what happened."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,The transporter room is very well-manned and they will call if they need my assistance.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Bridge to Dispensary.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Borgia plant listed in library record tapes as carbon group three vegetation similar to Earth nightshade family.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Alkaloid poison.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Chemical structure common to class M planets.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,About the strange mottling on his facial skin surface.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,There is no reference to this symptom.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,No mistake in our record tapes.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Borgia plant.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Its sole deadly property is alkaloid poison.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Check out perfectly.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,They arrived here nearly five years ago.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Visited by various vessels, made fairly heavy shipments out, of artefacts and reports."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"However, there has been a marked drop in shipments during the last year."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Fascinating.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Sodium chloride.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Not a trace of it.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,He would die almost instantly.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Standing by.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Complete analysis.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Spock here.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"It is the Borgia variety, Captain."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Could not have caused Darnell's death.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Spock here.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Something odd, Captain."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,You said two people.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"We get a reading on only one person, probably Crater."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,He's circling as if searching for something.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"The simple fact is unless there's something seriously wrong with the ship's equipment, there's only one person within a one hundred mile circle."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Spock cutting in, Captain."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Something here, through the arches to your left."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Green.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Or something did.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Crater knows the creature.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,If we could take him alive.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Obviously, taking him alive is going to be difficult."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Why risk your life for his?
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Crater!
SPOCK,The Man Trap,(Kirk fires his phaser)
SPOCK,The Man Trap,The Earth buffalo.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,What about it?
SPOCK,The Man Trap,And now they're gone.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Is that what you mean?
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Always in the past tense.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Supplies of salt have been set out as bait at all decks and engineering levels, Captain."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"However, no one or nothing has approached them as yet."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Your attitude is laudable, Doctor, but your reasoning is reckless."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"A very interesting hypothesis, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Briefing room.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Recommend we use truth serum, Captain."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"I'll accompany you, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,(on biobed) It wasn't McCoy.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,It was the creature.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,It hit me.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Crater grabbed my phaser.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,I wondered about McCoy.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,Doubt had crossed my mind.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Fortunately, my ancestors spawned in another ocean than yours did."
SPOCK,The Man Trap,My blood cells are quite different.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,It's killing the Captain.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Shoot it, Doctor, quickly!"
SPOCK,The Man Trap,It's killing the captain!
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Shoot, quick!"
SPOCK,The Man Trap,This is not Nancy.
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"(hitting her repeatedly) If she were Nancy, could she take this?"
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Is that Nancy, Doctor?"
SPOCK,The Man Trap,"Something wrong, Captain?"
UHURA,The Man Trap,"Mister Spock, sometimes I think if I hear that word frequency once more, I'll cry."
UHURA,The Man Trap,I was just trying to start a conversation.
UHURA,The Man Trap,"No, you have an answer."
UHURA,The Man Trap,I'm an illogical woman who's beginning to feel too much a part of that communications console.
UHURA,The Man Trap,"Why don't you tell me I'm an attractive young lady, or ask me if I've ever been in love?"
UHURA,The Man Trap,Tell me how your planet Vulcan looks on a lazy evening when the moon is full.
UHURA,The Man Trap,"I'm not surprised, Mister Spock."
UHURA,The Man Trap,I don't believe it.
UHURA,The Man Trap,You explain.
UHURA,The Man Trap,That means that somebody is dead and you just sit there.
UHURA,The Man Trap,It could be Captain Kirk.
UHURA,The Man Trap,He's the closest thing you have to a friend.
UHURA,The Man Trap,"Message, Captain."
UHURA,The Man Trap,"Starship base on Caran 4 requesting explanation of our delay here, sir."
UHURA,The Man Trap,Space Commander Dominguez says we have supplies he urgently needs.
UHURA,The Man Trap,"Got it, Captain."
UHURA,The Man Trap,I see.
UHURA,The Man Trap,"So naturally, when I'm lonely I think of you."
UHURA,The Man Trap,Una kafeeri Hur.
UHURA,The Man Trap,You're Swahili?
UHURA,The Man Trap,Lieutenant Uhura.
UHURA,The Man Trap,"On my way, sir."
UHURA,The Man Trap,"Yes, Captain."
UHURA,The Man Trap,Medical department alert.
UHURA,The Man Trap,Doctors and medics acknowledge.
UHURA,The Man Trap,Dr. McCoy to the Bridge.
UHURA,The Man Trap,Dr. McCoy to the Bridge.
UHURA,The Man Trap,(Nancy changes to McCoy) Dr. McCoy to the Bridge.
UHURA,The Man Trap,"Reporting GQ three secure, Captain."
UHURA,The Man Trap,Do you require assistance there?
UHURA,The Man Trap,He's not in supply and maintenance.
UHURA,The Man Trap,Check.
UHURA,The Man Trap,He must have been it.
UHURA,The Man Trap,"You know, I would have remembered a crewman like him."
UHURA,The Man Trap,"Negative, Captain."
UHURA,The Man Trap,I've checked every face on this vessel.
UHURA,The Man Trap,It was not a crewman I saw.
GREEN,The Man Trap,"Yes, sir."
GREEN,The Man Trap,(leaves)
GREEN,The Man Trap,"Yes, sir."
GREEN,The Man Trap,Sturgeon was dead when I found him.
GREEN,The Man Trap,I was circling to find whatever it was.
GREEN,The Man Trap,"No, sir."
GREEN,The Man Trap,I checked all through the ruins.
TRANSPORTER OPERATOR,The Man Trap,"We'll bring him home, sir."
RAND,The Man Trap,"Oh, Green, what went on down there?"
RAND,The Man Trap,(he reaches for the salt cellar) Who do you think you are?
RAND,The Man Trap,Why don't you go chase an asteroid?
RAND,The Man Trap,Don't you wish it was?
RAND,The Man Trap,"Where are you, Sulu?"
RAND,The Man Trap,I've got your tray.
RAND,The Man Trap,Thank you.
RAND,The Man Trap,"Hello, Beauregard."
RAND,The Man Trap,"How are you today, darling?"
RAND,The Man Trap,"No, it's a he plant."
RAND,The Man Trap,A girl can tell.
RAND,The Man Trap,He is not an inanimate object.
RAND,The Man Trap,He's so animate he makes me nervous.
RAND,The Man Trap,"In fact, I keep expecting one of these plants of yours to grab me."
RAND,The Man Trap,He's not talking today.
RAND,The Man Trap,You been nipping saurian brandy or something?
RAND,The Man Trap,He's the real spook.
RAND,The Man Trap,Suppose he's going space happy or something?
RAND,The Man Trap,I'd better get this tray back.
RAND,The Man Trap,"Bye, Beauregard."
RAND,The Man Trap,Look at his face!
RAND,The Man Trap,"And he, or rather it, followed me."
RAND,The Man Trap,I thought there was something twitchy about him.
RAND,The Man Trap,"As long as he, it thought it could get to the salt on my tray, sir."
RAND,The Man Trap,Captain.
RAND,The Man Trap,Professor Crater.
REDSHIRT,The Man Trap,"Hey, Janice, is that for me?"
REDSHIRT,The Man Trap,"Yeah, how'd you like to have her as your personal yeoman?"
BLUESHIRT,The Man Trap,How about that?
SULU,The Man Trap,"In here feeding the weepers, Janice."
SULU,The Man Trap,May the Great Bird of the Galaxy bless your planet.
SULU,The Man Trap,Her name's Gertrude.
SULU,The Man Trap,"Why do people have to call inanimate objects she, like she's a fast ship."
SULU,The Man Trap,"Hello, Green."
SULU,The Man Trap,(stroking plant) Take it easy.
SULU,The Man Trap,Calm down.
SULU,The Man Trap,Very sensitive.
SULU,The Man Trap,"Wait a minute, I'll walk along."
SULU,The Man Trap,Bridge.
SULU,The Man Trap,Sulu.
SULU,The Man Trap,"Trouble on deck nine, section two."
SULU,The Man Trap,We need a medical team.
SULU,The Man Trap,"Casualty, Captain."
SULU,The Man Trap,Barnhart was found dead on deck nine.
SULU,The Man Trap,Same symptoms.
SULU,The Man Trap,Bridge.
SULU,The Man Trap,Sulu.
SULU,The Man Trap,"GQ security three, sir."
SULU,The Man Trap,General quarters three.
SULU,The Man Trap,Intruder alert.
SULU,The Man Trap,GQ three.
SULU,The Man Trap,Intruder alert.
SULU,The Man Trap,General quarters three.
SULU,The Man Trap,Intruder alert.
SULU,The Man Trap,GQ three.
SULU,The Man Trap,Intruder alert.
SULU,The Man Trap,"GQ three now secured except for decks five, seven, and ten."
SULU,The Man Trap,"Come in, please."
SULU,The Man Trap,Go to Engineering now.
SULU,The Man Trap,Run through file photos of the crewmen there.
SULU,The Man Trap,"Keep in mind if you find him, he's not Crewman Green."
SULU,The Man Trap,The Captain reports Crewman Green is dead.
SULU,The Man Trap,"He, whatever, was probably your crewman, too, Lieutenant."
SULU,The Man Trap,The creature?
SULU,The Man Trap,Bridge to Captain.
SULU,The Man Trap,Sulu here.
SULU,The Man Trap,"Affirmative, Captain."
SULU,The Man Trap,"General quarters four, Captain."
SULU,The Man Trap,"Deck five, section three."
SULU,The Man Trap,"Deck five, section three."
SULU,The Man Trap,Report.
SULU,The Man Trap,"Ready to leave orbit, Captain."
SULU,The Man Trap,"Warp one, sir."
SULU,The Man Trap,Leaving orbit.
SECURITY,The Man Trap,Deck five reporting.
SECURITY,The Man Trap,Crewman Green is not in his quarters.
SECURITY,The Man Trap,No one has seen him
SECURITY,The Man Trap,Security 3 A here.
SECURITY,The Man Trap,3 B in sight.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Check out the life-support systems.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Someone strangled this woman.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Dead?
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Engineer at his post?
SPOCK,The Naked Time,The rest?
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Be certain we expose ourselves to nothing.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Spock here.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Do you read, Enterprise?"
SPOCK,The Naked Time,All station personnel are dead.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Unknown, Captain."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,It's like nothing we've dealt with before.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"You received my signal, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"The readings are perfectly normal for me, Doctor, thank you, and as for my anatomy being different from yours, I am delighted."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Captain.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"I wish I could say, Captain."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"The circumstances were quite bizarre, however our record tapes may show us something."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Next tape, please."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Thank you.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,He'd used the computer room as if it were an amusement gallery.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"It could be some form of space madness we've never heard of, but it would have to be caused by something."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Our spectro-readings showed no contamination, no unusual elements present."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Instruments register only those things they're designed to register.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Space still contains infinite unknowns.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"We will need top efficiency, Captain."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,It'll be a tricky orbit.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"When the planet begins to go, there may be drastic changes in gravity, mass, magnetic field."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,It's beginning.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Unusually rapid shifts.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"All scanning stations manned, all recorders functioning, Captain."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Obviously, this planet is condensing more rapidly than expected."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,A valuable study.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,We may be seeing Earth's distant future.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Before its sun went dark, this planet was remarkably similar to yours."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Psychiatric file, personality quotients."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,It's doubtful he meant to.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"He was confused, self-tortured."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,His capacity for self-doubt has always been rather high.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,What puzzles me is what brought it to the surface with so much force.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Planet breakup is imminent, Captain."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Shrinking in size at an increasing rate.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"As the planet continues to shrink in size, its surface moves away from us."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Exactly.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,We must be prepared to respond instantly to any sudden change.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Rate of compaction seems constant.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Why isn't Mister Sulu at this station?
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Take over here, Rand."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"(a male, not Janice)"
SPOCK,The Naked Time,You haven't answered my question.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Where is Mister Sulu?
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"You're relieved, Mister Riley."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Lieutenant Uhura, take over this station."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Security.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Mister Riley is headed for Sickbay.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,See to it he arrives.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Captain Kirk to the Bridge.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Lieutenant Brent, relieve Miss Uhura."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Nonviolent at this stage.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Slightly disoriented.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Riley seemed rather pleased with himself, as if he were"
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Precisely.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Fascinating.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,A pattern is developing.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"First, Tormolen."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Hidden personality traits being forced to the surface.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Then Riley, who fancies himself a descendant of Irish kings, and now Sulu, who is at heart a swashbuckler out of your 18th century."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Gravity pull increasing.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,We've shifted to two percent and should stabilise our position.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Engine room, we need power!"
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Take D'Artagnon here to Sickbay.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Captain.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"At our present rate of descent, we have less than twenty minutes before we enter planet atmosphere."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Status reports, all sections."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Go to Alert Baker two.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Seal off main sections.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"We're going to seal off, Captain, if we can minimise the spread of whatever this is."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"No way, Captain."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,He controls the main power panels.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,He can override any channel from down there.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Seventeen minutes left, sir."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,(ship is jolted severely)
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Sixteen minutes left, Captain."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"We've stabilised, but still spiraling down."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Crewman, report to the lab!"
SPOCK,The Naked Time,What's going on?
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Crewman, stand aside."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Message from the captain.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,We have fourteen minutes left.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll take a minute and a half more than we have left."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,You can't afford a safety factor.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Nurse?
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Where is Doctor McCoy?
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Lab.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Lab, respond please."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Spock here.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Lab!
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"What is it, Nurse?"
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Nurse, you should"
SPOCK,The Naked Time,I'm in control of my emotions.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,I'm sorry.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,I am sorry.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Christine.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,(close to tears) I'm in control of my emotions.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Control of my emotions.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,I am an officer.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,An officer.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,My duty.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"My duty is, is."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"My duty is to, to."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Too late.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,I'm sorry.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,To.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Two, four, six."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Six.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Six times six.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,My mother.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,I could never tell her I loved her.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"An Earth woman, living on a planet where love, emotion, is bad taste."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"I respected my father, our customs."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,I was ashamed of my Earth blood.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"(Kirk slaps him) Jim, when I feel friendship for you, I'm ashamed."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,t's never been done!
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Understand, Jim."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,I've spent a whole lifetime learning to hide my feelings.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,(finally hits Kirk back)
SPOCK,The Naked Time,It's never been done.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Jim.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Jim, there is an intermix formula."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,It's never been tested.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,It's a theoretical relationship between time and antimatter.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Stand by to intermix.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,I'll call the formulae in from the Bridge.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Fuel temperature.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Raise antimatter eight and forty degrees.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,We haven't the time.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,We'll have to risk it.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Bridge, we're ready."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Are you all right, Jim?"
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Obviously, we were successful."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,The engines imploded.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,Engine power went off the scale as well.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,We're now travelling faster than is possible for normal space.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"We're back to normal time, Captain."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,We've regressed in time seventy one hours.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"It is now three days ago, Captain."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,We have three days to live over again.
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain."
SPOCK,The Naked Time,"Since the formula worked, we can go back in time, to any planet, any era."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"Right, sir."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"All life systems were off, sir."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"Right, sir."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"Well, better look for yourself, Mister Spock."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,One man was taking a shower fully clothed.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"(they split up, he takes off his glove to scratch his nose then puts it on the console."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Something orange jumps onto his skin.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Feeling the cold he puts the glove back on)
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"Terrible, Captain."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,It was terrible.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"They were just sitting, like they didn't care."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"Whatever was happening, they didn't care."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,I keep wondering
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Six dead.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Six people dead.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"Yes, sir."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Get off me!
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"You don't rank me and you don't have pointed ears, so just get off my neck!"
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Nothing!
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,We're all a bunch of hypocrites.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Sticking our noses into something that we've got no business.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"What are we doing out here, anyway?"
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"We bring pain and trouble with us, leave men and women stuck out on freezing planets until they die."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,What are we doing out here in space?
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Good?
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,What good?
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"We're polluting it, destroying it."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,We've got no business being out here.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,No business.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"If a man was supposed to fly, he'd have wings."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,"If he was supposed to be out in space, he wouldn't need air to breathe, wouldn't need life-support systems to keep him from freezing to death."
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,We don't belong here.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,It's not ours.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Not ours.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Destroying and watching.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,We don't belong.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,I don't belong.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Six people died down there.
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Why do I deserve to live?
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Let go!
TORMOLEN,The Naked Time,Let me go.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Kirk, affirmative."
KIRK,The Naked Time,What caused it?
KIRK,The Naked Time,Captain here.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Better have Medicine look them over too.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Tell Mister Spock I'll meet him there in ten minutes.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Naked Time,How are they?
KIRK,The Naked Time,You keep wondering if man was meant to be out here.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"You keep wondering, you keep signing on."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Any guesses, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Naked Time,Any idea of what happened down there?
KIRK,The Naked Time,You'd better get some rest.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Set up those tapes, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Naked Time,We'll see if the answers are there.
KIRK,The Naked Time,(leaves with Spock)
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Almost as though they were irrational, drugged."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"An engineer sitting there, apparently oblivious to everything."
KIRK,The Naked Time,A woman strangled.
KIRK,The Naked Time,A crewman with a phaser pistol in his hand.
KIRK,The Naked Time,And a fully clothed man frozen to death in a shower.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"If the image wasn't so ugly, it would be laughable."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Not even a theory, gentlemen?"
KIRK,The Naked Time,Earth Science needs the closest possible measurement of the breakup of this planet.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"To do this, we need the Enterprise in a critically tight orbit."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Question.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Could what happened down there to those people create any unusual danger to this vessel and crew?
KIRK,The Naked Time,"The purpose of a briefing, gentlemen, is to get me answers based on your abilities and experience."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"In a critical orbit, there's no time for surprise."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"On our way, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"I'll hold you to that half second, Scotty."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Compensate, Mister Riley."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Mister Spock?
KIRK,The Naked Time,Good.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Tormolen's record?
KIRK,The Naked Time,Was he trying to kill himself?
KIRK,The Naked Time,Doesn't sound like the man I know.
KIRK,The Naked Time,What is it?
KIRK,The Naked Time,Compensate.
KIRK,The Naked Time,(adjusts Riley's controls) Compensate.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Uhura, monitor communications."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Tell McCoy I'll be there when I can.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Forcing us to spiral down to maintain the same distance from it.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Engine room from Bridge.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Tie into the helm, Scotty."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"If we should call for power, we'll want it fast."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Then I'll go see what the good doctor wants.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Keep me informed of any change, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"That's a supposition, Doctor, not a fact."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Coincidence?
KIRK,The Naked Time,Maybe.
KIRK,The Naked Time,That's exactly what I was going to ask.
KIRK,The Naked Time,That's not good enough.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Bones, I want the impossible checked out too."
KIRK,The Naked Time,What were their symptoms?
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Irrational, or drugged."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Security, Lieutenant Uhura."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Both Sulu and Riley, locate and confine."
KIRK,The Naked Time,I want every crewman who comes in contact with them medically checked.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Put Security on it.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Present condition of Psi 2000.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Helmsman, stabilise position."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Warp us out of here.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Impulse power then.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Blast us out of this orbit.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Mister Scott, acknowledge."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Our controls are dead.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Take her.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Sulu, put that (discovers that the point is sharp) put that thing away."
KIRK,The Naked Time,I'd like you to teach me that sometime.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Scotty, we need power."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Engine room, acknowledge!"
KIRK,The Naked Time,Who's this?
KIRK,The Naked Time,This is Captain Kirk.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Get out of the engine room, navigator."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Where's Mister Scott?
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Clear that tube, will you?"
KIRK,The Naked Time,And burn up.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"I know, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Naked Time,How did Riley get in there?
KIRK,The Naked Time,He's cut off both helm and power.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Can't you get to the auxiliary?
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Continue the alert, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Cut him off.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Can you tie me in to the Sickbay?
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Riley's the immediate problem, Doctor."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Is there any way, anything you can do to snap him out of it?"
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Please, not again."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Get me Sickbay.
KIRK,The Naked Time,See what you can do to help Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Better check Scotty first.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Move him faster.
KIRK,The Naked Time,He's got to get through that bulkhead.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Get him out of here.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Take the helm.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Take the helm!
KIRK,The Naked Time,At least try cutting him off!
KIRK,The Naked Time,Sorry.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Scotty.
KIRK,The Naked Time,We've got twelve minutes left.
KIRK,The Naked Time,It'll take at least two or three of them to get the engines up to power now.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Call me when you've cut through.
KIRK,The Naked Time,I want to be there.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Naked Time,(to Security) Follow me through.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Put your phasers on stun.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Don't fire unless he's armed.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Go.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Get him out of here.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Scotty, we haven't got much time left."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Naked Time,What is it?
KIRK,The Naked Time,Scotty!
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Scotty, we've got six."
KIRK,The Naked Time,We can balance our engines into a controlled implosion.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Bridge, have you found Mister Spock yet?"
KIRK,The Naked Time,Where have you been?
KIRK,The Naked Time,What happened?
KIRK,The Naked Time,"We've got four minutes, maybe five."
KIRK,The Naked Time,We've got to risk a full-power start.
KIRK,The Naked Time,The engines were shut off.
KIRK,The Naked Time,No time to regenerate them.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Do you hear me?
KIRK,The Naked Time,We've got to risk a full-power start!
KIRK,The Naked Time,(hitting him repeatedly) You've got to hear me!
KIRK,The Naked Time,We need a formula.
KIRK,The Naked Time,We've got to risk implosion!
KIRK,The Naked Time,We've got to risk implosion.
KIRK,The Naked Time,It's our only chance.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Don't tell me that again, Science Officer!"
KIRK,The Naked Time,It's a theory.
KIRK,The Naked Time,It's possible.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"We may go up into the biggest ball of fire since the last sun in these parts exploded, but we've got to take that one in ten thousand chance!"
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Yes, I found Mister Spock!"
KIRK,The Naked Time,"I'm talking to Mister Spock, do you understand?"
KIRK,The Naked Time,"I've got it, the disease."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Love.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"You're better off without it, and I'm better off without mine."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"This vessel, I give, she takes."
KIRK,The Naked Time,She won't permit me my life.
KIRK,The Naked Time,I've got to live hers.
KIRK,The Naked Time,I have a beautiful yeoman.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Have you noticed her, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Naked Time,You're allowed to notice her.
KIRK,The Naked Time,The Captain's not permitted
KIRK,The Naked Time,Now I know why it's called she.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Flesh woman to touch, to hold."
KIRK,The Naked Time,A beach to walk on.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"A few days, no braid on my shoulder."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Scotty, help."
KIRK,The Naked Time,I've got to hang on.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Tell them.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Clear the corridors, the turbo lift."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Hurry.
KIRK,The Naked Time,(Scott and Spock leave) Never lose you.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Never.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Bridge.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Engine room.
KIRK,The Naked Time,We're set.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Hyperbolic course.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Direction.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Direction.
KIRK,The Naked Time,It doesn't matter.
KIRK,The Naked Time,The way we came.
KIRK,The Naked Time,(gazing at Janice) No beach to walk on.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Engage.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Are you?
KIRK,The Naked Time,(Spock nods)
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Checked elapsed time, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Time warp.
KIRK,The Naked Time,We're going backward in time.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Helm, begin reversing power."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Slowly.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Engines ahead.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Warp one.
KIRK,The Naked Time,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Naked Time,The time warp.
KIRK,The Naked Time,What did it do to us?
KIRK,The Naked Time,Not those last three days.
KIRK,The Naked Time,"We may risk it someday, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Naked Time,"Resume course to our next destination, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Naked Time,Steady as she goes.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"Yes, sir."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,Decontaminate.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"Spock and Tormolen aboard, sir."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,We're holding them in the chamber for decontamination.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,Or at least none your tricorders could register.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"Unless you people on the Bridge start taking showers with your clothes on, my engines can pull us out of anything."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,We'll be warping out of orbit within a half second of getting your command.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"Scott here, Captain."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"No problem, sir."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,You'll have it.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"He ran in, said you wanted us on the Bridge."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,And he shut the door behind us and locked off the mechanism.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,I can't.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,He's hooked everything through the main panel in there.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,Get up to my office and pull the plans for this bulkhead.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,The only way to get that door open is to cut through these wall circuits here.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,I've set the jumpers up there.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,Stand by 'til I give you a signal.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,Engineering to Bridge.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,Try your helm.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,You'll have enough power to keep her stabilised.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"Here, let's have a look at that."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,Tell him I'm doing my best.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,If I cut through the wrong circuits
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"Even if we were under a full-scale attack I couldn't move any faster, not and maintain a safety factor."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,Engine room.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"Then we'll make it, sir, if all goes right."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"Almost ready, sir."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"- Ready, sir."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,Captain.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,He's turned the engines off.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,Completely cold.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,It will take thirty minutes to regenerate them.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,I can't change the laws of physics.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,I've got to have thirty minutes.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"Maybe twenty two, twenty three minutes."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"Captain, you can't mix matter and antimatter cold."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,We'd go up in the biggest explosion since
SCOTT,The Naked Time,That's only a theory.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,It's never been done.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"If you wanted to chance odds of ten thousand to one, maybe, assuming we had a row of computers working weeks on the right formula."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"Engineers, man your stations."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"Engine rooms, report."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,"Cycling station, report."
SCOTT,The Naked Time,This will be an emergency restart of engines.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,Captain.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,Level.
SCOTT,The Naked Time,That'll take four minutes.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"You're fine, Joe."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Up and out of there.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Mister Spock?
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Your pulse is two hundred and forty two, your blood pressure is practically nonexistent, assuming you call that green stuff in your veins blood."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"They're fine, Jim."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Oh, thank you, Christine."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Definitely not drugs or intoxication.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,The bio-analysis on the tapes prove that conclusively.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Compensate with the respirator.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Stand by to close.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Closing.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,This shouldn't be happening.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,This man should be getting stronger.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,You sure the respirator's functioning properly?
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Why is this man dying?
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Hypo.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,The wounds were not that severe.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,This is McCoy.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Captain Kirk to Sickbay.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Intestinal damage wasn't that severe.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,I got to him in plenty of time.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,That man should still be alive.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"The only reason he died, Jim, is he didn't want to live."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,He gave up.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Well, that may be."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Maybe.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"I've lost patients before, but not like that."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Not Joe's kind.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,That kind of man doesn't give up.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,You mean that Joe was down on the planet surface and you're gonna ask me if it's connected.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Jim, he was decontaminated."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,He's been medically checked.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,We've run every test we know for everything we know.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Well, we're doing everything that's possible."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Sickbay to Bridge.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"I'm getting you, Jim."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Look, can you keep this beast level?"
MCCOY,The Naked Time,I've got Sulu tranquillized and we're running tests on him.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,So far there's nothing unusual in his bloodstream.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Body functions seem normal.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Negative, until I can get a little farther on these tests."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Biopsy lab.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Biopsy, where's my report?"
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Biopsy, come in!"
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Harrison, where's my report?"
MCCOY,The Naked Time,I'm going to the lab.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Yes?
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Oh, good."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,I'll need him conscious now.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Continue to examine him on circuits K one and three.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,McCoy to Bio.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,We've isolated it.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Start preparing serum.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,It's water.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Somehow on this planet, water's changed to a complex chain of molecules."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,That's how we missed it.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,It passed from man to man through perspiration.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Once in the bloodstream, it acts like alcohol, depresses the centres of judgment, self-control."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Now get someone to the lab.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,"Tell them the serum works, and start preparing more."
MCCOY,The Naked Time,Release him.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,We found a cure.
MCCOY,The Naked Time,We're over that part of it.
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"The lab status report, Doctor."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"His breathing rate is dropping, Doctor."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"Yes, Doctor."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"He's dead, Doctor."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,Well.
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,Yes.
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,I know he was a friend of yours.
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,This must be a terrible shock.
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,Sir?
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,The tranquillizer's wearing off.
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"Of course, Doctor."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,He's gone to the lab.
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,Mister Spock.
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"Mister Spock, (takes his hand) the men from Vulcan treat their women strangely."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"At least, people say that, but you're part human too."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"I know you don't, you couldn't, hurt me, would you?"
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"I'm in love with you, Mister Spock."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"You, the human Mister Spock, the Vulcan Mister Spock."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"Christine, please."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"I see things, how honest you are."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,I know how you feel.
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"You hide it, but you do have feeling."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"Oh, how we must hurt you, torture you."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,The others believe that.
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,I don't.
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,I love you.
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"I don't know why, but I love you."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,I do love you just as you are.
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,"Oh, I love you."
CHAPEL,The Naked Time,Christine.
RAND,The Naked Time,"Spectro-analysis tape, sir."
RAND,The Naked Time,"Yes, sir."
RAND,The Naked Time,"Mister Spock, I'm trying to get to the Bridge and this crewman won't let me by."
RAND,The Naked Time,Spock!
RAND,The Naked Time,"I would have gotten here sooner, sir but Crewman Moody stopped me in the hallway."
RAND,The Naked Time,Sir?
RAND,The Naked Time,"Yes, sir."
RAND,The Naked Time,Sir?
UHURA,The Naked Time,Bridge to Captain.
UHURA,The Naked Time,Scanners report sudden four degree shift in planet magnetic field.
UHURA,The Naked Time,"A change in mass also, sir."
UHURA,The Naked Time,Attention.
UHURA,The Naked Time,Engine room on standby alert.
UHURA,The Naked Time,All duty personnel to the Bridge.
UHURA,The Naked Time,Acknowledge.
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Communications status, Captain."
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Sir, level two, corridor three reports a disturbance."
UHURA,The Naked Time,Mister Sulu chasing crewmen with a sword.
UHURA,The Naked Time,Sulu.
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Sulu, give me that."
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Sorry, neither."
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Mister Spock, a fight in the aft wardroom."
UHURA,The Naked Time,Security reports incidents among the crewmen are increasing.
UHURA,The Naked Time,"All decks, alert system B two."
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Repeat, go to alert condition Baker two."
UHURA,The Naked Time,Seal off all main sections.
UHURA,The Naked Time,Stand by.
UHURA,The Naked Time,"I can't, sir."
UHURA,The Naked Time,He's cut off the alert channels.
UHURA,The Naked Time,"I can't, sir."
UHURA,The Naked Time,There's no way to do it.
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Emergency signal, Captain."
UHURA,The Naked Time,Both decks four and five.
UHURA,The Naked Time,Fights and disorders.
UHURA,The Naked Time,I have no intercom for Sickbay.
UHURA,The Naked Time,He keeps switching channels on me.
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Sir, if I could cut him off, don't you think I"
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,The Naked Time,I'll keep trying.
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Captain is en route to Engineering, Mister Spock."
UHURA,The Naked Time,Can you take the bridge?
UHURA,The Naked Time,Acknowledge.
UHURA,The Naked Time,Bridge to Sickbay.
UHURA,The Naked Time,Is Mister Spock there?
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Mister Spock, would you please acknowledge?"
UHURA,The Naked Time,(Spock is struggling to keep his control)
UHURA,The Naked Time,Bridge to Captain.
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Entering planet's outer atmosphere, sir."
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Ship's outer skin is beginning to heat, Captain."
UHURA,The Naked Time,Orbit plot shows we have about eight minutes left.
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Mister Spock is not on the Bridge, Captain."
UHURA,The Naked Time,Bridge to Captain.
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Engineer asked, did you find"
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Three and a half minutes left, Captain."
UHURA,The Naked Time,"Entering upper stratosphere, Captain."
UHURA,The Naked Time,Skin temperature now twenty one hundred seventy degrees.
SULU,The Naked Time,Foil.
SULU,The Naked Time,It's a rapier.
SULU,The Naked Time,A thin sword.
SULU,The Naked Time,"What do you mean, what do you do with it?"
SULU,The Naked Time,You practice.
SULU,The Naked Time,"Hi, Joey."
SULU,The Naked Time,Your attitude is all wrong.
SULU,The Naked Time,"Fencing tones the muscle, sharpens the eye, improves the posture."
SULU,The Naked Time,"You tell him, Joey."
SULU,The Naked Time,Explain to him.
SULU,The Naked Time,"Hey, Joey."
SULU,The Naked Time,You feeling all right?
SULU,The Naked Time,What's with him?
SULU,The Naked Time,"You sure you're all right now, Joe?"
SULU,The Naked Time,We've got to leave.
SULU,The Naked Time,"Take it easy, Joe."
SULU,The Naked Time,Now calm down.
SULU,The Naked Time,"You're all steamed up, Joe."
SULU,The Naked Time,"What are you doing, Joe?"
SULU,The Naked Time,"Joey, don't be a fool."
SULU,The Naked Time,"Magnetic field continuing to shift, sir."
SULU,The Naked Time,Planet continuing to shrink in mass.
SULU,The Naked Time,"Helm answering nicely, Captain."
SULU,The Naked Time,"Relative gravity increase, sir."
SULU,The Naked Time,Like the planet reached out and yanked at us.
SULU,The Naked Time,Don't know if it's this planet or what happened with Joe.
SULU,The Naked Time,I'm sweating like a bridegroom.
SULU,The Naked Time,"Hey, why don't you come down to the gym with me, Kevin m'lad?"
SULU,The Naked Time,Why not?
SULU,The Naked Time,Light workout will take the edge off.
SULU,The Naked Time,"(brandishing foil) Richelieu, beware!"
SULU,The Naked Time,Stand.
SULU,The Naked Time,No farther.
SULU,The Naked Time,No escape for you.
SULU,The Naked Time,"You either leave this bois bloodied, or with my blood on your swords."
SULU,The Naked Time,Cowards!
SULU,The Naked Time,"Richelieu, at last."
SULU,The Naked Time,"For honour, Queen, and France!"
SULU,The Naked Time,(lunges)
SULU,The Naked Time,Ah.
SULU,The Naked Time,"I'll protect you, fair maiden."
SULU,The Naked Time,Foul Richelieu.
SULU,The Naked Time,"(distracted by Uhura's escape, Kirk is able to grab Sulu and Spock does a neck-pinch)"
SULU,The Naked Time,(waking up screaming) I was on the Bridge.
SULU,The Naked Time,"Hey Doc, what am I doing here?"
SULU,The Naked Time,"Doc, will you let me out of here?"
SULU,The Naked Time,I'm all right.
SULU,The Naked Time,"Course laid in, sir."
SULU,The Naked Time,"Captain, my velocity gauge is off the scale."
SULU,The Naked Time,"My chronometer's running backwards, sir."
SULU,The Naked Time,"Helm answering, sir."
SULU,The Naked Time,Power reversing.
SULU,The Naked Time,"Warp one, sir."
SULU,The Naked Time,"Course laid in, sir."
RILEY,The Naked Time,All right.
RILEY,The Naked Time,So what do you do with it?
RILEY,The Naked Time,Self-defence?
RILEY,The Naked Time,Mayhem?
RILEY,The Naked Time,Shish kebab?
RILEY,The Naked Time,For what?
RILEY,The Naked Time,Last week it was botany he was trying to get me interested in.
RILEY,The Naked Time,"I was supposed to be collecting leaves, plant specimens."
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Take it easy, Joe."
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Hey, Joey, put the knife down, huh?"
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Hey, Joey, put the knife down."
RILEY,The Naked Time,(grabs his arm) Don't be a fool.
RILEY,The Naked Time,You're just getting in a sweat about (three men struggle) Let me have the knife!
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Joey, give me the knife."
RILEY,The Naked Time,"(they fall to the floor, Tormolen gets stabbed in the stomach) Emergency!"
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Rec room, area three nine."
RILEY,The Naked Time,We need medics!
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Relative gravity increasing, sir."
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Yes, sir."
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Orbit steady now, sir."
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Orbit steady now, sir."
RILEY,The Naked Time,"May be a little nervous, I guess."
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Yeah, me too."
RILEY,The Naked Time,Now?
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Sulu, what about."
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Hey, Sulu, don't be a fool!"
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Magnetic pull compensated for, sir."
RILEY,The Naked Time,Orbit steady.
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Have no fear, O'Riley's here."
RILEY,The Naked Time,One Irishman is worth ten thousand of you
RILEY,The Naked Time,Now that's what I like.
RILEY,The Naked Time,Let the women work too.
RILEY,The Naked Time,Universal suffrage.
RILEY,The Naked Time,Sickbay?
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Exactly where I was heading, sir."
RILEY,The Naked Time,Where's Joe?
RILEY,The Naked Time,"He died, didn't he."
RILEY,The Naked Time,You know something?
RILEY,The Naked Time,"You have such lovely eyes, pretty lady."
RILEY,The Naked Time,(touches her face)
RILEY,The Naked Time,You know what Joe's mistake was?
RILEY,The Naked Time,He wasn't born an Irishman.
RILEY,The Naked Time,"You rang, sir?"
RILEY,The Naked Time,This is Captain Kevin Thomas Riley of the starship Enterprise.
RILEY,The Naked Time,And who is this?
RILEY,The Naked Time,I've relieved Mister Scott of his duties.
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Now, attention, cooks."
RILEY,The Naked Time,This is your captain speaking.
RILEY,The Naked Time,I would like double portions of ice cream for the entire crew.
RILEY,The Naked Time,"And now, your captain will render an ancient Irish favourite."
RILEY,The Naked Time,(sings) I'll take you home again Kathleen
RILEY,The Naked Time,Wild and wide to where your heart
RILEY,The Naked Time,(singing) The roses all have left your cheeks.
RILEY,The Naked Time,I've watched them fade away and die
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Lieutenant Uhura,"
RILEY,The Naked Time,You've interrupted my song.
RILEY,The Naked Time,"I'm sorry, but there'll be no ice cream for you tonight."
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Attention, crew."
RILEY,The Naked Time,This is Captain Riley.
RILEY,The Naked Time,There will be a formal dance in the bowling alley at nineteen hundred hours tonight.
RILEY,The Naked Time,This is Captain Riley.
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Crew, I have some additional orders."
RILEY,The Naked Time,"In the future, all female crew members will wear their hair loosely, about their shoulders."
RILEY,The Naked Time,And use restraint in putting on your makeup.
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Women, women should not look made up."
RILEY,The Naked Time,"And now, crew, I will render Kathleen one more time!"
RILEY,The Naked Time,"(singing) I'll take you home again, Kathleen (meanwhile, Scott is working in a Jefferies tube) I've watched them fade away and die."
RILEY,The Naked Time,And tears bedim your loving eyes.
RILEY,The Naked Time,"Oh,"
RILEY,The Naked Time,I will take you home Kathleen.
RILEY,The Naked Time,Kathleen.
RILEY,The Naked Time,"And now, crew, one more time!"
RILEY,The Naked Time,I'll take you home again Kathleen
RILEY,The Naked Time,Across the ocean wild and wide
RILEY,The Naked Time,I will take you home Kathleen
RILEY,The Naked Time,To where your heart will feel no pain.
RILEY,The Naked Time,When the fields are fresh and green.
RILEY,The Naked Time,I'll take you to your home
RILEY,The Naked Time,I'll take.
RILEY,The Naked Time,No dance tonight.
BRENT,The Naked Time,"Yes, sir."
BRENT,The Naked Time,Helm is not answering to control.
BRENT,The Naked Time,"No response from engines, sir."
BRENT,The Naked Time,"Impulse engines also dead, sir."
BRENT,The Naked Time,"Direction, sir?"
MOODY,The Naked Time,(singing) I'll take you home again Janice
MOODY,The Naked Time,"Oh, yes, sir."
MOODY,The Naked Time,"I'll take you home again, Janice"
HARRISON,The Naked Time,"What, Doctor?"
HARRISON,The Naked Time,"What's that, Doctor?"
KIRK,Charlie X,"All right, Chief, begin materialisation."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Captain Ramart, I'm Captain Kirk."
KIRK,Charlie X,How do you do?
KIRK,Charlie X,Mister Evans.
KIRK,Charlie X,We've heard a great deal about you.
KIRK,Charlie X,Welcome aboard.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Four hundred and twenty eight, to be exact."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Is there anything we can do for you, Captain?"
KIRK,Charlie X,"Medical supplies, provisions?"
KIRK,Charlie X,"You keep interrupting, Mister Evans."
KIRK,Charlie X,That's considered wrong.
KIRK,Charlie X,"We have a large supply of entertainment tapes, gentlemen."
KIRK,Charlie X,This must be a space first.
KIRK,Charlie X,A transport ship that doesn't need anything?
KIRK,Charlie X,Not even Sarian brandy?
KIRK,Charlie X,Thank you.
KIRK,Charlie X,(the pair are beamed off)
KIRK,Charlie X,"Yeoman Rand, this is Charles Evans."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Show him to his quarters and drop his records off at Doctor McCoy's office, if you will."
KIRK,Charlie X,That's a girl.
KIRK,Charlie X,Good.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock is working out"
KIRK,Charlie X,Thank you.
KIRK,Charlie X,He's working out a training programme for Charlie Evans.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Earth history, his own background, that sort of thing."
KIRK,Charlie X,"I'd like you to give him the necessary medical orientation on the problems of, um, er, adolescence."
KIRK,Charlie X,"The job is yours, Bones."
KIRK,Charlie X,Flattery will get you nowhere.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Do you believe the legend, Mister Spock, that Thasians still exist on that planet in some form?"
KIRK,Charlie X,"Gentlemen, the fact is the boy is here and he's alive and he needs our help."
KIRK,Charlie X,Hmm.
KIRK,Charlie X,"I'll depend on your astute abilities to supply him with that, or find him one."
KIRK,Charlie X,"On Earth today, it's Thanksgiving."
KIRK,Charlie X,"If the crew has to eat synthetic meat loaf, I want it to look like turkey."
KIRK,Charlie X,Charlie.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Say it right out, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,That usually works.
KIRK,Charlie X,Me.
KIRK,Charlie X,I see.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Well, um, er, there are things you can do with a lady, er, Charlie, that you er."
KIRK,Charlie X,There's no right way to hit a woman.
KIRK,Charlie X,"I mean, man to man is one thing, but, er, man and woman, er, it's, er, it's, er."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Well it's, er, another thing."
KIRK,Charlie X,Do you understand?
KIRK,Charlie X,Excuse me.
KIRK,Charlie X,Kirk here.
KIRK,Charlie X,I'm on my way to the Bridge now.
KIRK,Charlie X,"I don't think so, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,Okay.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Kirk here, Captain Ramart."
KIRK,Charlie X,Re-establish contact.
KIRK,Charlie X,Keep trying.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Sweep the area of the Antares transmission with our probe scanners, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Charlie X,"You think something happened to the Antares, Charlie?"
KIRK,Charlie X,What about the Antares?
KIRK,Charlie X,Kirk here.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Chief, have you been"
KIRK,Charlie X,A survey ship with twenty men aboard lost.
KIRK,Charlie X,No reason.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Obviously, Captain Ramart was not aware of any trouble."
KIRK,Charlie X,I can't figure it.
KIRK,Charlie X,"I can usually follow you, Mister Spock, but this time?"
KIRK,Charlie X,"I'd call it a pretty long reach for evidence, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Come in, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,Checkmate.
KIRK,Charlie X,I prefer to call it inspired.
KIRK,Charlie X,"You play chess, Charlie?"
KIRK,Charlie X,I place you in the hands of our chess master.
KIRK,Charlie X,What?
KIRK,Charlie X,Charlie's a seventeen year old boy.
KIRK,Charlie X,I talked to him about the swat.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Yes, Yeoman, I'll talk to him."
KIRK,Charlie X,I'll look into it.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Come in, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Er, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Charlie, do you know anything about this chess piece?"
KIRK,Charlie X,Did you notice anything peculiar in them when we were using them this afternoon?
KIRK,Charlie X,"Er, no."
KIRK,Charlie X,"No, no."
KIRK,Charlie X,Sit down.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Charlie, being seventeen is more than how many years you've lived."
KIRK,Charlie X,It's a whole other thing.
KIRK,Charlie X,Doctor McCoy could probably explain the biological conditions.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Well, let's, let's use a specific."
KIRK,Charlie X,Yeoman Rand is a woman.
KIRK,Charlie X,"No, there's more to it than that."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Now wait, wait."
KIRK,Charlie X,"You'll live, believe me."
KIRK,Charlie X,There's nothing wrong with you that hasn't gone wrong with every other human male since the model first came up.
KIRK,Charlie X,You go slow.
KIRK,Charlie X,You be gentle.
KIRK,Charlie X,"I mean, it's not a one-way street, you know, how you feel and that's all."
KIRK,Charlie X,"It's how the girl feels, too."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Don't press, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,"If the girl feels anything for you at all, you'll know it."
KIRK,Charlie X,Do you understand?
KIRK,Charlie X,"She's not the girl, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,"The years are wrong, for one thing, and there are other things."
KIRK,Charlie X,"No, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,No.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Charlie, there are a million things in this universe you can have and there are a million things you can't have."
KIRK,Charlie X,"It's no fun facing that, but that's the way things are."
KIRK,Charlie X,Hang on tight and survive.
KIRK,Charlie X,Everybody does.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Everybody, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Me, too."
KIRK,Charlie X,Kirk here.
KIRK,Charlie X,Ask Mister Spock to see to it.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Charlie, come on with me."
KIRK,Charlie X,You've got to slap the floor to absorb the energy when you fall.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Go ahead, try it."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Like everything else, it takes practice, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,Try again.
KIRK,Charlie X,Good.
KIRK,Charlie X,That's much better.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Here, now I'll show you a shoulder roll."
KIRK,Charlie X,Try that.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Well, it makes it hard to teach you"
KIRK,Charlie X,"All right, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,Lesson's over for today.
KIRK,Charlie X,You have to learn to protect yourself in a fall before I do that.
KIRK,Charlie X,It's more than teaching you to defend yourself.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Charlie, I want you to learn."
KIRK,Charlie X,Charlie?
KIRK,Charlie X,"Hey, Sam, let me borrow you for a couple easy throws, all right?"
KIRK,Charlie X,"Watch this, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,"That wasn't so bad, was it?"
KIRK,Charlie X,Now I'll throw him.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Here we go, Sam."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Come on, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,Try it.
KIRK,Charlie X,Attaboy.
KIRK,Charlie X,Let's go.
KIRK,Charlie X,"That wasn't so bad, was it?"
KIRK,Charlie X,Cool off.
KIRK,Charlie X,Charlie.
KIRK,Charlie X,"What happened to him, Charlie?"
KIRK,Charlie X,That's no answer.
KIRK,Charlie X,Kirk here.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Two men from security, on the double."
KIRK,Charlie X,I'm confining you to quarters.
KIRK,Charlie X,I want you to stay there.
KIRK,Charlie X,"They won't hurt you, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,"(security arrive) They'll take you to your quarters, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,Go with them.
KIRK,Charlie X,Go to your quarters.
KIRK,Charlie X,Go to your quarters or I'll pick you up and carry you there.
KIRK,Charlie X,"That's your choice, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,They won't hurt you.
KIRK,Charlie X,Kirk here.
KIRK,Charlie X,"No, I heard you."
KIRK,Charlie X,Have Doctor McCoy and Mister Spock meet me in the Briefing room.
KIRK,Charlie X,"What are chances that Charlie's not an Earthling, that he's a Thasian?"
KIRK,Charlie X,"Well, whatever he is, we have some idea of the power he has."
KIRK,Charlie X,I know what I saw him do in the gymnasium.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Short-tempered, because he doesn't understand."
KIRK,Charlie X,"He needs, he wants."
KIRK,Charlie X,Nothing happens fast enough.
KIRK,Charlie X,He doesn't understand what life is.
KIRK,Charlie X,He's a boy.
KIRK,Charlie X,"It goes even further than that, Doctor."
KIRK,Charlie X,We can't take him with us to Earth Colony Five.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Can you imagine what he'd do in an open, normal environment."
KIRK,Charlie X,"I've talked with him, listened."
KIRK,Charlie X,"He's a boy in a man's body, trying to be an adult with the adolescence in him getting in the way."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Are you responsible for what happened to the Antares, Charlie?"
KIRK,Charlie X,Answer me.
KIRK,Charlie X,"What about us, Charlie?"
KIRK,Charlie X,"Lieutenant, raise Colony Five."
KIRK,Charlie X,I want to speak directly to the governor.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Navigator, lay a course away from Colony Five."
KIRK,Charlie X,Buy me some time.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Spock, get the doctor up here on the double."
KIRK,Charlie X,How bad is it?
KIRK,Charlie X,"Mister Spock, you getting any readings on your instruments?"
KIRK,Charlie X,Mister Spock.
KIRK,Charlie X,Release the transmitter.
KIRK,Charlie X,"See to her, Doctor."
KIRK,Charlie X,"That's enough, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,Leave my crew alone.
KIRK,Charlie X,(Charlie leaves)
KIRK,Charlie X,I know.
KIRK,Charlie X,Spock.
KIRK,Charlie X,Mister Spock?
KIRK,Charlie X,"Let him go, too, Charlie."
KIRK,Charlie X,Because I'm telling you to.
KIRK,Charlie X,"Because you need me to run the ship, and I need him."
KIRK,Charlie X,And what about Yeoman Janice?
KIRK,Charlie X,Is she dead?
KIRK,Charlie X,Gone?
KIRK,Charlie X,Destroyed?
KIRK,Charlie X,"Are you creating that message, Charlie, or you're blocking one that's coming in."
KIRK,Charlie X,I've waited long enough.
KIRK,Charlie X,I'm going to take him on.
KIRK,Charlie X,Mister Spock?
KIRK,Charlie X,Wait a minute.
KIRK,Charlie X,Does Charlie?
KIRK,Charlie X,"Now, wait, Spock, has he done away with anybody since he took over?"
KIRK,Charlie X,Maybe he can't.
KIRK,Charlie X,Could be he's overreached himself.
KIRK,Charlie X,It's a big ship.
KIRK,Charlie X,He's taken full control.
KIRK,Charlie X,"If we could tax his power, turn on every device on the ship, every circuit, every light, all of it, and while he's fighting that, if I could distract him, maybe you could tranquilize him, keep him under until we reach Colony Five."
KIRK,Charlie X,"If we don't try, Doctor, he'll get rid of us anyway."
KIRK,Charlie X,"There's no choice, gentlemen, none at all."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Get out of my chair, Charlie, and get out of it now."
KIRK,Charlie X,"Maybe, Charlie, but I don't think you can handle any more."
KIRK,Charlie X,"I think you've reached your limit and can't take on one more thing, but you're going to have to."
KIRK,Charlie X,You're going to have to take me on.
KIRK,Charlie X,"You've got my ship, and I want it back."
KIRK,Charlie X,"I want my crew back, whole, if I have to break your neck to do it!"
KIRK,Charlie X,(throws him out of command chair)
KIRK,Charlie X,"It's all right, Yeoman."
KIRK,Charlie X,The boy belongs with his own kind.
KIRK,Charlie X,"With training, we can teach him to live in our society."
KIRK,Charlie X,If he can be taught not to use his power
KIRK,Charlie X,Is there nothing you can do?
KIRK,Charlie X,"It's all right, Yeoman."
KIRK,Charlie X,It's all over now.
RAMART,Charlie X,This is my navigator Tom Nellis.
RAMART,Charlie X,"And this is our young castaway Charlie, Charlie Evans."
RAMART,Charlie X,His dossier.
RAMART,Charlie X,"Wonderful boy, Charlie."
RAMART,Charlie X,Its been an honour having him aboard.
RAMART,Charlie X,Absolutely.
RAMART,Charlie X,To think this boy spent practically his whole life alone on that planet.
RAMART,Charlie X,"Everyone killed, just a few microtapes to learn from."
RAMART,Charlie X,"Like a whole city in space, Charlie."
RAMART,Charlie X,"Over four hundred in the crew of a starship, aren't there, Captain?"
RAMART,Charlie X,You see.
RAMART,Charlie X,"We'd like to keep Charlie with us, but with his closest living relatives on Colony Five and your vessel going that way, why"
RAMART,Charlie X,"No, we've a tight schedule to make, Captain."
RAMART,Charlie X,"Just twenty of us, we're making out fine."
RAMART,Charlie X,Nothing.
RAMART,Charlie X,"We're fine, thank you."
RAMART,Charlie X,"Pleasant journey, Captain."
RAMART,Charlie X,"We're at full output, Enterprise."
RAMART,Charlie X,I must speak to Captain Kirk.
RAMART,Charlie X,"Captain, we're just barely in range."
RAMART,Charlie X,I've got to warn
NELLIS,Charlie X,How do you do?
NELLIS,Charlie X,"Why, it's been a great pleasure."
NELLIS,Charlie X,The things that he's learned in the last
NELLIS,Charlie X,That's perfect.
NELLIS,Charlie X,It's the exact word.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,How many humans like me on this ship?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Hundreds.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"All human, like me."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,That's exciting.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Is that the right word?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I'd like to see your ship now.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,All of it.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,The people and everything.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I'm sorry.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Are you a girl?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Is that a girl?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"After that I found other things to eat, just growing around."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,The memory banks still worked.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"They talked to me, and I talked back."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Four?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"That, that Captain."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Kirk?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Why does he call me Mister Evans?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"He's not, well, he isn't like Captain Ramart."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Do you like me?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Some, the other ship, they didn't like me."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I tried.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I'm trying to make people like me.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I want them to like me.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I brought you a present.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Do you like that kind?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,It's a present.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Can't you stay and talk a little while?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"You got a deal, friend."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,(slaps her bottom)
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I thought.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Don't be angry.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"I didn't, I wanted."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Don't be angry.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I will.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Want to see something?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,(puts three cards face down) Turn them over.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,(They have pictures of Rand on them)
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Oh, I can do a lot of card tricks."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,One of the men on the Antares showed me.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Captain?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I'm supposed to ask you something.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Why shouldn't I?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I don't know how to explain it.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Well, in the corridor I saw."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"When Janice, when Yeoman Rand was."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,(slaps Kirk's bottom) I did that to her.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,She didn't like it.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,She said you'd explain it to me.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I don't know.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Can I come with you?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I won't get in the way.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,It wasn't very well constructed.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I don't know.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Oh, I, I watched them play on the Antares."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Can I try?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I know what it is.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Let's play.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"No, it wasn't."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"No, it isn't."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Can I talk to you, alone."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,But I don't need her.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I want to talk to you.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,But she's not as.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,She doesn't.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,She's not the same.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Not like you.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"She's, she's just a girl."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"You're, you smell like a girl."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"All the other girls on the ship they, they look just like Tina."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You're the only one who looks like you.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"You can understand, can't you?"
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You know about being with somebody?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Wanting to be?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,If I had the whole universe I'd give it to you.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"When I see you, I feel like I'm hungry all over."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Hungry.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Do you know how that feels?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"No, sir."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Is that all?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Oh, I won't hit her like that anymore."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Everything I do or say is wrong.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"I'm in the way, I don't know the rules, and when I learn something and try to do it, suddenly I'm wrong!"
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"I don't know what I am or what I'm supposed to be, or even who."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I don't know why I hurt so much inside all the time.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,What if you care for someone?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,What do you do?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You don't think Janice.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,She could love me!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,She can.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,She is.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,But if I did what you said!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,If I was gentle!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Then what am I going to do?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You don't.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"I'm trying, but I don't know how."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I don't want to do that.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I don't want to do that.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You were going to teach me how to fight.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,That looks hard.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Oh!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Don't laugh at me.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Don't laugh at me!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,He shouldn't have done that.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,It's not nice to laugh at people.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,He's gone.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,He's gone!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I didn't mean to do that.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,He made me do it!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,He laughed at me.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,What are you going to do to me?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I won't let them hurt me.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"I'll make them go away, too."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,No!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,(phaser disappears)
CHARLIE,Charlie X,He was going to hurt me.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I won't let you.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I won't let them hurt me.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"You wanted to ask me something, he said."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Why?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Yes.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,There was a warped baffle-plate on the shield of their energy pile.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I made it go away.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,It would've blown up anyway.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Well they weren't nice to me!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,They wanted to get rid of me.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,They don't now.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I don't know.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"You're trying to change course, Captain."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You can't do that.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I want to get to Colony Five as soon as we can.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You don't need all that subspace chatter.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Very nice, Mister Ears."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Oh, I can make him do anything, whirl around, laugh, anything."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Don't you think he's funny?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I think he's funny.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I have something for you.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"(a rose) Pink is your favourite, isn't it?"
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Don't ever lock your door on me again, Janice."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I love you.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I only want to be nice to you.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I can give you anything.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Just, just tell me."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,But I only want to be nice to you.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I love you.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Then show me.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Why did she do that?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"I loved her, but she wasn't nice at all."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"What you did wasn't nice either, but I still need you, Captain."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,The Enterprise isn't quite like the Antares.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Running the Antares was easy.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You have to be nice.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,All right?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,(gives pain)
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Why?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"If you try to hurt me again, I'll make a lot of people go away."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I won't tell you.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Growing up isn't so much.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"I'm not a man, and I can do anything!"
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You can't.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,He had a mean look.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I had to freeze him.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I like happy looks.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,(enters room) Aren't you coming in?
CHARLIE,Charlie X,That wasn't nice.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You'll be sorry.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"You wait, you'll see, you'll be sorry you did that."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,(unfreezes them) You will.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,No.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,No laughing!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"It's my game, Captain."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You have to find out.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Like you said, that's how the game's played."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You can have it now.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I've locked on course for Colony Five again.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,(leaves)
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I can make you all go away anytime I want to.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"I've got your ship, Captain."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"I could've sent you away before, but I didn't."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Don't make me do it now.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Don't push me.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,(gives Kirk pain) Sorry.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I'm sorry but.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Stop it.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I said stop it!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Oh.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,No!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Oh, no, please, don't let them take me."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I can't live with them anymore.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,You're my friends.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"You said you were my friends, remember?"
CHARLIE,Charlie X,When I came aboard!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Please, I want to go home."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Take me home.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I won't do it again.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Please, I'll be good."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I won't ever do it again.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I'm sorry about the Antares.
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I'm sorry!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,When I came aboard!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Please, I want to go with you."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Help me!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Oh, please, don't let them take me."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,I can't even touch them!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Janice, they can't feel."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,Not like you!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,They don't love!
CHARLIE,Charlie X,"Please, I want to stay."
CHARLIE,Charlie X,(fades away)
RAND,Charlie X,"Yes, sir."
RAND,Charlie X,"Come with me, please."
RAND,Charlie X,"Oh, thank you."
RAND,Charlie X,"I really appreciate it, but, but I have to go."
RAND,Charlie X,I'm on duty.
RAND,Charlie X,"Yes, I, it's my favourite."
RAND,Charlie X,Where did you get it?
RAND,Charlie X,They don't have any in the ship's stores.
RAND,Charlie X,"I know, but where did?"
RAND,Charlie X,"Gee, I'm late, Charlie."
RAND,Charlie X,I really have to go.
RAND,Charlie X,"Look, I'm off duty at fourteen hundred."
RAND,Charlie X,"Why don't you join me in recreation room six, deck three."
RAND,Charlie X,Charlie!
RAND,Charlie X,"Charlie, you, you, you just don't go around slapping girls on the."
RAND,Charlie X,"It's okay, but er, just don't do it again."
RAND,Charlie X,"Look, why don't you tell Captain Kirk or Doctor McCoy what you did."
RAND,Charlie X,They'll explain it to you.
RAND,Charlie X,Okay?
RAND,Charlie X,Okay.
RAND,Charlie X,One more time!
RAND,Charlie X,"Well, how did you do that?"
RAND,Charlie X,I don't believe this!
RAND,Charlie X,"Oh, Charlie."
RAND,Charlie X,I was looking for you.
RAND,Charlie X,"I'd like you to meet Tina Lawton, Yeoman Third Class."
RAND,Charlie X,Charlie Evans.
RAND,Charlie X,I thought you might enjoy meeting someone your own age.
RAND,Charlie X,"Charlie, Tina's"
RAND,Charlie X,"That was, that was rude and completely uncalled-for."
RAND,Charlie X,That's no excuse.
RAND,Charlie X,You'd better learn that right now.
RAND,Charlie X,"You have to live with people, Charlie."
RAND,Charlie X,You're not alone anymore.
RAND,Charlie X,"I wasn't sure I should, er, talk to you about this."
RAND,Charlie X,"Exactly, and he's"
RAND,Charlie X,It's not that.
RAND,Charlie X,"Captain, I've seen the look before, and if something isn't done, sooner or later I'm going to have to hurt him."
RAND,Charlie X,"Tell him to leave me alone, and that wouldn't be good for him right now."
RAND,Charlie X,"You see, I'm his first crush, his first love, and his first"
RAND,Charlie X,"Thank you, sir."
RAND,Charlie X,You don't walk into a room without knocking.
RAND,Charlie X,I'll lock it when I please.
RAND,Charlie X,"What is it you want, anyway?"
RAND,Charlie X,(switching on comm.)
RAND,Charlie X,I want you to get out.
RAND,Charlie X,"Get out, Charlie."
RAND,Charlie X,I can't make it any plainer than that.
RAND,Charlie X,You don't know what the word means.
RAND,Charlie X,No!
RAND,Charlie X,Charlie!
RAND,Charlie X,"Captain, how did I?"
MCCOY,Charlie X,Tell me.
MCCOY,Charlie X,The ship's supply of food concentrates couldn't have lasted fourteen years.
MCCOY,Charlie X,And you learned to talk by just listening to the ship's tapes?
MCCOY,Charlie X,You're four-oh.
MCCOY,Charlie X,Four-oh.
MCCOY,Charlie X,One hundred percent.
MCCOY,Charlie X,Sound of wind and limb.
MCCOY,Charlie X,Yeah.
MCCOY,Charlie X,Because that's your name.
MCCOY,Charlie X,"Well, no."
MCCOY,Charlie X,"Captain Kirk is one of a kind, Charlie."
MCCOY,Charlie X,Why not?
MCCOY,Charlie X,Most seventeen year olds do.
MCCOY,Charlie X,"Come on, let's go."
MCCOY,Charlie X,I'll show you to your quarters.
MCCOY,Charlie X,"But tell me, what reason would he have to lie if there are Thasians?"
MCCOY,Charlie X,"Well, don't you think it'd be better for a strong father image like you?"
MCCOY,Charlie X,He already looks up to you.
MCCOY,Charlie X,"By which time he would have been eating fruits, vegetables."
MCCOY,Charlie X,"And probes have been known to be wrong, Spock."
MCCOY,Charlie X,"Doctor, are you speaking scientifically or emotionally?"
MCCOY,Charlie X,"And he needs a guide and he needs a father image, Jim."
MCCOY,Charlie X,"No, I don't think so, not unless they're exactly like Earthlings."
MCCOY,Charlie X,The development of his fingers and toes exactly matches the present development of mans on Earth.
MCCOY,Charlie X,"Considering the effect a normal adolescent has on a home, Charlie with the power he has"
MCCOY,Charlie X,"Well, what do we do with this boy, Jim?"
MCCOY,Charlie X,How do we keep him caged up?
MCCOY,Charlie X,"Well, for the moment he's stopped."
MCCOY,Charlie X,"You're an authority he respects, Jim."
MCCOY,Charlie X,What's going on here?
MCCOY,Charlie X,Spock calls me to the Bridge and goes into some kind of poetry.
MCCOY,Charlie X,You don't have any special immunity.
MCCOY,Charlie X,Not anymore.
MCCOY,Charlie X,"Pushed far enough, he'd send you off to oblivion, too."
MCCOY,Charlie X,"Risky, Jim."
SPOCK,Charlie X,That is a very intriguing question.
SPOCK,Charlie X,"Scanners show no disturbances in this quadrant, Captain."
SPOCK,Charlie X,"Doctor, didn't the boy make any reference at all to Thasians?"
SPOCK,Charlie X,Charlie's very existence proves in fact there must be some intelligent form of life on Thasus.
SPOCK,Charlie X,He could not possibly have survived alone.
SPOCK,Charlie X,The ship's food concentrates would have been exhausted in a year or so.
SPOCK,Charlie X,Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant life.
SPOCK,Charlie X,"Affirmative, Captain."
SPOCK,Charlie X,"Picking up some debris on our scanners, Captain."
SPOCK,Charlie X,The debris is what's left of the Antares.
SPOCK,Charlie X,"Your mind is not on the game, Captain."
SPOCK,Charlie X,Check.
SPOCK,Charlie X,The Antares?
SPOCK,Charlie X,My own concern is more immediate.
SPOCK,Charlie X,The boy.
SPOCK,Charlie X,He seemed to know what happened to the Antares before we did.
SPOCK,Charlie X,"And again, check."
SPOCK,Charlie X,"Your illogical approach to chess does have its advantages on occasion, Captain."
SPOCK,Charlie X,As you wish.
SPOCK,Charlie X,"At any rate, the game is yours."
SPOCK,Charlie X,"The principles of three-dimensional chess are basically mathematic, Charlie."
SPOCK,Charlie X,You put the white here and the black on the secondary level.
SPOCK,Charlie X,Very well.
SPOCK,Charlie X,"(just three moves later) That was a mistake, Charlie."
SPOCK,Charlie X,Checkmate.
SPOCK,Charlie X,If you'll excuse me.
SPOCK,Charlie X,Thasians have been referred to in our records as having the power to transmute objects or render substances invisible.
SPOCK,Charlie X,"It has generally been regarded as legend, but Charlie does seems to possess this same power."
SPOCK,Charlie X,Agreed.
SPOCK,Charlie X,"The probability is he's responsible for the destruction of the Antares, which would indicate a total disregard for human life."
SPOCK,Charlie X,"And with a weapon in him which could destroy you or anyone, anywhere on this ship."
SPOCK,Charlie X,Agreed.
SPOCK,Charlie X,The struggle must remain between you and him.
SPOCK,Charlie X,Should any of us interfere
SPOCK,Charlie X,We're in the hands of an adolescent.
SPOCK,Charlie X,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,Charlie X,"There's a Tyger, tyger, burning bright in the forest of the night."
SPOCK,Charlie X,"I'm trying to Saturn rings around my head, down a road that's Martian red."
SPOCK,Charlie X,"Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered, weak and weary."
SPOCK,Charlie X,"Jim, he'll soon reach a point where he won't back down."
SPOCK,Charlie X,My legs.
SPOCK,Charlie X,They're broken.
SPOCK,Charlie X,I'll activate the force field myself.
SPOCK,Charlie X,You can return to your section.
SPOCK,Charlie X,Out of the question.
SPOCK,Charlie X,Not so far as we know.
SPOCK,Charlie X,"Captain, the navigation console is clear now."
SPOCK,Charlie X,The ship is answering the helm.
SPOCK,Charlie X,"Sensors show there something's there, Captain."
SPOCK,Charlie X,Deflectors indicate no solid substance.
UHURA,Charlie X,"Excuse me, Captain."
UHURA,Charlie X,Status report.
UHURA,Charlie X,I'm sorry.
UHURA,Charlie X,"I did it again, didn't I."
UHURA,Charlie X,"(singing) Oh, on the starship Enterprise There's someone who's in Satan's guise Whose devil ears and devil eyes Could rip your heart from you."
UHURA,Charlie X,"At first, his look could hypnotise And then his touch would barbarise His alien love could victimise And rip your heart from you."
UHURA,Charlie X,"And that's why female astronauts, Oh, very female astronauts Wait terrified and overwrought To find what he will do."
UHURA,Charlie X,"Oh, girls in space, be wary, be wary, be wary, Girls in space, be wary."
UHURA,Charlie X,We know not what he'll do.
UHURA,Charlie X,"(singing) Now from a planet out in space, there comes a lad, not commonplace."
UHURA,Charlie X,A-seeking out his first embrace.
UHURA,Charlie X,He's saving it for you.
UHURA,Charlie X,"Oh, Charlie's our new darling, our darling, our darling."
UHURA,Charlie X,Charlie's our new darling.
UHURA,Charlie X,We know not what he'll do.
UHURA,Charlie X,Captain Kirk.
UHURA,Charlie X,Captain Ramart of the Antares is on D channel.
UHURA,Charlie X,"Can you boost your power, Antares."
UHURA,Charlie X,We're barely reading your transmission.
UHURA,Charlie X,They're not transmitting.
UHURA,Charlie X,"You asked to be notified when we were to make our course adjustments, sir."
UHURA,Charlie X,Captain Kirk.
UHURA,Charlie X,Security reports that all phaser weapons have disappeared.
UHURA,Charlie X,"Shall I repeat, Captain?"
UHURA,Charlie X,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,Charlie X,"I think it's all right, sir."
UHURA,Charlie X,"Sir, there's no reason for that panel to cross-circuit like that."
UHURA,Charlie X,I checked it over myself not fifteen minutes ago.
UHURA,Charlie X,"Captain Kirk, my instruments show we're receiving a message on subspace frequency three, ship-to-ship."
UHURA,Charlie X,"I can't hear it, sir."
UHURA,Charlie X,"Sir, something off our starboard bow."
UHURA,Charlie X,The message says they're from Thasus.
UHURA,Charlie X,"Charlie's back on board the Thasian ship, sir."
UHURA,Charlie X,They signal they're leaving.
CHEF,Charlie X,Captain Kirk from ship's Galley.
CHEF,Charlie X,"Sir, I put meat loaf in the ovens."
CHEF,Charlie X,There's turkeys in there now.
CHEF,Charlie X,Real turkeys.
TINA,Charlie X,"Hello, Charlie."
TINA,Charlie X,Excuse me.
TINA,Charlie X,I must be wanted somewhere.
TINA,Charlie X,"Charlie, what's wrong?"
TINA,Charlie X,(he turns her into an iguana)
SAM,Charlie X,Right.
SAM,Charlie X,Oh.
CREWMAN,Charlie X,Bridge.
CREWMAN,Charlie X,Affirmative.
NAVIGATOR,Charlie X,"Yes, sir."
NAVIGATOR,Charlie X,Captain!
NAVIGATOR,Charlie X,"I can't feed any course co-ordinates into the panel, sir."
NAVIGATOR,Charlie X,It rejects the course change.
PILOT,Charlie X,"Helm doesn't respond either, sir."
PILOT,Charlie X,(Charlie enters)
THASIAN,Charlie X,"I have taken my form from centuries ago, so that I may communicate with you."
THASIAN,Charlie X,"We did not realise until too late that the boy had gone, and we are saddened that his escape cost the lives of the first ship."
THASIAN,Charlie X,"We could not help them, but we have returned your people and your ship to you."
THASIAN,Charlie X,Everything is as it was.
THASIAN,Charlie X,That would be impossible.
THASIAN,Charlie X,We gave him the power so he could live.
THASIAN,Charlie X,"He will use it, always, and he would destroy you and your kind, or you would be forced to destroy him to save yourselves."
THASIAN,Charlie X,"We offer him life, and we will take care of him."
THASIAN,Charlie X,"Come, Charles."

SCOTT,"Balance

SCOTT,"Balance

SCOTT,"Balance

SCOTT,"Balance

SCOTT,"Balance

SCOTT,"Balance

SCOTT,"Balance

standby crew available."
KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Did Outpost 4 give anything at all on the attacking vessel,
Lieutenant?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Mister Spock, put this star sector on our screen."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Now show our
position."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Signal this to all decks, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",This is the Captain speaking.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","In our
next action, we can risk neither miscalculation nor error"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",By any man aboard.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Listen carefully.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Science
Officer."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","What you do not know and must be told is that my command orders
on this subject are precise and inviolable."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","No act, no provocation"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Will be considered sufficient reason to
violate the zone."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","We may defend ourselves,"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","But if necessary to avoid interspace
war,"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Both these outposts and this vessel will be
considered expendable."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Captain out.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","After a whole century, what will a Romulan ship look like, Mister
Stiles?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",I doubt they'll radio and identify themselves.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",I had no idea that history was your specialty.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Their war, Mister Stiles."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Not yours.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Don't forget it.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Outpost 2 was the first to go silent, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Open a channel to our nearest command base.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Quarter hour reports
on our position and status."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Call battle stations, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Energise main phasers, Mister Styles."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",All weapons to full power.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","We're minutes away, Hansen."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",What's your status?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Confirm what hit you, Hansen."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",What vessel?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Identity?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Can you locate the intruder for us?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Tie us in.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Affirmative.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","You're visual, Hansen."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","What do you have on the
intruder?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Lock us onto your screen.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Do you have phaser capacity?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",We're still out of range.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Make a challenge.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Warn that ship off.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Position of the intruder, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",When they opened fire.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Perhaps necessary when they use their
weapon."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",SPOCK: I have a blip on the motion sensor.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Could be the
intruder."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Go to full magnification.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",I don't see anything.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",I can't understand it.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Discontinue.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Contact remaining outposts.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Have them signal us any
sightings or sensor readings in their area."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Their invisibility screen may work both ways.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","With that kind of
power consumption, they may not be able to see us."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Parallel course.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Negative.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","You and Mister Sulu will match its course and speed
with the object on our sensors exactly, move for move."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","If he has
sensors, I want him to think we're a reflection, an echo."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Under no
circumstances are you to cross into the Neutral Zone without my direct
orders."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Cancel battle stations.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","All decks, standby alert."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Mister Stiles.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Mister Stiles, are you questioning my orders?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Very well.

KIRK,"Balance

figure then turns, and we see someone who looks just like - a Vulcan."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Both Spock's eyebrows hit the ceiling.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","There's a long silence and a lot
of stares.)"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Decoding?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","I didn't quite get that, Mister Stiles."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Repeat it.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","I assume you're complimenting Mister Spock on his ability to
decode."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Well, here's one thing you can be sure of, Mister."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Leave any
bigotry in your quarters."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",There's no room for it on the Bridge.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Do I
make myself clear?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Stay with him, helm."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","What's our position, navigator?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Bring it to the briefing room.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Are you ready, gentlemen?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Comments?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Yes, well gentlemen, the question still remains."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Can we engage
them with a reasonable possibility of victory?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Meaning we can outrun them?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Go ahead, Mister Styles."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",I called this session for opinions.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Explain.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Sit down, Mister."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Are you suggesting we fight to prevent a fight?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Captain to Bridge.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",What's our position?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Are you continuing to broadcast tactical reports?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",And at this distance?
KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Check our course ahead, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","All hands, battle
stations."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","I hope we won't need your services, Bones."
KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Plot his exact point of entry, Mister Stiles."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","The moment he begins entering the comet's tail, he becomes
visible."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","End run, gentlemen."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","We'll swing around the other side and
catch him at that moment."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Let's get him, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Steady as she goes.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Phaser crews ready?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",He'll only be visible for a moment.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Stand by.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",At the last moment he must have guessed our move.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Hard to
starboard, helm!"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",He did exactly what I would have done.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","I won't underestimate him
again."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Now, fire blind."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Lay down a pattern.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Full astern!
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Emergency warp speed!
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Do we have emergency warp?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Navigation?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Phasers, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Feed this to the space recorder and jettison immediately.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Yeoman.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Affirmative.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Continue log entries.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Limited range.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Back to his old course.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",I wouldn't make that assumption.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","I don't think their Captain will
either."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Same as before, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Stay with him.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Let's get them while we are.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Before we enter the Neutral Zone.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Full ahead, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Maximum warp.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Phasers, stand by."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","We know their Achilles heel, Mister Stiles."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Their weapon takes
all their energy."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",They must become visible in order to launch it.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","I'm aware of that, Mister Stiles."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Are phasers ready?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Lieutenant Uhura, inform Command base, In my opinion, no option."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","On my responsibility, we are proceeding into the Neutral Zone."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Steady
as we go, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Continue firing.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Cease fire.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",However?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",What?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Go to sensor probes.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","All right, Mister Spock, work quietly."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Thank you, Yeoman."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Bring it to the Bridge.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","I'll be there in a
moment."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",I wish I were on a long sea voyage somewhere.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Not too much deck
tennis, no frantic dancing, and no responsibility."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Why me?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","I look
around that Bridge, and I see the men waiting for me to make the next
move."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","And Bones, what if I'm wrong?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","No, I don't really expect an answer."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",It's all right.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",It's all right.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Power on.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Reverse course.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","He'll try to slip
under us."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Phasers, fire."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Cease fire.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Analysis, quickly."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Helm, hard over."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Phasers, fire point-blank."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Captain to Sickbay.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Casualties?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Thank you, Doctor."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","(the lights come back on) Report, Mister
Spock?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Ship damage?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Weapons status?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Fully operable, Scotty?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Go.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Lieutenant Uhura, take over navigation."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Maybe we can pull them back to our side of the Neutral Zone.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Hold
our position."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Play dead.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Forward phasers, stand by."
KIRK,"Balance

Fire!"
KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Fire!
KIRK,"Balance

KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Mister Sulu, prepare to move in on the
Romulan vessel."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Ship-to-ship, Uhura."
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Put this on the screen.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Captain.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Standing by to beam your survivors aboard our ship.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",Prepare to abandon your vessel.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",What purpose will it serve to die?
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","Are you all right, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","And you, Stiles?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","How many men did we lose, Bones?"
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror",It never makes any sense.
KIRK,"Balance
of Terror","We both have to know that there was a
reason."
MCCOY,"Balance

MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror",You're discussing tactics.
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","Do you realise what this really comes
down to?"
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","Millions and millions of lives hanging on what this vessel
does."
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror",Based on what?
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror",Memories of a war over a century ago?
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","On theories
about a people we've never even met face to face?"
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","War is never imperative, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror",Amen to that.
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","We're taking a big gamble, Jim."
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","Do we violate the treaty, Captain?"
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","Once inside, they can claim we did."
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror",A set-up.
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","They want war, we
furnish the provocation."
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","Captain, I"
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror",But I've got one.
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","Something I seldom say to a customer, Jim."
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","In
this galaxy, there's a mathematical probability of three million
Earth-type planets."
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","And in all of the universe, three million million
galaxies like this."
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","And in all of that, and perhaps more, only one of
each of us."
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror",Don't destroy the one named Kirk.
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror",McCoy here.
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror",Twenty two so far.
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","Mainly radiation burns, mostly from the
ship's outer areas."
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","Could have been much, much worse, Captain."
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror",Only one.
MCCOY,"Balance

MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","The boy who was getting married this
morning."
MCCOY,"Balance
of Terror","His fiancée
is at the chapel."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Still no answer from Earth Outpost number two, Captain, and
now number three's gone silent."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Earth Outpost four reports they're under attack.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","A space
vessel, identity unknown."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Verified, Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Referring to the map on your screens, you will note beyond the
moving position of our vessel, a line of Earth outpost stations."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Constructed on asteroids, they monitor the Neutral Zone established by
treaty after the Earth-Romulan conflict a century ago."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","As you may recall from your histories,
this conflict was fought,"
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","By our standards today, with primitive
atomic weapons and in primitive space vessels"
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Which allowed no quarter, no captives."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Nor
was there even ship-to-ship visual communication."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Therefore, no human,
Romulan, or ally has ever seen the other."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Earth believes the Romulans
to be warlike, cruel, treacherous, and only the Romulans know what they
think of Earth."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","The treaty, set by sub-space radio, established this
Neutral Zone, entry into which by either side, would constitute an act
of war."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",The treaty has been unbroken since that time.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Captain.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Outpost two coming into sensor range, Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Sweeping the area of Outpost two.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Sensor reading indefinite.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Double-checking Outpost three.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",I read dust and debris.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Both Earth
outposts gone,
and the asteroids they were constructed on, pulverised."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","And showing on my sensors, Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",At least it's still there.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Outpost four disintegrated, Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Disappeared.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Interesting how they became visible for just a
moment."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Invisibility is theoretically possible, Captain, with selective
bending of light."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",But the power cost is enormous.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Blip has changed its heading.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",And in a very leisurely manoeuvre.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",They may not be aware of us.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",His heading is now one eleven mark fourteen.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","The exact heading a
Romulan would take, Jim, for the Neutral Zone and home."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","I have a fix on it, Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","I believe I can lock on it, get a
picture of their Bridge."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Very well.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",(runs the tape through his computer)
SPOCK,"Balance

SPOCK,"Balance

course, Captain, toward the Neutral Zone."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",From the outpost's protective shield.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Cast
rodinium."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",This is the hardest substance known to our science.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Lab theorises an enveloping energy plasma forcing an implosion.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Obviously, their weaponry is superior to ours, and they have a
practical invisibility screen."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Or on what this vessel fails to do, Doctor."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",I agree.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Attack.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Yes, indeed we do, Mister Stiles."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","And if Romulans are an
offshoot of my Vulcan blood, and I think this likely, then attack
becomes even more imperative."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","It is for them, Doctor."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Vulcan, like Earth, had its aggressive
colonising period."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Savage, even by Earth standards."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","And if Romulans
retain this martial philosophy, then weakness is something we dare not
show."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Do you want a galactic war on your conscience?
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","A comet, magnitude seven, dead ahead, and the intruder changing
course toward it."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Quite ordinary.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","An ionised mass, a trail of frozen vapour
particles."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",It leaves a visible trail.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Intruder now bearing directly for comet's tail.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","He's maintaining that bearing, Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","We're losing sensor contact, Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","It'll take time to correct, sir."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Impossible, Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Phasers operational, Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Intruder bearing one eleven mark
fourteen."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","He may think we're destroyed, Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Intruder holding steady.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Course one eleven mark fourteen.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","They did, Doctor."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","We're still on our side, Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Motion sensor signal stopped.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Vessel wreckage.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Metal moulds, conduit, plastoform and a body,
Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",However.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Insufficient mass, sir."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Simple debris.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Not a vessel, a trick."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Nothing, sir."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",No motion out there at all.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","We've lost them,
Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Captain, I must make further repairs on the transfer coil."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","It's
giving out again."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Debris on our scanners.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Same type as before, sir, except, one metal-cased object!"
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Nuclear device of some kind, sir."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Our phasers detonated it less
than one hundred metres away."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Mainly overloads and circuit burnouts.
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","We have engine power now, Captain, if you'd like to move off and
make repairs."
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Damage reports, Mister Stiles?"
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror",Will you require assistance here?
SPOCK,"Balance
of Terror","Yes, very well, thank you, Captain."
SPOCK,"Balance

SULU,"Balance
of Terror","We're staying with
them."
SULU,"Balance
of Terror","Attack, without a visible target?"
SULU,"Balance
of Terror",How do we aim our phasers?
SULU,"Balance
of Terror",And hope for a lucky shot before they zero in on us?
SULU,"Balance
of Terror",And if they could report they destroyed us?
SULU,"Balance
of Terror","All stations manned, Captain."
SULU,"Balance
of Terror","Acknowledged, Captain."
SULU,"Balance
of Terror","Phaser crew signal ready, sir."
SULU,"Balance
of Terror","Sir, nothing in"
SULU,"Balance

SULU,"Balance
of Terror",Phaser overload.
SULU,"Balance
of Terror",Control circuit burnout.
SULU,"Balance
of Terror","Captain, are they surrendering?"
SULU,"Balance
of Terror","Full power, sir."
SULU,"Balance
of Terror",It's still overtaking us.
SULU,"Balance
of Terror","If we can get one
phaser working, sir, one shot might detonate it."
SULU,"Balance
of Terror",Ten seconds to impact.
SULU,"Balance
of Terror","Captain, It's dissipating, sir."
SULU,"Balance
of Terror","Five, four, three, two, one."
SULU,"Balance
of Terror",Impact!
SULU,"Balance

SULU,"Balance

SULU,"Balance

UHURA,"Balance

UHURA,"Balance

UHURA,"Balance

UHURA,"Balance

UHURA,"Balance

UHURA,"Balance

UHURA,"Balance
of Terror","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"Balance
of Terror",Picking up communication.
UHURA,"Balance
of Terror",It's from their ship.
UHURA,"Balance
of Terror","Sounds like code, sir."
UHURA,"Balance
of Terror","Cryptography is working on it, sir."
UHURA,"Balance
of Terror",Transmission has been cut off.
UHURA,"Balance
of Terror","(to Spock) I made a tape of it,
sir."
UHURA,"Balance
of Terror","This is Uhura, Captain."
UHURA,"Balance
of Terror","Course unchanged, sir."
UHURA,"Balance

UHURA,"Balance

STILES,"Balance

sir."
STILES,"Balance

STILES,"Balance
of Terror","We know Outpost four has been attacked, sir, so if we intercept
Romulans now"
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","You'll know, sir."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",They're painted like a giant bird-of-prey.
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",Family history.
STILES,"Balance

service then."
STILES,"Balance

STILES,"Balance

that war, sir."

STILES,"Balance

STILES,"Balance

STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Don't you mean interception course, sir?"
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Captain, may I respectfully remind the Captain what has
happened?"
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","The Romulans have crossed the Neutral Zone, attacked our
outposts, killed our men."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",Add to that the fact it was a sneak attack.
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Negative, sir."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","I'm pointing our that we could have Romulan
spies aboard this ship."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",Give it to Spock.
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Nothing, sir."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","I was suggesting that Mister Spock could probably translate it
for you, sir."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","I'm not sure, sir."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","You do, sir."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","We'll enter the Neutral Zone in less than an hour, sir."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Assuming, of course, that we don't turn back."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","To be used in chasing them or retreating, sir?"
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",We have to attack immediately.
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",They're still on our side of the Neutral Zone.
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","There would be
no doubt they broke the treaty."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",Aim with sensors.
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Not accurate, but if we blanket them"
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",And if we don't?
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Once back, they'll report that we saw their
weapons and ran."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",These are Romulans!
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","You run away from them and you guarantee
war."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",They'll be back.
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Not just one ship but with everything they've
got."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","You know that, Mister Science Officer."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","You've the expert on these
people, always left out that one point."
STILES,"Balance

STILES,"Balance

why."

STILES,"Balance
of Terror",All phasers fire.
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Estimate it'll overtake us in two minutes, sir."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",It must have a range limit.
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","We'll enter the Neutral Zone in one minute,
Captain."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Sir, at this distance?"
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","A phaser hit at this distance would be the wildest stroke of
luck."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Phasers show ready, sir."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Twenty seconds to Neutral Zone, sir."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",What?
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Coming around, sir."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Phasers, fire."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Phasers, fire!"
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","Sir, my first assignment was in weapons control."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",Negative.
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","This time, we'll handle things without your help, Vulcan."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",Tomlinson!
STILES,"Balance
of Terror","I'm alive, sir."
STILES,"Balance
of Terror",But I wouldn't be.
STILES,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

Commander Hansen."
HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror","Completely destroyed, even though we were alerted."
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror","Had our deflector
shield on maximum."
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror",Hit by enormous power.
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror","First attack blew our
deflector shield."
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror",If they hit us again with our deflector shield gone.
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror","Do you read me, Enterprise?"
HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror","And even
through our deflectors, it did this."
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror",Can you see?
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror",No identification.
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror",No answer to our challenge.
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror",Only a glimpse of it.
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror","Then they fired something at us, some form of
high-energy plasma."
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror",Fantastic power.
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror",And then the whole vessel disappeared.
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror","But it's out
there somewhere."
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror",Our sensors show that much.
HANSEN,"Balance
of Terror","Enterprise, something
coming on our viewing screen, coming at us fast."
HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

see it?"
HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

HANSEN,"Balance

COMMANDER,"Balance

COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Attend the cloaking system.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",That Earth outpost called to an Earth vessel.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Now it follows
us."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Perhaps so, but my judgment prevails."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",It is good we approach the Neutral Zone.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Not too soon for me
to see the stars of home."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",I know they are following.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","First study the enemy, seek weakness."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","If I were their
commander, that is what I would do."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",A message was dispatched.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",You've broken the rule of silence.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Your carelessness might have ended this glorious mission.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",You're reduced two steps in rank.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Return to post.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Danger and I are old companions.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",I think you do.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","No need to tell you what happens when we
reach home with proof of the Earthmen's weakness."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","And we will have
proof."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",The Earth commander will follow.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",He must.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","When he attacks, we
will destroy him."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Our gift to the homeland, another war."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Must it always be so?
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","How many comrades have we lost in this
way?"
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Obedience.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Duty.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Death and more death.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Soon even enough for
the Praetor's taste."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Centurion, I find myself wishing for destruction
before we can return."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Worry not.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Like you, I am too well-trained in my
duty to permit it."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Continue evasive manoeuvres.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Now, back to the first
course."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",How pleasing to the eye it is.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Behold a
marvel in the darkness."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Its many particles will obscure their sensing device,
Centurion."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Once fully obscured, we will turn suddenly back upon our
adversary."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Clear?
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Escape manoeuvre one, quickly!"
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Divert all power to weapons.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Activate our cloak.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Quickly!
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Its commander is not one to repeat a mistake.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Evasive action.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",The Earth ship again.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",No need.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",The Centurion is dead.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",No.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","No, he's shrewd, this starship commander."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","He tries to
make us waste energy."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",He has estimated we have only enough.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",It is time.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",All debris into disposal tubes.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","The body of the Centurion, too."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Forgive me, my old friend,
but I must use all my experience now to get home."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Shh.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","He is there, somewhere."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",I feel it.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",We have him.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Move toward him.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","He's a sorcerer, that one."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","He reads the thoughts in my
brain."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Our fuel supply all but gone and he stays out of reach.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Perhaps we can yet save your Praetor's pride for him.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","More
debris into the tubes."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","Decius, do we have the old-style nuclear
warheads aboard?"
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Place one with the debris.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Proximity fuse.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Now we go home.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",We've damaged ourselves.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Our fuel reserve is gone.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",I do not trust their Captain.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","We will attack, but on my order."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",No.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","No, that is not our way."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","I regret that
we meet in this way."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",You and I are of a kind.
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","In a different reality, I
could have called you friend."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","We are creatures of duty, Captain."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror","I have
lived my life by it."
COMMANDER,"Balance
of Terror",Just one more duty to perform.
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror","It consumes much power, Commander."
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror","With no enemy to concern
us."
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror",Which neither retreats nor grows nearer.
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror",It turns as we turn.
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror","Commander, it is our judgment we run from a reflection."
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror","Cloaking system on, sir."
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror","We enter it, Commander."
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror","At last the screen is clear, Commander."
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror",Our reflection no longer follows us.
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror","Commander, the reflection returns."
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror","Commander, our fuel runs low."
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror",It moves as we move.
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror",Commander!
ROMULAN,"Balance
of Terror","A signal, Commander."
CENTURION,"Balance
of Terror","(an older man) If an Earth ship, why does he not attack?"
CENTURION,"Balance
of Terror","Take care, Commander."
CENTURION,"Balance
of Terror","He has friends, and friends of his
kind mean power."
CENTURION,"Balance
of Terror",And power is danger.
CENTURION,"Balance
of Terror","We've seen a hundred campaigns together, and still I do not
understand you."
CENTURION,"Balance
of Terror","If we are the strong, isn't this the signal for war?"
CENTURION,"Balance
of Terror","Our portion, Commander, is obedience."
CENTURION,"Balance
of Terror",You spoke of entrapment.
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",My Commander sent for Decius.
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","Only in code, Commander."
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","To inform our Praetor of this glorious
mission."
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",The Earth vessel?
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",Impossible.
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","Commander, they stay within range."
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","I will
tend to the centurion."
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","Why don't we fire, Commander?"
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","Yes, Commander."
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","Now twenty full cycles, Commander."
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","Still no
sign."
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",I say he's been fooled.
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",He must have gone on.
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","How, Commander."
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",How?
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",We are beaten.
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",Can it be true?
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","The Praetor's finest and
proudest flagship beaten."
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","Yes Commander, but only for self-destruction."
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","Yes, Commander."
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",At once.
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",Glorious.
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",Glorious.
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",They're at our mercy.
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","Commander, I remind you of your duty."
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","Still no sign of movement, Commander."
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",And it is our duty to crush the Praetor's enemies.
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",We are in the Neutral Zone.
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror",They will not enter.
DECIUS,"Balance
of Terror","If you refuse,
permit me the glory of the kill, Commander."

RAND,"Balance

RAND,"Balance

KIRK,"What

KIRK,"What

KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Do you think there's any chance of him still being alive?
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Keep trying.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",And since then two expeditions have failed to find him.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Enterprise to Korby.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","We have your
co-ordinates pin-pointed."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",We're preparing to beam down a party.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","It may
interest you that we have aboard this vessel"
KIRK,"What

KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Agreed, Doctor."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","However, there will be two of us."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","We're on our way, Doctor."

wrong entry point."

KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Beam down two security men.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Some delay in meeting us.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Probably nothing at all.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Kirk out.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Corridors could be quite deep.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Getting here may have taken more time
than he estimated."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Don't worry.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Rayburn, maintain post here."
KIRK,"What

KIRK,"What

KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Apparently an accident.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Tell the
Enterprise to have a full security party standing by."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",And we'll both report in at hourly intervals.
KIRK,"What

lose contact, or if he fails to hear from either of us, he's to beam
the security party down immediately."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Kirk out.
KIRK,"What

introduce yourself."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",It wasn't your fault.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Kirk to Rayburn, report."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'm required to
make a security confirmation."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","When I call my ship, if you list your
personnel, cargo requirements, any special needs"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Rayburn, are you receiving?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I've lost contact with my guard.
KIRK,"What

KIRK,"What

KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Yes, I know your reputation."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","The whole galaxy knows who you are

KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",That's why all this makes no sense.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Or disobey an order from her.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Doctor, do I need to be a prisoner to be convinced?"
KIRK,"What

KIRK,"What

KIRK,"What

you programme
them, then why did Brown try to shoot me?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Why did he kill two of my

KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","There are many things I don't understand, Doctor."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Mind your own business, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'm sick of your half-breed
interference, do you hear?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Mind your own business, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'm
sick of your half-breed (passes out, the other one wakes up)"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",As far as I know.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Well, there's one difference between us."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I'm hungry.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Eating is a pleasure, sir."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Unfortunately, one you will never
know."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",He's an exact duplicate?
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",What about memory?
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Tell me about Sam.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",He saw me off on this mission.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","He said he was being transferred to Earth colony two research
station."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Obviously, I can't, but we do have some interesting differences."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Programming.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Different word, but the same old promises made by
Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Hitler, Ferris, Maltuvis."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","It can also be improved by eliminating love, tenderness,
sentiment."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","The other side of the coin, Doctor."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",All you wanted before was my understanding.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Yes, yes."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","No one need know, only to frighten uninformed minds."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",You've created your own Kirk.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Why do you need me?
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'm impressed, Doctor, but not the way you think!"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","(leaps up with
cord he's untied from the chair leg and loops it around Korby's throat)
Stand back, Ruk!"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I'll kill him!
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Stay back.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","(goes through door,
releasing Korby into Ruk's arms)"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Christine, is that you?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Andrea, kiss me."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","(she does, then raises her
arm to slap him."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",He stops her and pulls her in for a passionate embrace)
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","What's the matter, Andrea?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Confused?
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Emotion, Ruk?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","You disapprove of Miss Chapel's orders to save my
life?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Why?
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Can't your memory banks solve a simple equation like that?
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","What happened to the old ones, Ruk?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Is it possible they built their machines too well, gave them
pride and a desire to survive?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Machines that wanted logic and order and
found that frustrated by the illogical emotional creatures that built
them?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","And isn't it Korby who's creating the same danger to you all over
again?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions that
logic cannot solve."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",And Korby?
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",The danger to you is Korby.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","The old ones programmed you, too, but it became possible to
destroy them."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","That's it, Ruk!"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Logic!
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","You can't protect someone who's trying to
destroy you!"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","You were a man with respect for all things
alive."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",How can I explain the change in you?
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","If I was to tell Earth I
was in your hands, to tell them what has become (jumps Korby and traps
his arm in a door."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",The skin tears to reveal electronics)
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Spock.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",He must've got my message.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","She killed the android, Korby, the same way you killed Ruk."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Is
this your perfect world, your flawless beings killing off one another?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Aren't you doing exactly what you hate most in humans, killing with no
more concern than when you turn off a light?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Then prove it.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Give me that phaser gun.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","If there's any human left
in you, give it to me."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Andrea, give me the weapon."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","In here, Spock."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Doctor Korby was never here.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",She's staying with the ship.
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Something bothering you, Mister
Spock?"
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'll remember that Mister Spock, the next time I find myself in a
similar situation."
KIRK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Steady as we go, helm."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I know he's alive down there, Captain."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Roger's a very determined man.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",He'd find a way to live.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",His last signal told about finding underground caverns.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Have you ever been engaged, Mister Spock?"
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Yes, it's Roger."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Hello, Roger."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Yes, Roger."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Yes, Roger."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Everything's all right now.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",He said he'd be waiting.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Thank you.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Doctor Brown!
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",It's Roger's assistant.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Brownie, where's Roger?"
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Brownie, what is it?"
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Don't you recognise me?
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I suppose living here for five years.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I don't remember Doctor Korby mentioning an Andrea.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Oh, I knew I'd find you."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Roger.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Roger, that"
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Where is Captain Kirk?
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Yes, I am concerned."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Yes, let's start with Andrea."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",How convenient.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Given a mechanical Doctor Brown, a mechanical geisha would be
no more difficult."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Did you?
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Roger, what's happened to you?"
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","When I sat in your class, you
wouldn't even dream of harming an insect or an animal."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Their life was
sacred to you then."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I don't know.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",They're exact.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I honestly don't know.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Are you all right?
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Yes, thank you."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Captain.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","No, I'm not torn."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I'm puzzled.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I'm worried.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Nothing he hasn't told you.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I know it doesn't make sense.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","What
he's done may seem wrong, but he is Roger Korby, whatever he seems to
be doing."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",No.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",You're forgetting how well I know him.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","He's as sane as you
or I."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Please, don't ask me to make that choice."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'd much rather you
push me off the same precipice where Matthews died."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Oh, I can't."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","(pushes plate away) Please, go ahead and eat."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Roger, I. Ruk, no!"
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",(runs after him)
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Ruk, stop!"
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Doctor Korby said you are to
obey me!"
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Ruk!
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Ruk!
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Ruk, I order you not to harm him!"
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Are you, Roger?"
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",But he'll never find us in this maze.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Don't you see, Roger?"
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Everything you've done has proved it
isn't you."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Thank you for letting me make the decision,
Captain."
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I'm quite certain I'm doing the right thing.
CHAPEL,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",(leaves)
UHURA,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Beginning signals to surface, sir."
UHURA,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I've tried all frequencies, sir."
UHURA,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",No return signal.
UHURA,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I've run all frequencies a second time.
UHURA,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",There's no
UHURA,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Frequency open, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Ship's record banks show little we don't already know about this
planet, Captain."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Gravity is one point one of Earth, atmosphere within safety limits."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","It may have been inhabited once, but the sun in this system has
been fading steadily for a half million years."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Now, Doctor Korby, often
called the Pasteur of archaeological medicine."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","His translation of
medical records from the Orion ruins revolutionised our immunisation
techniques."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",That's an unusual request.
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",You're certain you recognise his voice?
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Any problems, Captain?"
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","We were becoming concerned, Captain."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Your check-in was overdue
and since we'd not heard from your security team"
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Captain, are you all right?"
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",You sound tired.
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Acknowledge, Captain."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Is everything all right?
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Captain!
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Captain, We finished ahead of schedule."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",You're going back down with the command pack?
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Yes.
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","very well, Captain."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","No problems here, sir."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Security, Spock here."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Status of your landing party?
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Have them meet me in the transporter room after the Captain has
beamed down."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Captain Kirk!
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Captain, are you all right?"
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Nurse?
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Where's Doctor Korby?
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Frankly, I was rather dismayed by your use of the term
half-breed, Captain."
SPOCK,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","You must admit it is an unsophisticated
expression."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Enterprise, come in, Enterprise."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",This is Roger Korby.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Repeating, this is Doctor Roger Korby."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Do you read me, Enterprise?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","This
is Doctor Roger Korby standing by."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I've a rather unusual request, Captain Kirk."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Beam down
alone, just yourself."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","We've made discoveries of such a nature they may
require an extraordinary decision from you."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Christine!
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Darling, how, Where are you?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Yes, yes, by all means,
Captain."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I, I had no idea, no hope."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Darling, are you all right?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Here, Captain."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I, I've been looking forward to (sees Chapel, and
they kiss)"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Everything's all right now.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Oh, forgive me, Captain."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'm, er,
I'm Roger Korby."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",What?
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",How did it happen?
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'm terribly sorry, Captain."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Perhaps if I'd been there.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I know
the passages so well."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Captain, I'd much prefer"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'd prefer you waited, Captain, please, till I've talked to you."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I'm sorry.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","If they should send down more people,"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",He won't be harmed.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I promise you.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Isn't it possible there could
be things here unknown to you, so terribly important"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Andrea.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","This is necessary, Captain."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",You will understand.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Andrea.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","(she
reaches for Kirk's phaser, but he grabs her to use as a shield and aims
it at Brown instead, while moving towards a table to use as a barrier
instead of the girl)"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","If you move or cry out, Ruk may injure you."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",At least wait until we can talk.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","This is not a vain display, Captain."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I'm a scientist.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","You
obviously know my reputation."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Trust me.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",There's so much you must learn Before you make a final judgment.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",For example (to Ruk) Andrea.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","You see, Captain?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",That's enough.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",You are not to mock Christine.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","You will never
harm her."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",You will not disobey her orders.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Satisfied, Captain Kirk?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Both
love and trust."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Now, give me twenty four hours to convince you."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",What would your first duty be upon return to your vessel?
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Report!
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Do you realise the number of discoveries lost because of
superstition, of ignorance, of a layman's inability to comprehend?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Ruk was programmed to protect my experiments.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","The logic of his
machine mind saw danger to me."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Ruk destroyed them both, totally against my wishes I assure you."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Ruk was still tending the machinery when we arrived here.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","How
many centuries?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Even Ruk doesn't know.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","With his help, ith the records I
could find, we built Brown."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Ruk, no!"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Andrea, it's sufficient that it does disturb her."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","You will call
me Doctor Korby from now on, Andrea."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Remarkable, isn't she?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Notice the the lifelike pigmentation, the
variation in skin tones."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","The flesh, the flesh has warmth."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","There's even
a pulse, physical sensation."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Christine, you must realise an android's like a computer."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","It
does only what I
programme."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","As a trained scientist yourself, you must realise that"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",You think I could love a machine?
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Andrea's incapable of that.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",She simply obeys orders.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","She has no
meaning for me."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",There's no emotional bond.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Andrea, kiss Captain Kirk."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Now strike him.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",You see?
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","There's no emotion in it, no emotional
involvement."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",She simply responds to orders.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","She's a totally logical
computer."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",A thing is not a woman.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Now do you understand?
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I will answer all of your questions now.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",This is how you make an android.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","(Kirk is
naked on one side of circular table, a human-shaped blob on the other)
Andrea."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","(the table starts turning) He's not being harmed, I promise."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Christine, if I'd simply beamed up to their vessel with Brown
and the others, I'd have given them objects of curiosity, beginnings of
wild stories, foolish theories."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Ruk!
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Watch carefully.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","(the blob turns
into Kirk, and the table is stopped) Choose, Christine."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Which is your
captain?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Synthetic organs are in place.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","We merely synchronise them with
Kirk's autonomic nervous system, duplicating the rhythms of his body."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","At the same time, we duplicate the mental pattern."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Now, physical
pattern complete, we now make a mental pattern."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Ready for final
synaptic fusion."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Andrea, stand by for cortex circuits."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","The android will
be so perfect It could even replace the captain."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","The same memories, the
same attitudes, the same abilities."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Activate circuits.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Complete.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Now, meet an android."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",He even has your sense of humour.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","One at a time, gentlemen."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Captain?
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",In every detail.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",You might as well try to outthink a calculating machine.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Totally unimportant ones.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",You may leave now.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","(Kirk2 leaves) You
haven't guessed the rest?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Not even you, Christine?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","What you saw was
only a machine, Only half of what I could've accomplished, Do you
understand?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","By continuing the process I could've transferred you, your
very consciousness into that android."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Your soul, if you wish."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","All of
you."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","In android form, a human being can have practical immortality."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Can
you understand what I'm offering mankind?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Can you understand that a human converted to an android can be
programmed for the better?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Can you imagine how life could be improved
if we could do away with jealousy, greed, hate?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",No one need ever die again.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","No disease, no deformities."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","why even
fear can be programmed away, replaced with joy."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'm offering you a
pracical heaven, a new paradise, and all I need is your help."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I need transportation to a planet colony with proper raw
materials."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'm sure there are several good possibilities among your
next stops."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",No diversion from your route.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I want no suspicions aroused.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'll begin producing androids carefully, selectively."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","They must be strongly infiltrated into society before the
android existence is revealed."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I want no wave of hysteria to destroy
what is good and right."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","You with me, Captain?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I created him to impress you, not to replace you."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Ruk, protect!"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",A small colony.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Abundant raw materials.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","You made a good
beginning, Captain."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Ruk, I would like"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Ruk, stop!"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Your programming.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","(fires phaser, Ruk vanishes) I had
no choice."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","It's still me, Christine."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",Roger.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'm in
here."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",You can't imagine how it was.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I was frozen, dying."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","My legs were
gone."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I was, I had only my brain between life and death."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","This can be
repaired easier than another man can set a broken finger."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","I'm still the
same as I was before, Christine, perhaps even better."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",(into comm.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",unit) Andrea.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",There's someone in the outer junction.

Are Little Girls Made Of?",Test me.
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Ask me to solve any, equate,
transmit."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Christine, Christine, let me prove myself."
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?","Does this make
such a difference?"
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",I am Roger Korby!
KORBY,"What
Are Little Girls Made Of?",No.
KORBY,"What

SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"I have them, Captain."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Closing off deck fourteen, search in progress."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Negative in the deck area, Captain."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,He may have gotten out.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Expanding search to adjoining sections.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Interesting.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Your Earth people glorify organised violence for forty centuries, but you imprison those who employ it privately."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"We disposed of emotion, Doctor."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Where there is no emotion there is no motive for violence.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Fifty seven minutes, thirty seconds, Captain."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,An identification tape from our ship's library on Doctor Simon Van Gelder.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Doctor Van Gelder, Captain."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,No mistake.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,There's a full ID tape on him.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Assigned there six months ago as Doctor Adams' associate.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Gentlemen, I suggest you ask Doctor Adams if he wants Van Gelder returned."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"I believe we should, Jim."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Problem, Captain?"
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Enterprise.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Spock here.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Affirmative, Captain."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Enterprise out.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Neural neutraliser.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Can you explain that, Doctor Van Gelder?"
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,This room.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,What happens there?
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Can you give us your present location, Captain?"
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Then you're with Doctor Adams now.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Captain, Van Gelder has made reference to a particular treatment room."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,The term was neural neutraliser.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Van Gelder is extremely agitated, Captain, and warns that you are in danger."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Please repeat, Captain."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,I didn't receive that.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"When do you plan to beam back up, Captain?"
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,And you will continue to check in every four hours?
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Destroy how?
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,What?
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Enterprise log.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"First officer Spock, acting captain."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,I must now use an ancient Vulcan technique to probe into Van Gelder's tortured mind.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"I've never used it on a human, Doctor."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"It's a hidden, personal thing to the Vulcan people, part of our private lives."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,It could be dangerous.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Do you understand?
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"It requires I make pressure changes in your nerves, your blood vessels."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"This will not affect you, Doctor McCoy, only the person I touch."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,It is not hypnosis.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,You begin to feel a strange euphoria.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Your body floats.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Open your mind.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,We move together.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Our minds sharing the same thoughts.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,What is our name?
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Who are we?
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Doctor Adams.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,The neural neutraliser.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,What did he do to us?
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Yes.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Yes.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Yes.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Yes.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Empty.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Lonely.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Empty.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Emergency channel D.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Keep trying.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,(to McCoy) Get some security people and follow me down.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Energise.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"(pushes a load of buttons) Enterprise, this is Spock."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Force field has been eliminated.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,(turns main power back on again)
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,It was from Van Gelder.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,He thought you'd like to know the treatment room had been dismantled and the equipment destroyed.
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,"Acknowledged, Captain."
SPOCK,Dagger Of The Mind,Warp factor one.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Tantalus colony.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Adams here.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Terribly sorry, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,I take all the blame.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Let me repeat, he's clever as well as extremely violent."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Take all possible precautions.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Captain Kirk, Doctor Adams here."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Is Doctor Van Gelder all right?
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"And your people, no injuries?"
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Yes, of course."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,You're certain he's all right?
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,We've been very concerned.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,In the violent state he's in
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"He'd been doing some experimental work, Captain, an experimental beam we'd hoped might rehabilitate incorrigibles."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Van Gelder felt he hadn't the moral right to expose another man to something he hadn't tried on his own person.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Yes, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,May I inquire about your patrol destinations?
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Are you passing near any hospital facilities superior to ours?
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"I'd like Van Gelder to have the best possible treatment, of course."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"No need to apologise, Captain Kirk."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"In fact, I'd take it as a personal favour if you'd beam down and look into it yourself."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,I'm sure you realise we don't get too many visitors here.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Oh, I, er, Captain, I would appreciate it if you could come down with a minimum staff."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,We're forced to limit outside contact as much as possible.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Hello Captain Kirk, and er"
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Thank you.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Thank you, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Welcome to Devil's Island, Doctor."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,I shall indeed.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Won't you?
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"No, no."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"That won't be necessary in your case, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Just keep it out of sight, hmm?"
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,I know you people feel as naked without a weapon as we do without a medikit.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,A small toast.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Do you mind?
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"It's such a great day for us here on Tantalus when we have visitors, no matter what the excuse."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Oh, now, Captain, you made your apology from upstairs."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Now forget it.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"I don't think you'll be able to get through the security screen, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Just a second, hmm?"
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,There.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Now try it.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Ah, Lethe, come in."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Lethe, this is Captain Kirk and Doctor Helen Noel."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Lethe came to us for rehabilitation and stayed on as a therapist, and a very good one too, I might add."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Go right ahead, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Um, part of our cure, if you will, Captain, is to bury the past."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Why should a person go on living with unbearable memories if there's no necess.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Oh, I feel quite sure that you'd concur with me in that, Doctor."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Helen.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Yes.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"And now to the toast, hmm?"
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"You'll forgive us, Lethe."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"There you are, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,To all mankind.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"May we never find space so vast, planets so cold, heart and mind so empty that, that we cannot fill them with love and warmth."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Thank you.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Hi, Carl."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Yes?
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Ah.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"I was afraid you would ask about this, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"One doesn't like to talk about their personal failures, you know?"
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"It was just an experiment that went wrong, I'm afraid."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"I think I'll have to award that round to the Captain, Helen."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,You're fighting over your weight.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"All right, let's take a look."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,A neural neutraliser.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Experimental.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Actually, we don't expect to get much use out of it at all."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"That beam from above neutralises brain waves, relaxes the patient's mind."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Does them no harm, of course, and the effects are only temporary."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Why do we go on using it, hmm, Captain?"
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Hope.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Yes, yes, there's always that slight chance that it might do some good in the more violent cases."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Exactly my point, Helen."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Yes.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Shall we?
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,(he and Noel leave)
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Captain, you remind me of the ancient sceptic who demanded of the wise old sage to be taught all the world's wisdom while standing on one foot."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Right here, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Yes, Simon was a very stubborn man."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,He could've sat in that room for years with the beam at that volume or even higher.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Or if he simply had someone standing by to snap it off in case he got into trouble, but, but no."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,He tried it alone and on full volume.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,It's a pity.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Your Mister Spock sounds like a very excellent second in command, Captain Kirk."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Please tell him to go ahead and speak freely.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,I have to check in with a member of my staff anyway.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Excuse me.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Now Captain Kirk is going to have a complete demonstration.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,I want there to be no doubts whatsoever in his mind.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Mmm.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"You're madly in love with Helen, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"You'd lie, cheat, steal for her, sacrifice your career, your reputation."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,The pain.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Do you feel it, Captain?"
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"You must have her, or the pain grows worse, the pain, the longing for her."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"For years, you've loved her, Captain, for years."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"You must continue to remember that, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"And now, she's gone."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,(machine to maximum)
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"(reduces intensity) Now Captain, you must take your phaser weapon and drop it on the floor."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Captain, the pain increases unless you obey me."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Very good, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Very good indeed.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,And now your communicator.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Drop it on the floor.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Please don't fight me, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,The pain only gets worse when you doubt me.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,You believe in me completely.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,You trust me completely.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Excellent, Captain."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,I compliment you.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Do you know Doctor Van Gelder was down on his hands and knees sobbing at this point?
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,It was so gratifying.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"I'm so fortunate to have had a couple of excellent specimens to, to work with."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,I've learned a great deal.
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Notify security at once, Lethe."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Where is she, Captain?"
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,Where is Helen And with what instructions?
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,"Put him back in the chair, Eli, and find that girl."
ADAMS,Dagger Of The Mind,(Kirk knocks them both out and leaves)
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Where's the captain?
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Which one of you is the captain?
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,My name is Van Gelder.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I want asylum.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"I want your promise first, your word that you won't take me back there, to Tantalus."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,No!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,No.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"No, I'm not going back!"
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I'll disable your vessel first.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"You choose, Captain."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I'll destroy your control panel.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"You smart, button-pushing brass hat."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Wash your hands of it.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Is that your system?
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"You're both quite sure of yourselves, aren't you?"
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Quite expert.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Take him back.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Let someone else worry about him.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,My name?
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,My name is Simon Van Gelder.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"(in great pain) I was the director of, director at the Tantalus colony."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"I was a graduate of, of."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I was assistant to Doctor.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I knew.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"I knew, but they've erased it."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"Edited, adjusted, subverted me, but I won't forget!"
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I won't forget!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"You, you're so blind ignorant."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"You believe I belong back there, don't you?"
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Dead or alive.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"Well, I won't let you take me back."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I'm not going!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I'll die first!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Do you hear?
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I'm not going!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,No!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,No!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,No.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I'm not a criminal!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I do not require neural neutraliser.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,A room.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,A device.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Door.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Control panel.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I see it.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,A device.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,A light!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,The light!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,(screams)
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,No!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"No, no, no."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,No!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,No.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"No, don't let them!"
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,You must warn your captain.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,No!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,No!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Don't let him stay!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Don't let him stay!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Don't!
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,No.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,No.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Don't hypo me.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"Please, don't hypo me."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I'll try not to fight.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,I'll try.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,But you must listen.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Warn your Captain.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Doctor Adams.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"Doc, Doctor Adams will destroy."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Right death.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,You must open my mind.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Let me warn you and explain to you.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"Yes, I begin to feel it."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,We are Simon Van Gelder.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,He can reshape any mind he chooses.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"He used it to erase our memories, put his own thoughts there."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,He was surprised it took so much power.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"We fought him, remember?"
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"But we grew so tired, our minds so blank, so open, that any thought he placed there became our thoughts."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"Our minds so empty like a sponge, needing thoughts, begging."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Empty.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Loneliness.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,"So lonely to be sitting there empty, wanting any word from him."
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Love.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Hate.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Live.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Die.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Such agony to be empty.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,Lonely.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,So empty.
GELDER,Dagger Of The Mind,So empty.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Doctor Helen Noel, Captain."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,We've met.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Don't you remember the science lab Christmas party?
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,You dropped in
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Perhaps it would be simpler if you called me Helen, Captain, since"
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Of course, Captain."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,(in his arms) I wouldn't recommend it for weak hearts.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Perhaps you'll call me Helen, Doctor."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"With so many titles around, we're not going to be sure who's talking to who."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Thank you.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,A shifting of memory patterns is basic to psychotherapy.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Captain, if something hasn't worked out and therefore has no scientific fact"
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Since you brought me down here for advice, Captain"
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Tranquillisers are fine, Captain, but to continually pump chemicals into a person's bloodstream"
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Beam neutralising has been experimented with on Earth, Captain."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"I'm not acquainted with this particular style of equipment, but I can assure you that Doctor Adams has not created a chamber of horrors here."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Oh, that's foolish."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,He's suffering from
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"neuro-synapse damage, as if his brain were short-circuited."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,It's no wonder he's having delusions.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Good evening.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"You could've waited until tomorrow morning to ask me that, Captain."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"I thought they were happy, well-adjusted."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Captain, if you're questioning the methods of a man like Tristan Adams"
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Yes, somewhat, but if you'd simply state any doubts you have to Doctor Adams"
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Coming.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Yes.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Yes, Captain."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,I know my profession.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,(Kirk sits in treatment chair) Ready?
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"We'll try minimum intensity, a second or two."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,(light turns)
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"We already tried it for that long, Captain."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Something happened.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Your face went completely blank.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,(light turns) You're hungry.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"I put that suggestion in your mind, Captain."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,I said simply that you were hungry.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,I think we should try this again.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"(light turns) At the Christmas party, we met, we danced, you talked about the stars."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,I suggest now that it happened in a different way.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,You swept me off my feet and carried me to your cabin.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Captain, if your crew saw you carry me here."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,But my reputation.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"I mean, just having met like this."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"Of course, it would be different if you cared for me."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"No, I prefer honesty."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,(they kiss)
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"No, Doctor!"
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,No!
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,No.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,No!
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"They've taken you from the room, Captain."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,You're in your own quarters now.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Try to remember.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,He placed all that in your mind.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Remember.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Doctor Adams took the controls away from me.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Do you remember the pain and then his voice?
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Remember?
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,No.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Anything's better than Adams' treatment room.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,(he closes the cover behind her and the door opens) Time for another treatment?
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Captain.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Captain?
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,Yes.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,"This isn't right, Captain."
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,(Spock enters) Doctor Adams did this to you.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,The machine wasn't on high enough to kill.
NOEL,Dagger Of The Mind,I understand.
LETHE,Dagger Of The Mind,I love my work.
LETHE,Dagger Of The Mind,"I was another person, malignant, hateful."
LETHE,Dagger Of The Mind,Does it matter?
LETHE,Dagger Of The Mind,That person no longer exists.
LETHE,Dagger Of The Mind,The woman doctor.
LETHE,Dagger Of The Mind,"She's gone, Doctor Adams."
THERAPIST,Dagger Of The Mind,Quite simple.
THERAPIST,Dagger Of The Mind,"Off on switches, and the large control here changes the strength of the brain neutralising beam."
THERAPIST,Dagger Of The Mind,(to man in treatment chair) You will forget all you have heard.
THERAPIST,Dagger Of The Mind,"To remember any portion of it, any word, will cause you pain, terrible pain, growing more terrible as you fight to remember."
KIRK,Miri,Earth-style distress signal.
KIRK,Miri,SOS.
KIRK,Miri,"We're hundreds of light years from Earth, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Miri,"No
colonies or vessels out this far."
KIRK,Miri,"Not the Earth, another Earth."
KIRK,Miri,Another Earth?
KIRK,Miri,"Hold us in a fixed orbit, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Miri,"Still no response, communications?"
KIRK,Miri,We'll beam down.
KIRK,Miri,Alert security.
KIRK,Miri,"Prepare to transport landing
party to surface."
KIRK,Miri,"We'll land in the vicinity of the distress signals
now being received."
KIRK,Miri,Identical.
KIRK,Miri,"Earth, as it was in the early
1900s."
KIRK,Miri,Mister Spock.
KIRK,Miri,(comes upon child's tricycle)
KIRK,Miri,But with the mind of a child.
KIRK,Miri,"Bones, what is it?"
KIRK,Miri,We want to help you.
KIRK,Miri,What is?
KIRK,Miri,(sound of running) Come on!
KIRK,Miri,How old is this thing?
KIRK,Miri,(sound in the closet) Come out.
KIRK,Miri,We mean you no harm.
KIRK,Miri,(opens door)
KIRK,Miri,I'm not going to hurt you.
KIRK,Miri,I won't hurt you.
KIRK,Miri,I only want to talk to you.
KIRK,Miri,Come on.
KIRK,Miri,I won't hurt you.
KIRK,Miri,Come on.
KIRK,Miri,It's all right.
KIRK,Miri,Come on.
KIRK,Miri,"Take the guards, have a look outside."
KIRK,Miri,"Radioactive readings,
chemical pollutions, any further sign of life."
KIRK,Miri,We didn't do anything like that.
KIRK,Miri,"Well, of course not."
KIRK,Miri,We're here to help.
KIRK,Miri,What happened here?
KIRK,Miri,Where is everybody?
KIRK,Miri,"No, I don't."
KIRK,Miri,Won't you tell me?
KIRK,Miri,What are Grups?
KIRK,Miri,"You said something about the Grups doing bad things, yelling,
hurting, burning."
KIRK,Miri,You're doing fine.
KIRK,Miri,"But what about the children, the Onlies?"
KIRK,Miri,"Didn't the awful things
affect them?"
KIRK,Miri,More of you?
KIRK,Miri,How many?
KIRK,Miri,What's your name?
KIRK,Miri,Miri.
KIRK,Miri,A pretty name for a pretty young woman.
KIRK,Miri,Very pretty.
KIRK,Miri,Miri said all the adults died.
KIRK,Miri,"There must be records somewhere and answers to some of our
questions."
KIRK,Miri,"Miri, do you know any buildings where the doctors used to
work?"
KIRK,Miri,Will you take me there?
KIRK,Miri,It's important.
KIRK,Miri,Please.
KIRK,Miri,Yes.
KIRK,Miri,It's Jim.
KIRK,Miri,Good.
KIRK,Miri,"I like yours, too."
KIRK,Miri,I like you.
KIRK,Miri,I wouldn't lie to you.
KIRK,Miri,"Why, thank you."
KIRK,Miri,(sees a mark on his hand)
KIRK,Miri,"Yes, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,Miri,"Under no circumstances do I want anyone to
beam down from the ship."
KIRK,Miri,"We can't take any chances with further
contamination."
KIRK,Miri,"My orders still stand, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Miri,"You can help us best by
clearing the computer banks and standing by."
KIRK,Miri,Kirk out.
KIRK,Miri,"Bones, why do
you think the symptoms haven't appeared in Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Miri,"(reading) Intermediate experimentation report project on life
prolongation."
KIRK,Miri,All the adults are dead.
KIRK,Miri,Only the children are left alive.
KIRK,Miri,At least they have up to now.
KIRK,Miri,That would explain why there are no adults.
KIRK,Miri,Who die when they enter adolescence.
KIRK,Miri,Loneliness?
KIRK,Miri,"I don't know, curiosity?"
KIRK,Miri,"I think children have an
instinctive need for adults."
KIRK,Miri,They want to be told right and wrong.
KIRK,Miri,(to redshirts) Try again.
KIRK,Miri,See if you can find anything outside.
KIRK,Miri,"(to Miri) Hey, clean up that desk for me, will you?"
KIRK,Miri,Thank you.
KIRK,Miri,"That would certainly answer the question of what happened to
their parents."
KIRK,Miri,"I wouldn't examine that dream too closely, Yeoman."
KIRK,Miri,"It might not
turn out to be very pretty."
KIRK,Miri,I don't think so.
KIRK,Miri,There's no adult interpretation.
KIRK,Miri,"I think we're dealing with
children."
KIRK,Miri,"Immensely old perhaps, but nonetheless children."
KIRK,Miri,We've got to do something about the others.
KIRK,Miri,You couldn't get close to the other kids?
KIRK,Miri,I'm going to try.
KIRK,Miri,Miri?
KIRK,Miri,Come here.
KIRK,Miri,"You want to go someplace with
me?"
KIRK,Miri,Dead.
KIRK,Miri,I don't understand it.
KIRK,Miri,My phaser wasn't set to kill.
KIRK,Miri,"We could use some more, if you don't mind."
KIRK,Miri,There couldn't be any doubt about what you found here?
KIRK,Miri,What about Miri?
KIRK,Miri,And you?
KIRK,Miri,The disease doesn't seem to be interested in you.
KIRK,Miri,"Of course, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Miri,We still don't know what we're fighting.
KIRK,Miri,Are You certain about the time we have left?
KIRK,Miri,Is there any possibility
KIRK,Miri,"There's no data, no starting point."
KIRK,Miri,"Janice, take Miri for a walk."
KIRK,Miri,But do you know what they were up to?
KIRK,Miri,You two will have to recreate their thinking.
KIRK,Miri,"If you can isolate
that virus, we'll be able to develop a vaccine."
KIRK,Miri,I know.
KIRK,Miri,The children!
KIRK,Miri,"(all dash out, while Jahn sneaks in and collects
the communicators from the desks)"
KIRK,Miri,Anything?
KIRK,Miri,And you?
KIRK,Miri,(clunk as grate closes)
KIRK,Miri,Haven't you found a thing yet?
KIRK,Miri,(holds her) We're all frightened.
KIRK,Miri,(Miri leaves)
KIRK,Miri,"Never mind that, what did you find?"
KIRK,Miri,"Where is she, Miri?"
KIRK,Miri,"Where is she, Miri?"
KIRK,Miri,Where's Janice?
KIRK,Miri,Where is she?
KIRK,Miri,Has something happened to her?
KIRK,Miri,"No, I don't feel all right!"
KIRK,Miri,None of us feel all right!
KIRK,Miri,"Can't you
see what's going on?"
KIRK,Miri,I've got to find Janice.
KIRK,Miri,"We're trying, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Miri,We're trying very hard.
KIRK,Miri,This is the vaccine?
KIRK,Miri,Did you hear them?
KIRK,Miri,We only have a few hours left.
KIRK,Miri,You've got to care.
KIRK,Miri,"Miri, I'm going to tell you something."
KIRK,Miri,"You,
your friends, all the Onlies are going to get the disease unless we
succeed in what we're doing."
KIRK,Miri,You've seen your friends get it.
KIRK,Miri,Not sometimes.
KIRK,Miri,"All the times, Miri!"
KIRK,Miri,"As soon as you start growing
up the way you are."
KIRK,Miri,"Don't you know why you don't like to play games
anymore, why you don't see your friends the way you used to?"
KIRK,Miri,"It's
because you're becoming a young woman, and the moment you become a
young woman, you get the disease."
KIRK,Miri,All of you.
KIRK,Miri,"All the time, Miri!"
KIRK,Miri,It's happening to you right now!
KIRK,Miri,Look at it.
KIRK,Miri,"Look at it, Miri, it's in you!"
KIRK,Miri,Listen to me.
KIRK,Miri,Listen to me!
KIRK,Miri,This isn't a game.
KIRK,Miri,It never was a game.
KIRK,Miri,Listen to me!
KIRK,Miri,"You've got our communicators, the boxes we talk
into."
KIRK,Miri,We need them to talk to the ship.
KIRK,Miri,No blah blah blah!
KIRK,Miri,"Because if we don't talk to the ship, if you
don't help us, there won't be any games anymore."
KIRK,Miri,"There won't be
anything."
KIRK,Miri,"Nothing, no Grups, no Onlies, nobody left forever and ever."
KIRK,Miri,Now listen to me.
KIRK,Miri,You've got to help us before it's too late.
KIRK,Miri,"Let
Janice go."
KIRK,Miri,Give me those communicators before it's too late.
KIRK,Miri,You've seen your friends change one by one as they grew up.
KIRK,Miri,"Did
you ever see one of them not change?"
KIRK,Miri,"One by one, they got the disease,
and they became like,
Iike those creatures you're afraid of, like Louise."
KIRK,Miri,"One by one they
changed and got the disease."
KIRK,Miri,"The disease like I've got, like Miri has."
KIRK,Miri,You understand what I'm talking about.
KIRK,Miri,You're not babies.
KIRK,Miri,"We can help
you!"
KIRK,Miri,(bleeding) It's waiting for you.
KIRK,Miri,"It may only be a matter of
months."
KIRK,Miri,Look at my arms!
KIRK,Miri,"That's what's going to happen to you unless you
let me help you."
KIRK,Miri,And the little ones.
KIRK,Miri,"What's going to happen to them after you've
gone, after you've turned into creatures like Louise?"
KIRK,Miri,"Oh, they'll still
be here, but not for long, because the food's all gone."
KIRK,Miri,"You've eaten
it."
KIRK,Miri,"Maybe six months left, that's all,
and then nothing left to eat, nobody left to take care of them."
KIRK,Miri,"They'll
die, too."
KIRK,Miri,"All right, you want a foolie?"
KIRK,Miri,All right.
KIRK,Miri,"I dare you, I
double-dare you."
KIRK,Miri,Look at the blood on my face.
KIRK,Miri,Now look at your hands.
KIRK,Miri,Blood on your hands.
KIRK,Miri,Now who's doing the hurting?
KIRK,Miri,"Not the Grups, it's
you hurting, yelling, maybe killing, just like the Grups you remember
and creatures you're afraid of."
KIRK,Miri,"You're acting like them, and you're
going to be just like them unless you let me help you."
KIRK,Miri,"I'm a Grup, and
I want to help you."
KIRK,Miri,"I'm begging you, let me help you or there won't be
anything left at all."
KIRK,Miri,Please.
KIRK,Miri,"(with children and communicators) Three hours, eleven minutes
left."
KIRK,Miri,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Miri,Keep this channel open.
KIRK,Miri,"Clear your
computers."
KIRK,Miri,What happened to him?
KIRK,Miri,Look at his face.
KIRK,Miri,"Just children, three hundred years old and more."
KIRK,Miri,"I've already
contacted Space Central."
KIRK,Miri,"They'll send teachers, advisers."
KIRK,Miri,They'll be all right.
KIRK,Miri,Yes.
KIRK,Miri,"I never get involved with older women, Yeoman."
KIRK,Miri,Mister Spock?
KIRK,Miri,Full ahead.
KIRK,Miri,Warp factor one.
FARRELL,Miri,"I've answered it on all frequencies, sir."
FARRELL,Miri,They don't reply.
FARRELL,Miri,Directly ahead.
FARRELL,Miri,Definitely an Earth-style signal.
FARRELL,Miri,"None, Captain."
FARRELL,Miri,"Yes, Doctor."
FARRELL,Miri,Captain Kirk?
FARRELL,Miri,"I've got volunteers standing by ready to
help you, sir."
FARRELL,Miri,"But Captain, if you become too ill to"
FARRELL,Miri,Mister Spock.
FARRELL,Miri,Here are those figures you asked for.
FARRELL,Miri,"Twelve to the tenth
power."
FARRELL,Miri,Metabolic rate seventy two percent.
FARRELL,Miri,"Production of nucleic acids
reduced to thirty three percent of normal."
FARRELL,Miri,"Conventional chronological
progression one hundred by three point six."
FARRELL,Miri,"Data has been fed into the computers,
Mister Spock."
FARRELL,Miri,Stand by.
FARRELL,Miri,"Landing party, this is the Enterprise."
FARRELL,Miri,"Computer indicates one hundred seventy hours, Mister
Spock."
SPOCK,Miri,"Not a vessel, a ground source."
SPOCK,Miri,"The third planet in this solar
system, according to my instruments."
SPOCK,Miri,"Measuring the planet now, Captain."
SPOCK,Miri,"It's spheroid-shaped,
circumference twenty four thousand eight hundred seventy four miles."
SPOCK,Miri,Mass six times ten to the twenty first power tons.
SPOCK,Miri,"Mean density five
point five one seven."
SPOCK,Miri,"Atmosphere oxygen, nitrogen."
SPOCK,Miri,"Affirmative, Captain."
SPOCK,Miri,"More the, er, mid-1900s I would say, Captain, approximately
1960."
SPOCK,Miri,"Readings indicate that natural deterioration has been taking
place on this planet for at least several centuries."
SPOCK,Miri,"Not conclusive, Yeoman."
SPOCK,Miri,"The evidence would suggest that the
distress signal is automated."
SPOCK,Miri,"Definitely humanoid, in spite of the distortion."
SPOCK,Miri,About three hundred years.
SPOCK,Miri,"Right, Captain."
SPOCK,Miri,Guards!
SPOCK,Miri,Cover me.
SPOCK,Miri,"Children, Captain."
SPOCK,Miri,Lots of them.
SPOCK,Miri,"We couldn't
begin to get close to them."
SPOCK,Miri,"They just seemed to scurry away, like
animals."
SPOCK,Miri,Only children.
SPOCK,Miri,Being a red-blooded human obviously has its disadvantages.
SPOCK,Miri,"Now
there you have a museum piece, Doctor."
SPOCK,Miri,"(referring to microscope) Lens
type, manually operated, light-activated."
SPOCK,Miri,"Progress report, genetics section, Life Prolongation Project."
SPOCK,Miri,"This was three hundred years ago, Captain."
SPOCK,Miri,But children become adults.
SPOCK,Miri,"Doctor, there are certain glandular changes which take place
upon entering puberty, are there not?"
SPOCK,Miri,"Is it not possible that these children here, as they enter
puberty, contract the disease?"
SPOCK,Miri,It's illogical.
SPOCK,Miri,It does not follow.
SPOCK,Miri,"All the adults on this
planet died three hundred years ago, but there are children in the
streets."
SPOCK,Miri,"There may be other emotions at work in this case, Captain."
SPOCK,Miri,She's becoming a woman.
SPOCK,Miri,Spock here.
SPOCK,Miri,"Acknowledged, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,Miri,I have their calculations now.
SPOCK,Miri,"According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought
they were accomplishing, a person would age only one month for every
one hundred years of real time."
SPOCK,Miri,"Exactly, Yeoman."
SPOCK,Miri,"Evidently through some miscalculation, this
virus annihilated the entire adult population in a very short period,
leaving only the children."
SPOCK,Miri,Could very well be immensely old.
SPOCK,Miri,"Difficult, if we can't even get a glimpse of them."
SPOCK,Miri,Impossible.
SPOCK,Miri,"They know the area too well, like mice."
SPOCK,Miri,"Is at least three hundred years older than you are, Yeoman."
SPOCK,Miri,Think about it.
SPOCK,Miri,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,Miri,"This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the
disaster began."
SPOCK,Miri,I disregard these last entries.
SPOCK,Miri,"He said himself he was
too sick, too far gone to be sure he wasn't already mad, and I agree,
but based on the entries he made before that, I know how much time we
have."
SPOCK,Miri,The ship's computers will verify my figures.
SPOCK,Miri,Our guess was correct.
SPOCK,Miri,"They contract the disease as they enter
puberty and their metabolism changes."
SPOCK,Miri,"The notes would indicate it
doesn't become acute for a month or so."
SPOCK,Miri,"I estimate she has perhaps five
or six weeks left."
SPOCK,Miri,"The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the
disease."
SPOCK,Miri,I am a carrier.
SPOCK,Miri,"Whatever happens, I can't go back to the ship,
and I do want to go back to the ship, Captain."
SPOCK,Miri,I presume my calculations are correct.
SPOCK,Miri,Spock here.
SPOCK,Miri,"Verified, Captain."
SPOCK,Miri,We have seven days.
SPOCK,Miri,"Unfortunately, they weren't successful."
SPOCK,Miri,We've seen the results.
SPOCK,Miri,"No, nothing."
SPOCK,Miri,"Communicators, Captain, they're gone."
SPOCK,Miri,"The nitrogen cycle, it has to be."
SPOCK,Miri,That is a very good question.
SPOCK,Miri,"That's not all, Captain."
SPOCK,Miri,We've got to find those communicators.
SPOCK,Miri,"We've got to have those communicators, Jim."
SPOCK,Miri,"Without them, it could be a beaker full of death."
SPOCK,Miri,We must.
SPOCK,Miri,The vaccine could be fatal.
SPOCK,Miri,Bickering is pointless.
SPOCK,Miri,I'll check on the Captain's progress.
SPOCK,Miri,Not yet.
SPOCK,Miri,He injected himself with the vaccine.
SPOCK,Miri,"He was unconscious when I
found him."
SPOCK,Miri,The blemishes are fading.
SPOCK,Miri,They're fading.
SPOCK,Miri,"Who will understand
the medical mind?"
SPOCK,Miri,Captain?
SPOCK,Miri,"Warp factor one, Captain."
RAND,Miri,Earth!
RAND,Miri,But where is everybody?
RAND,Miri,You mean there's no one alive?
RAND,Miri,"We won't hurt you, sweetheart."
RAND,Miri,We're your friends.
RAND,Miri,"No, shh!"
RAND,Miri,But we will.
RAND,Miri,Grownups.
RAND,Miri,So that's what it was.
RAND,Miri,"One thing, Captain."
RAND,Miri,"If she were a wild animal ever since she's
been a little girl, how do you explain that she wants to stay with us?"
RAND,Miri,One hundred years and only one month?
RAND,Miri,But that means these children
RAND,Miri,Children who never age.
RAND,Miri,"Eternal childhood, filled with play, no
responsibilities."
RAND,Miri,It's almost like a dream.
RAND,Miri,Do you suppose she knows?
RAND,Miri,"If they're as old as Spock claims, they must have some idea of
what's happening."
RAND,Miri,That little girl
RAND,Miri,"Yes, sir."
RAND,Miri,(as Kirk pushes past and makes her drop flasks) No!
RAND,Miri,No!
RAND,Miri,No!
RAND,Miri,"(runs
out, Kirk follows, then Miri)"
RAND,Miri,"I'm upset, so upset."
RAND,Miri,"Back on the ship, I used
to try to get you to look at my legs."
RAND,Miri,"Captain, look at my legs."
RAND,Miri,(covered in blotches)
RAND,Miri,There's a chance!
RAND,Miri,It's not funny.
RAND,Miri,What are you going to do with me?
RAND,Miri,(sees boy with club coming up behind him) Captain.
RAND,Miri,They were just children.
RAND,Miri,"Simply to leave them
there with a medical team"
RAND,Miri,Miri.
RAND,Miri,"She really loved you, you know."
MCCOY,Miri,"Now, this is marvellous."
MCCOY,Miri,"the most horrible conglomeration of
antique architecture I've ever seen."
MCCOY,Miri,Of course somebody will fix it.
MCCOY,Miri,A seizure of some type.
MCCOY,Miri,It's dead.
MCCOY,Miri,It's incredible.
MCCOY,Miri,Its metabolic rate.
MCCOY,Miri,"It's impossibly high as if it's burning
itself up, almost as if it aged a century in just the past few minutes."
MCCOY,Miri,"I wonder what happened to her, that she should be so terrified
of us."
MCCOY,Miri,Foolie?
MCCOY,Miri,You said the Grups got sick.
MCCOY,Miri,"Is that why there aren't any of
them around?"
MCCOY,Miri,"A plague, Captain."
MCCOY,Miri,That could explain a lot of it.
MCCOY,Miri,That creature which attacked us was certainly no child.
MCCOY,Miri,"Perhaps
it died of the disease the girl's talking about."
MCCOY,Miri,A veritable zoo of bacteria.
MCCOY,Miri,"Beam down a
biocomputer and a portable electronic microscope."
MCCOY,Miri,"If I'm dealing with
viruses, I'll need better equipment than I have here."
MCCOY,Miri,I don't know.
MCCOY,Miri,"Probably the little bugs or whatever they are have
no appetite for green blood."
MCCOY,Miri,"Spare me the analysis, Mister Spock, please."
MCCOY,Miri,"It is enough that
it works."
MCCOY,Miri,Life prolongation.
MCCOY,Miri,"Didn't have much luck, did they?"
MCCOY,Miri,Tubular with extreme multiplicability.
MCCOY,Miri,Appear to have affinity for nucleic acids.
MCCOY,Miri,Give me what you have.
MCCOY,Miri,Of course.
MCCOY,Miri,It changes the entire body system.
MCCOY,Miri,You know that.
MCCOY,Miri,"Of
course you know that."
MCCOY,Miri,Why?
MCCOY,Miri,"Glandular, post-pubescent."
MCCOY,Miri,Could be.
MCCOY,Miri,But how do they keep the line going?
MCCOY,Miri,"She likes you, Jim."
MCCOY,Miri,Answers it very well.
MCCOY,Miri,"A few days ago or a week ago that creature that attacked us
could have been just like Miri."
MCCOY,Miri,"A child entering puberty on this planet
means a death sentence."
MCCOY,Miri,"Only a matter of time before we all go mad, destroy each other,
till the last of us finally destroys himself."
MCCOY,Miri,What about us?
MCCOY,Miri,"No, but we know what it is and how fast it does it."
MCCOY,Miri,"It's
progressing."
MCCOY,Miri,We'll begin to feel it inside soon.
MCCOY,Miri,"Intense fever, great
pain in the extremities, fuzziness of vision."
MCCOY,Miri,"Of course, those are the
early symptoms."
MCCOY,Miri,There'll be more.
MCCOY,Miri,I think I've found it.
MCCOY,Miri,Only one half intact.
MCCOY,Miri,More or less.
MCCOY,Miri,"The idea was to create a new series of diseases, a
chain reaction of viruses meant essentially to extend the life of the
human cell immeasurably."
MCCOY,Miri,"Is that all, Captain?"
MCCOY,Miri,"We have five days, you know."
MCCOY,Miri,"Jim, We've absolutely got to have those communicators."
MCCOY,Miri,"Without
them, we don't have the computers, and without the computers, we don't
have a chance."
MCCOY,Miri,Would you like to take a crack at it?
MCCOY,Miri,"Jim, I found something!"
MCCOY,Miri,"The last slide I examined, I failed to make
the necessary adjustment."
MCCOY,Miri,The slowing down of my own responses
MCCOY,Miri,"The disease, Captain, the one they created three hundred years
ago."
MCCOY,Miri,A chance.
MCCOY,Miri,"At least it's a race now, and we've just wasted a
minute."
MCCOY,Miri,It looks right.
MCCOY,Miri,"But the question is, what's the dosage?"
MCCOY,Miri,That's not good enough!
MCCOY,Miri,"This could be it, but we can't test it
without the ship's computers."
MCCOY,Miri,That's what the computers will tell us.
MCCOY,Miri,"We can't wait for those communicators any
longer."
MCCOY,Miri,The disease certainly is.
MCCOY,Miri,How long do we have left?
MCCOY,Miri,"Hours,
minutes?"
MCCOY,Miri,How much longer do you want to wait?
MCCOY,Miri,Spock!
MCCOY,Miri,"And truant officers, I presume."
TEENAGER,Miri,Mine!
TEENAGER,Miri,Mine!
TEENAGER,Miri,(attacks McCoy) Mine!
TEENAGER,Miri,Mine!
TEENAGER,Miri,Mine!
TEENAGER,Miri,Mine!
TEENAGER,Miri,Mine!
TEENAGER,Miri,Mine!
TEENAGER,Miri,"(Kirk drags him off and hits him several times) It's, it's broke."
TEENAGER,Miri,Somebody broke it.
TEENAGER,Miri,Fix.
TEENAGER,Miri,"Somebody, please fix."
TEENAGER,Miri,Liar!
TEENAGER,Miri,"Never, never, never, never, never, never, never!"
MIRI,Miri,"Don't hurt me, please."
MIRI,Miri,"No, please, don't."
MIRI,Miri,I didn't do anything.
MIRI,Miri,"No, please don't."
MIRI,Miri,"No, don't."
MIRI,Miri,Don't hurt.
MIRI,Miri,"Don't, please."
MIRI,Miri,Don't hurt me.
MIRI,Miri,"But I remember the things you Grups did, burning, yelling,
hurting people."
MIRI,Miri,You're not going to hurt?
MIRI,Miri,Grups don't help.
MIRI,Miri,You know.
MIRI,Miri,"You got a foolie, is that it, and you want me to play, but I
can't."
MIRI,Miri,I don't know the rules.
MIRI,Miri,I've got to know the rules.
MIRI,Miri,"A game, you know."
MIRI,Miri,You can't play a game without rules.
MIRI,Miri,"Even Grups
ought to know that."
MIRI,Miri,You are.
MIRI,Miri,"They will, when Onlies get old."
MIRI,Miri,That was when they started to get sick in the before time.
MIRI,Miri,"We
hid, then they were gone."
MIRI,Miri,Am I doing all right?
MIRI,Miri,Yes.
MIRI,Miri,"They died, but that was after the awful things."
MIRI,Miri,Of course not.
MIRI,Miri,"We're here, aren't we?"
MIRI,Miri,All there are.
MIRI,Miri,Miri.
MIRI,Miri,Pretty?
MIRI,Miri,"Yes, I know that."
MIRI,Miri,Them and their pills and things.
MIRI,Miri,That's a bad place.
MIRI,Miri,All right.
MIRI,Miri,"Do you have a name, too?"
MIRI,Miri,I like that name.
MIRI,Miri,Do you really?
MIRI,Miri,"I wouldn't lie to you, either, Jim."
MIRI,Miri,"I remember the Grups, but
you're nice."
MIRI,Miri,You're different.
MIRI,Miri,It's already starting.
MIRI,Miri,I knew it would.
MIRI,Miri,"Just like it did with the
Grups."
MIRI,Miri,"It'll spread all over you, and you'll yell, and you'll try to
hurt everybody and then you'll die."
MIRI,Miri,I knew it would!
MIRI,Miri,I knew it would!
MIRI,Miri,It spreads real fast.
MIRI,Miri,I know.
MIRI,Miri,"When you're old, it covers you like
anything."
MIRI,Miri,"All right, Jim."
MIRI,Miri,Sure.
MIRI,Miri,"(leave, holding hands)"
MIRI,Miri,Her name was Louise.
MIRI,Miri,"She was just a little bit older than I am
when it happened."
MIRI,Miri,"Oh, Jim."
MIRI,Miri,(she hugs him)
MIRI,Miri,"(sharpening pencils) Are these enough, Jim?"
MIRI,Miri,"No, I don't mind."
MIRI,Miri,I know.
MIRI,Miri,I know.
MIRI,Miri,Don't you think I've heard them talk?
MIRI,Miri,"They have
such little time to do this dumb thing of theirs, this baninski thing."
MIRI,Miri,If we get her away.
MIRI,Miri,"that Yeoman, that's one person less to start off
with."
MIRI,Miri,It's easy.
MIRI,Miri,"She's always asking me about the youngest little
Onlies, little ones."
MIRI,Miri,"What if they get sick, who takes care of them?"
MIRI,Miri,"Do
they have enough to eat?"
MIRI,Miri,Where do they sleep?
MIRI,Miri,"I'll just tell her one of
you fell down and got hurt."
MIRI,Miri,"All right, you."
MIRI,Miri,"Not one, two."
MIRI,Miri,Because he'll try to find her.
MIRI,Miri,The Captain.
MIRI,Miri,"He'll try to find her, but he won't."
MIRI,Miri,"Mister
Lovey-dovey."
MIRI,Miri,What's the matter with you?
MIRI,Miri,How should I know?
MIRI,Miri,Don't you feel all right?
MIRI,Miri,"Jim, I don't want anything to happen to you."
MIRI,Miri,I don't care.
MIRI,Miri,Sometimes it happens.
MIRI,Miri,That's not true.
MIRI,Miri,It just happens sometimes.
MIRI,Miri,No!
MIRI,Miri,No!
MIRI,Miri,No!
MIRI,Miri,I know.
MIRI,Miri,No.
MIRI,Miri,Listen to him.
MIRI,Miri,I did.
MIRI,Miri,Why do you think I brought him here?
MIRI,Miri,"Tell them, Jim."
MIRI,Miri,"No, please."
MIRI,Miri,No!
MIRI,Miri,"(the other children join in as the little blonde
girl watches, smiling)"
MIRI,Miri,Listen to him.
MIRI,Miri,He's telling the truth.
MIRI,Miri,"Look at my arm, Jahn."
MIRI,Miri,It's happening to me.
MIRI,Miri,"He's telling the
truth."
MIRI,Miri,Of course it is.
CHILDREN,Miri,Nyah na nyah.

JAHN,Miri,Miri is with them!
JAHN,Miri,Why?
JAHN,Miri,Why?
JAHN,Miri,"I don't, I don't know."
JAHN,Miri,I know what we've got to do.
JAHN,Miri,"There are
more of them than we see."
JAHN,Miri,"Somewhere, up in the sky, maybe, somewhere."
JAHN,Miri,They talk to each other all the time.
JAHN,Miri,You know Grups.
JAHN,Miri,"You know what
they do, the hurting, the killing."
JAHN,Miri,"That's right, the way it was in the before time."
JAHN,Miri,"They talk to the
other Grups with these little boxes."
JAHN,Miri,"Now, if they didn't have those
little boxes, they'd be all alone, huh?"
JAHN,Miri,No!
JAHN,Miri,"It's not a game, it's real."
JAHN,Miri,"They're dangerous, they're Grups."
JAHN,Miri,Don't you understand?
JAHN,Miri,"(sees Kirk and Miri approach the building) All right, let's hide!"
JAHN,Miri,"That would be some foolie, Miri, but do you
think it would work?"
JAHN,Miri,"But Grups, they know things and all that."
JAHN,Miri,"You know, I bet they'll
be able to do it with one person less."
JAHN,Miri,"No, you got the wrong game."
JAHN,Miri,"A teacher, I told you."
JAHN,Miri,"Now, what does
a teacher say, huh?"
JAHN,Miri,It's a foolie.
JAHN,Miri,You think I'd tell you?
JAHN,Miri,"Miri, you're not supposed to be here."
JAHN,Miri,"What's the matter, something go wrong?"
JAHN,Miri,"Okay, then."
JAHN,Miri,"Don't just stand there in the doorway, come on in."
JAHN,Miri,"You listen, Miri."
JAHN,Miri,"Tell'em, Jim."
JAHN,Miri,"Tell'em, Jim."
JAHN,Miri,No yelling in the classroom!
JAHN,Miri,"Look at him, a very bad citizen."
JAHN,Miri,You're the teacher.
JAHN,Miri,He's funny.
JAHN,Miri,He thinks he's funny.
JAHN,Miri,They're Grups!
JAHN,Miri,"Is this supposed to be a good thing, Miri?"
HEAD BOY,Miri,"RED  What's she going to do, Jahn?"
HEAD BOY,Miri,"RED  I remember, Jahn, the way it was."
HEAD BOY,Miri,RED  But they don't see us.
HEAD BOY,Miri,We hide.
HEAD BOY,Miri,Olly olly oxen free!
HEAD BOY,Miri,RED  Me.
HEAD BOY,Miri,Say it's me.
HEAD BOY,Miri,RED  Who?
HEAD BOY,Miri,"Who will, Miri?"
HEAD BOY,Miri,RED  Lovey-dovey.
HEAD BOY,Miri,Bonk bonk on the head.
HEAD BOY,Miri,Bonk bonk!
HEAD BOY,Miri,bonk bonk!
HEAD BOY,Miri,"RED  Blah, blah, blah!"
HEAD BOY,Miri,RED  Yeah.
HEAD BOY,Miri,"Study, study, study, or bonk bonk, bad kid."
HEAD BOY,Miri,(children all applaud)
HEAD BOY,Miri,RED  I'm the police.
HEAD BOY,Miri,Bonk bonk unless you're good.
HEAD BOY,Miri,RED  I got two jobs.
HEAD BOY,Miri,Bonk bonk!
HEAD BOY,Miri,RED  Blah blah blah!
HEAD BOY,Miri,RED  Naughty Grup.
HEAD BOY,Miri,(starts hitting Kirk) Bonk bonk!
HEAD BOY,Miri,Bonk bonk!
HEAD BOY,Miri,RED  Bonk bonk!
HEAD BOY,Miri,Get him!
HEAD BOY,Miri,RED  Bonk bonk!
HEAD BOY,Miri,Hit him!
MASKED BOY,Miri,Jahn!
MASKED BOY,Miri,"But how, Miri?"
MASKED BOY,Miri,"If they're so busy, if they're going to have
the big emergency, how are you going to get her away?"
BLONDE GIRL,Miri,Call the police!
GALLOWAY,Miri,"Is he dead, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Interesting.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",An Arcturian Macbeth.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","You mean to tell me you've called me three
light years off my course just to accuse an actor of being Kodos?"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",You said you discovered a new food concentrate.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","What am I
supposed to put in my log, that you lied?"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","That you diverted a starship
with false information?"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","You're not only in trouble, you've put me in
trouble, too."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Kodos is dead.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Tom, the authorities closed the book on that case years ago."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Martha, you tell him."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Kodos is dead.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I'm satisfied of that.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",He's dead.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","And I have to get back to my ship and figure out how I'm going to
enter all this in my log."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Tom.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Martha.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",History files.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Subject, former Governor Kodos of Tarsus Four,
also known as Kodos the Executioner."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","After that, background on actor
Anton Karidian."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Stop.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Information on Anton Karidian.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Stop.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Give comparative identification between actor Karidian and
Governor Kodos."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Give information on actor Karidian prior to Kodos' death.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Photograph Kodos.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","(an image of a red-haired man with a beard
comes on the monitor) Photograph Karidian."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","(the grey-haired man with a
small moustache) Now photograph both."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","You know Doctor Leighton, don't you?"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Would you say
he's given to fantasy?"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",With a very long memory.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",We'll delay departure for a time.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","I'm beaming back down to the
planet."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Where's Tom?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",The others are on the patio.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Why not?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I saw your performance today.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","May I extend my
appreciation?"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Captain James Kirk, Starship Enterprise."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","I had hoped to meet your father, here, tonight, personally."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",An actor turning away his admirers?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Very unusual.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Then I'll talk to Lady Macbeth.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","So, Lady Macbeth."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Interesting.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",What's your next move?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",She's a good ship.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",(takes a glass from a passing tray) Thank you.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",You were very impressive as Lady Macbeth.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Very impressive.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Lenore.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I'd like to see you again.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Not necessarily.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","You don't have a schedule now, do you?"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Exactly.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Good.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I'll make our apologies to our hostess.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","I'll meet you
outside."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",About what?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",It's Tom Leighton.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",He's dead.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I don't know.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I'll try and find out.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Put me through to Captain Jon Daily of the AstraI Queen on orbit
station, and put it on scramble."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Can you do me a favour?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Don't make your pick-up here.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I'll pick them up.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","And if there's any trouble, it'll be my
responsibility."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Just keep this between the two of us and accept my thanks.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Over
and out."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Transporter room, ready to beam up."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I think we're due for a pick-up.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Tell her to come up to the Bridge, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I'm the Captain.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you I arranged it.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Can't you make other arrangements?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",It'd be a shame if that happened.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Well.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",The regulations are very clear about taking on passengers.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",What have you got to trade?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",You make it sound very interesting.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","The crew has been on patrol
for a long time."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",They could use a break in the monotony.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",You've got me backed into a corner.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","The men would never forgive
me if I deprived them of your performance, and your presence."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Mister Spock, prepare to leave orbit as soon as the Karidian
company is aboard the ship."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Benecia Colony.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","If my memory needs refreshing, Mister Spock, I'll ask you for it."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","In the meantime, follow my orders."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Mister Spock, ETA the Benecia Colony."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Data on question submitted to personnel files.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Stop.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Give list.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Stop.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Is that star service Lieutenant Kevin Riley?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Stop.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Lieutenant Kevin Riley in communications, I wish to have him
transferred down to the engineering decks."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I'm sending him back.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","I don't wish to discuss it, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Please follow my
orders."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",It was illogical for him to bring those players aboard.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",This is the observation deck.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","That's the flight deck down there
with the shuttle craft."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Isn't it?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Anything.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","If I had ordered soft lights, I'd also have arranged for music
and flowers."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Unfortunately, it isn't so."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","On the Enterprise, we try to
duplicate earth conditions of night and day as closely as possible."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",It's very old.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Come from a very human source.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",You can count on it.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I'd rather talk about you.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","You must have wanted to perform since
you first saw your father act."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",When was that?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Tell me about it.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",What would you like to know?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Worlds may change, galaxies disintegrate, but a woman always
remains a woman."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Come.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Will he make it?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","All right, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Let's have it.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",All right.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Aren't you getting a little out of line, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","My
personal business,"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",You think that happened?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I don't like anyone meddling in my private affairs.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Not even my
second in command."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","I know what he's doing, and I don't like it."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",And you also know that nothing is proven.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I'm not.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I'm interested in justice.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","No, I'm not sure."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I wish I was.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","I've done things I've never done
before."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I've placed my command in jeopardy.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","From here on I've got to
determine whether or not Karidian is Kodos."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",You sound certain.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I wish I could be.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Before I accuse a man of
that, I've got to be."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","I saw him once, twenty years ago."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Men change.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Memory changes.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Look at him now, he's an actor."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","He can change his
appearance."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",No.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Logic is not enough.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","I've got to feel my way, make
absolutely sure."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","No, but they may rest easier."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Doc isn't sure it was a murder attempt.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Besides, I have an idea
may prove"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",A phaser.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",This is the Captain.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",There's a phaser on overload in my quarters.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","If it blows, it'll take out the entire deck."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Evacuate all personnel in
this quadrant."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Double Red Alert.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","(now starts searching himself) You get
out of here."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Go on.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Block off this section.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Hurry.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I'll find it.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","(barging in without knocking) We're overdue
for our talk, aren't we?"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","A moment ago, we narrowly averted an explosion which would have
destroyed several decks of this ship."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Before that, someone tried to
poison one of my crewmen."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I'm sure you are.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Are you Kodos?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I asked you a question.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I do.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",You're an actor now.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",What were you twenty years ago?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",So was I.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",But I remember.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Let's see if you do.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Read this into
that communicator on the wall."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","It will be recorded and compared to a
piece of Kodos' voice film we have in our files."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","The test is virtually
infallible."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","It will tell us whether you're Karidian, or Kodos the
Executioner."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",(switches on comm.)
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Ready for voice test.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Disguising your
voice will make no difference."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I remember the words.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",I wrote them down.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","You said them like you
knew them."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",You hardly glanced at the paper.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Are you sure?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Are you sure you didn't act this role out in front
of a captive audience whom you blasted out of existence without mercy?"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",We've armed man with tools.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",The striving for greatness continues.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",But Kodos
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Or is.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","All I understand is that four thousand people were needlessly
butchered."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",But he didn't.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",And history has made its judgment.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Those beautiful words, well acted, change nothing."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","There are no previous records to Anton Karidian prior to twenty
years ago."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","If I had gotten everything I wanted, you might not walk out of
this room alive."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",In the beginning perhaps.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","But later, I wanted it to be more than
that."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","If he is Kodos, then I've shown him more mercy than he deserves."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","And if he isn't, then we'll let you off at Benecia, and no harm done."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Who do I have to be?
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","But not an exact match, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","We're dealing with a man's
life."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",No machine can make that decision.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Yes, Doctor."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","You've made your point, Doctor."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",This is the Captain.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Security two alert.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Find and restrain
Lieutenant Kevin Riley."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","He's armed and possibly headed towards the
ship's theatre."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Riley, get back to the Sickbay."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",You could be wrong.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Don't throw away your life on a mistake.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",It's an order.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Give me the weapon.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Now get back to Sickbay.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Go on.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Bright as a blade.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Come with me, both of you."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",The play is over.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",It's been over for twenty years.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",By killing seven innocent men.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",Guard.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King",You'll never get off the ship.
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Stand by, Mister Leslie."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","All channels cleared, Uhura?"
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Whenever you're ready, Mister Leslie."
KIRK,"The
Conscience of the King","Ahead warp factor one, Mister Leslie."
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",(a man with an eyepatch) Watch him.
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",Watch Macbeth.
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",That voice.
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",He's back.
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",That man on the stage.
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King","I'm certain of
it."
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",That's Kodos the Executioner.
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",He is Kodos.
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",I'm sure of it.
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",I did it to trap Kodos!
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",Is he?
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",Is anyone sure?
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",A body burned beyond recognition?
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",Then let's reopen it.
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King","Jim, four thousand people were
butchered."
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King","Well, I'm not."
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",I remember him.
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",That voice.
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King","The bloody thing
he did."
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King","Jim, Jim, I need your help."
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King","There were only eight or nine of
us who actually saw Kodos."
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King","I was one, you were another."
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King","If he's to be
exposed,"
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King","Then it will be a ghost Martha and I receive in our home
tonight."
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King",I invited the entire company to a cocktail party.
LEIGHTON,"The
Conscience of the King","I have to be
sure."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",(as Lady M) Is he dead?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Speak.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Is King Duncan dead?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",I take it you're the welcoming committee.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","(referring to his
glass) Is that for me?"
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","My father will be delighted, Mister."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Mister?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",We are honoured.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","I'm sorry, Captain Kirk."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",He has a rigid rule about that.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","He
never sees anyone personally, and he never attends parties."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Karidian is a most unusual man.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",You saw Macbeth.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","That was my
father."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",So.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Captain of the Enterprise.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Interesting.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","We play two performances at Benecia, if the AstraI Queen can
get us there."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Thank you.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",And as Lenore Karidian?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",You mean professionally?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",I think I'd like that.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Unfortunately, we must keep a schedule."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",You mean leave?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",But I've only just arrived.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",And you hate to overstay a welcome.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Why not?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",No.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Just thinking.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","At the party, you were such a brash young man."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Now somehow different.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Not a ship's Captain with all those
people to be strong and confident in front of."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","You know, you're really
very dear, aren't you?"
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","In some ways, very lonely."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Captain Kirk, I didn't think we'd be meeting again so soon."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","No, but it's a delightful thought."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Captain, I'm afraid we need
your help."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",We've been stranded.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","It seems that our transportation has
cancelled out on us."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Yes, but not in time."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","You see, our schedule is like a chain."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",One break and it all collapses.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",If ever we needed a Good Samaritan.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",I appeal to you.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","I'll make a bargain with you, Captain."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Special performance for the crew in exchange for a lift.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Then you'll do it?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Thank you, Captain."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",I'm eternally grateful.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","I'll get the
company ready."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",This means so much to them.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Interesting.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Tell me, Captain Kirk."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Did you order the soft lights especially for the occasion?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Star light, star bright."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","I wish I may, I wish I might."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Do you
remember that, Captain?"
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Almost as old as the stars themselves.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",And this ship.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","All this
power, surging and throbbing, yet under control."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Are you like that,
Captain?"
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","All this power at your command, yet the decisions that you
have to make"
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Are you, Captain?"
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Human?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Tell me about the women in your world, Captain."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",In the beginning.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",That's not fair.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","You haven't answered my question about the
women."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Has the machine changed them?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Made them just people instead of
women?"
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",All this and power too.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","The Caesar of the stars and the
Cleopatra to worship him."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Captain Kirk.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",(to Karidian) You'd better rest now.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","There's a stain of cruelty
on your shining armour, Captain."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","You could have spared him, and me."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","You
talked of using tools."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","I was a tool, wasn't l?"
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","A tool to use against my
father."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Later.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Everything's always later.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Later.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Latest.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Too late.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Too
late, Captain."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","You are like your ship, powerful, and not human."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","There
is no mercy in you."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Captain Kirk.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Who are you to say what harm was done?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","(on stage) Tonight, the Karidian Players
present Hamlet, another in a series of living plays presented in space,
dedicated to the tradition of classic theatre."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Hamlet is a violent play
about violent times when life was cheap and ambition was God."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",It's going beautifully.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",What is it?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",What's wrong?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","No, Father."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",The time will never come.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Tonight, after my
performance, the last two who can harm you will be gone."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",There were nine.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Now there are only two, and they will be gone
as soon as I."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Don't look at me like that.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",What had to be done.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",They had to be silenced.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","No Father, not anymore."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","I'm strong, Father."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",It's nothing.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",We'll be ready.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Don't you see?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",All the ghosts are dead.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","I've
buried them."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",There's no more blood on your hands.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","But you're safe now, Father."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",I've saved you.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Now, no one can
touch you."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Not even Captain Kirk.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",See Caesar come?
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","He's awed by your
greatness, your shining brightness."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Bright as a blade before it is
stained with blood."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Of course.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",After the play.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Stop it, Father!"
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",You have nothing to justify.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",I did it for you.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",I've saved you.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",They weren't innocent!
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",They were dangerous!
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","I would have killed
a world to save him!"
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","The play, Captain."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",He must go on.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",This is the great Karidian.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",You cannot deny him his last performance!
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","It will become a floating tomb, drifting through space with the
soul of the great Karidian giving performances at every star he
touches."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","(Kirk moves towards her) I know how to use this, Captain."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","Caesar, beware the ides of March."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Father.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",Father!
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","O, proud, death!"
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","What feast is toward in thine
eternal cell, that thou, such a prince at a shot so bloodily hast
struck?"
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","The curtain, the curtain rises."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",It rises.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","There's no time to
sleep."
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",The play.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King",The play.
LENORE,"The
Conscience of the King","The play's the thing, wherein we'll catch
the conscience of the king."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my
hands."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",Pluck out mine eyes!
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","I hoped you would have respected my privacy, Captain."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",I am sorry to hear that.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",Do you believe that I am?
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Then I am Kodos, if it pleases you to believe so."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","I am an
actor."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",I play many parts.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Younger, Captain."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",Much younger.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","(reading) The revolution is successful, but survival depends
on drastic measures."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Your continued existence represents a threat to
the well-being of society."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","(stops looking at the paper) Your lives
means slow death to the more valued members of the colony."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Therefore I
have no alternative but to sentence you to death."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Your execution is so
ordered."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Signed, Kodos, governor of Tarsus Four."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",I learn my parts very quickly.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","I find your use of the word mercy strangely inappropriate,
Captain."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Here you stand, the perfect symbol of our technical society."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Mechanised, electronicised, and not very human."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","You've done away with
humanity, the striving of man to achieve greatness through his own
resources."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Kodos, whoever he was"
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",Or is.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",Kodos made a decision of life and death.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Some had to
die that others might live."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","You're a man of decision, Captain."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","You
ought to understand that."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",In order to save four thousand others.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","And if the supply
ships hadn't come earlier than expected, this Kodos of yours might have
gone down in history as a great hero."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","If you're so sure that I'm Kodos, why not kill me now?"
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Let
bloody vengeance take its final course!"
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","And see what difference it
makes to this universe of yours."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",I suppose not.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","They're merely tools, like this ship of yours."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",Blood thins.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",The body fails.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","One is finally grateful for a
failing memory."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","I no longer treasure life, not even my own."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",I am tired!
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",And the past is a blank.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Did you get everything you, wanted, Captain
Kirk?"
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","My hour is almost come, when I to sulphurous and tormenting
fires must render up myself."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","I am thy
father's spirit, doomed for a certain term to walk the night,"
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","But that I am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house,"
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Thy soul, freeze thy young blood."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","There was a voice out of the past haunting me, torturing me."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",There was another part I once played long ago.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","I never told you about
it."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",Now that same curtain rises again.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",The time has come.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",What are you saying?
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",What have you done?
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",All of them?
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",All seven?
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",More blood on my hands?
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Oh, my child, my child."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",You've left me nothing!
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","You were the
one thing in my life untouched by what I'd done."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",I was a soldier in a cause.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","There were things to be done,
terrible things."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Murder, flight, suicide, madness."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","I never wanted the blood on
my hands ever to stain you."
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","Lenore, don't!"
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",No.
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King","No, child!"
KARIDIAN,"The
Conscience of the King",Don't!
MARTHA,"The
Conscience of the King","I can't tell him anything, Jim."
MARTHA,"The
Conscience of the King","He's been like this since the
company of actors arrived."
MARTHA,"The
Conscience of the King",He went to town.
MARTHA,"The
Conscience of the King",He called.
MARTHA,"The
Conscience of the King",He's on his way back.
MARTHA,"The
Conscience of the King",At least he has peace now.
MARTHA,"The
Conscience of the King",He never really had that before.
MARTHA,"The
Conscience of the King","Oh,
why was Tom killed if what he suspected wasn't true?"
MARTHA,"The

hundred Benecia time."
SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",Any explanation?
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",He's a fine young officer.
SPOCK,"The

consider this transfer a disciplinary action."
SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","According to our library banks, it
started on the Earth colony of Tarsus Four, when the food supply was
attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","There were over
eight thousand colonists and virtually no food."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","And that was when
Governor Kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",You may not have heard it all.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","Kodos began to separate the
colonists."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","Some would live, be rationed whatever food was left."
SPOCK,"The

remainder would be immediately put to death."
SPOCK,"The

theories of eugenics."
SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","Relief arrived, but too late to prevent the executions."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",And Kodos?
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",There never was a positive identification of his body.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",He'd better.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","There were nine eye witnesses who survived the
massacre, who'd actually seen Kodos with their own eyes."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","Jim Kirk was
one of them."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","With the exception of Riley and Captain Kirk, every other eye witness
is dead."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","And my library computer shows that wherever they were, on
Earth, on a colony, or aboard ship, the Karidian Company of Players was
somewhere near when they died."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",You've got to pull him through.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","If he dies, the only one who'll be able to identify Kodos is the
Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",And he'll be the next target.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",Someone tried to poison him.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",I don't believe that and neither do you.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","I want the Captain to
see that report."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",Now.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","Can we predict the same for you, Captain?"
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",Lieutenant Riley was a witness.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",So were you.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",Someone tried to kill him.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","You should be told the difference between empiricism and
stubbornness, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","I checked with the library computer, just as you
did."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",I got the same information.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","Is my personal business when it might interfere with the smooth
operation of this ship."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",It could happen.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","Even in this corner of the galaxy, Captain, two plus two equals
four."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",Almost certainly an attempt will be made to kill you.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","Why do you
invite death?"
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King",He is.
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","Logic, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","Doctor Leighton was murdered while the Karidian
Company was on Planet Q."
SPOCK,"The
Conscience of the King","Now an attempt has been made against Riley
while the company is on board the Enterprise."

MCCOY,"The

about, anyway?"
MCCOY,"The

MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King",Illogical?
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King",Did you get a look at that Juliet?
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King","That's a pretty
exciting creature."
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King","Of course your, personal chemistry would prevent you
from seeing that."
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King","Did it ever occur to you that he simply might like
the girl?"
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King",You would.
MCCOY,"The

Spock."

MCCOY,"The

it, huh?"
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King","I appreciate whatever concern you may have
for the ship's company, Mister Spock,"
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King",I've heard of it.
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King","Unfortunately, he wasn't the first."
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King",What has Karidian to do with it?
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King",You think Jim suspects he's Kodos?
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King",It's unbelievable.
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King",I'm not sure I can.
MCCOY,"The

MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King",Are you?
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King",Are you sure it's not vengeance?
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King",What if you decide he is Kodos?
MCCOY,"The
Conscience of the King",What then?
MCCOY,"The

MCCOY,"The

Lieutenant's family."

standing orders to investigate all quasars and quasar-like phenomena
wherever they may be encountered."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Besides, it's three days to Makus."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",And the rendezvous doesn't take place for five.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",No problem.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Captain to Galileo.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",All systems cleared for take off.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Launch shuttlecraft.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Anything at all?
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Try and get me a fix on the Galileo.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",That thing out there has ionized this complete sector.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","None of
our instruments work."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","At least four complete solar systems in the
immediate vicinity."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","And out there somewhere, a twenty four foot
shuttlecraft, off course, out of control."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Finding a needle in a
haystack would be child's play."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","I'm aware of that, Commissioner."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","At the same time I have certain
scientific duties I must perform, and investigating the Murasaki effect
is one."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",We have two days to find them.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","What would you have me do, turn around and leave them there?"
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Thank you, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Mister Sulu.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Set course for Taurus Two.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","If they're not there, Commissioner, then they're dead by now."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Mister Sulu.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Anything on your scanners?
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Have you tried tying in to the auxiliary power?
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Transport room, this is the captain speaking."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Are the
transporters beaming up yet?"
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Thank you.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",This is the captain speaking.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Flight deck, prepare
Columbus for immediate exit, for a search of the planet surface."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Correlate co-ordinates with Mister Sulu.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Thank you.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Anything, Uhura?"
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","We have until 2823.8 to continue the search, Commissioner."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Look, these people are my friends and my shipmates."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","I intend to
continue the ship's search for them until the last possible moment."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","I'm familiar with the regulations, Commissioner."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","I know all about
your authority."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Launch shuttlecraft Columbus.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Have them proceed to the next quadrant.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Any word from engineering
on our sensors?"
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",What about the transporters?
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Thank you, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, Commissioner?"
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","I haven't forgotten, Commissioner."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","I haven't forgotten that, Commissioner."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",This is the captain.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Try
using overload power on the transporters."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","We've got to get them
working."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Uhura, order the Columbus to open its course two degrees on every
lap from now on."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","It also means we have a fighting chance to cover the majority of
the planet's surface."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Mind your helm, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Good.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",This is the captain.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Landing parties one, two, and three,
report to transporter room for immediate beaming down to surface of the
planet."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Ordinance condition One A.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","I'm depending on luck, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","It's almost the only tool we
have that'll work."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",What word from the sensor section?
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",I'm not interested in the last report.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",I want to know now.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",I'm perfectly aware of how much time I have left.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",You do that.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",What about radio communication?
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Do?
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",I intend to continue the search.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Foot by foot, inch by inch,
by candlelight if necessary, until the last possible moment."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","And if
you'd keep your nose off my bridge, I'd be thankful."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","I'm in command here, Mister Ferris."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",(going to Spock's station) Put Lieutenant Kelowitz on visual.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Report.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",There are casualties?
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Thank you, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",You'd better report to Sickbay yourself.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",But they're still out there.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",The Columbus hasn't returned yet.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","I still have two search parties
out."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Lieutenant.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Order the transporter room to immediately beam up the two search
parties from the surface."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Attempt to contact the Columbus.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Then have them return immediately.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Sulu, prepare to
abandon search."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Set course for Makus Three.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",What about the other systems?
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Stand ready, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","How long before the Columbus comes on
board?"
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Twenty three minutes.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Sulu, proceed on course for Makus Three, at space normal
speed."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Those are my orders.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Lieutenant Uhura, order all sensor sections
to direct beams aft."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Full function, continuous operation until further
orders."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Sensors, a meteorite?"
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","A hundred and eighty degrees about, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Lieutenant
Uhura, contact transporter room."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",All beams ready.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Full normal speed.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Activate beams.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Sulu, proceed on course to Makus Three."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Ahead warp factor
one."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",There's really something I don't understand about all of this.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",Maybe you can explain it to me.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Logically, of course."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","When you jettisoned the fuel and ignited it, you knew there was
virtually no chance of it being seen, yet you did it anyhow."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","That would
seem to me to be an act of desperation."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Now we all know, and I'm sure the doctor will agree with me, that
desperation is a highly emotional state of mind."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","How does your
well-known logic explain that?"
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven",I see.
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","You mean you reasoned that it was time for an emotional
outburst."
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","You're not going to admit that for the first time in your life,
you committed a purely human emotional act?"
KIRK,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Spock, you're a stubborn man."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","I remind you, Captain, I'm entirely opposed to this delay."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","Your
mission is to get those emergency medical supplies to Makus Three in
time for their transfer to the New Paris colonies."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",I don't like to take chances.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","The plague is out of control on
New Paris."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",We must get those drugs there on time.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","What is it, Captain?"
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",I was opposed to this from the very beginning.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","Our flight to
Makus Three is of the very highest priority."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, but you've lost your crew."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",Two days?
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",ln all that?
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",Two days?
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",You shouldn't have sent them out in the first place.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",You said something about a needle in a haystack.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",It's useless.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","Well, Captain?"
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","You don't really think you'll have any luck, do you?"
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","Very well, Captain, but not one second beyond that moment."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","Is
that clear?"
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","If it isn't, I suggest you look at book nineteen, section
four thirty three, paragraph twelve."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",Captain.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","I don't relish the thought of abandoning your crewmen out
there, however I must remind you"
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",You're running out of time.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","(stepping into the turbolift) Twenty four more hours, Captain."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","You have two hours and forty three minutes, Captain."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",I'm delighted.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",However I shall continue to remind you.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",What do you intend to do?
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","I'm sure the authorities will be pleased by your diligence,
Captain."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","I'm not sure they'll appreciate the way you address a High
Commissioner."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","You are, Captain."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",For another two hours and forty two minutes.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","Captain Kirk, check your chronometer."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","You'll see that it is
2823.8."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",Your time is up.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",So are the plague victims on New Paris.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","I'm sorry, Captain."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","I
now assume authority granted me under Title fifteen, Galactic Emergency
Procedures, and I order you to abandon search."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","You're procrastinating, Captain."
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven",You have your orders.
FERRIS,"The
Galileo Seven","Recall
your search parties and proceed to Makus Three immediately."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Power up.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",All instruments activated.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",All readings normal.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","All
go."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Position?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Make up your mind please, Mister Latimer."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Considerably, Mister Boma."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Stop forward momentum, Mister Latimer."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Galileo to Enterprise.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Galileo to Enterprise.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Come in, please."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Galileo to Enterprise.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Galileo to Enterprise.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","We are out of
control, being pulled directly into the heart of Murasaki three one
two."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Being hit by violent radiation on outer hull.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Course three point
two five"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","I'd say your evaluation is reasonable, Mister Boma."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Picturesque descriptions will not mend broken circuits, Mister
Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",I think you'll find your work is cut out for you.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Galileo to
Enterprise."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Galileo to Enterprise.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Come in, please."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","I expect nothing, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","It is merely logical to try all
the alternatives."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Doctor McCoy, a reading on the atmosphere, please."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Just the facts, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Thank you for your opinion.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",It will be duly noted.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","You're
recording this, Yeoman?"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Scott, if you'll make a survey of the damage, please."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Gentlemen, I think we should move outside, make room for Mister
Scott to do his work."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Latimer, Mister Gaetano, you'll arm
yourselves and scout out the area, keeping in visual contact with the
ship."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Under present conditions, extremely poor."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","If the ionisation effect is as widespread as I believe it is,
Doctor, they'll be searching for us without instrumentation, by visual
contact only."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","On those terms, this is a very large planet."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Not as long as we're grounded.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","We may be here for a very long
time, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",My big chance?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","For what, Doctor?"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","I am a logical man, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Perhaps, Doctor, but I know of no better way to begin."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","I realise
command does have its fascinations, even under circumstances such as
these."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","But I neither enjoy the idea of command, nor am I frightened of
it."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",It simply exists.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","And I will do whatever logically needs to be
done."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Excuse me.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",In what way?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",The weight of three grown men.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Doctor McCoy, with very few exceptions we use virtually every
piece of equipment aboard this craft in attaining orbit."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","There's very
little excess weight, except among the passengers."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Unless the situation changes radically, yes."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","As commanding officer, the choice will be mine."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","A very quaint idea, Mister Boma, but I do believe I'm better
qualified to make the selection than any random drawing of lots."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","My choice will be a logical one, arrived at through logical
means."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","But attaining a desired goal always is, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Now gentlemen, I
suggest we move outside to make a further examination of the hull in
the event we've overlooked any minor damage."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Come on, Boma."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",What was it?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",(returns from investigating) Nothing there.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",I don't doubt your word.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","(pulling the bloody spear from Latimer's body and examining it)
Folsom Point."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","There's a remarkable resemblance to the Folsom Point discovered
in 1925, old world calendar, New Mexico, North America."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","A bit more
crude about the shaft, I believe."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Not very efficient.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Am I in error, Mister Boma?"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Then what, Mister Boma?"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","My concern for the dead will not bring him back to life, Mister
Boma."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Bringing him back to the ship should not interfere with our
repair efforts."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","If you need assistance, I"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Perhaps if you were to channel the second
auxiliary tank through the primary intake valve."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Excellent, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Which would still leave us at least one hundred and fifty pounds
overweight."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","It is more rational to sacrifice one life than six, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",You might be wise to start.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",For what?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Boma, we're working against time."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Doctor, perhaps you know the correct words for such an occasion."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",My place is here.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","If you please, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","By dealing with first things first, I hope to increase our
chances of staying alive."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Well, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",What happened?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",That would seem to solve the problem of who to leave behind.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Consider the alternatives, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Scott, there are always alternatives."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Wood rubbing on some kind of leather.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Not a tribal culture.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Their artefacts are too primitive.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","More
likely a loose association of some sort."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","How, Mister Boma?"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","I'm frequently appalled by the low regard you Earthmen have for
life."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Mister Boma?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Doctor McCoy?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","It does, indeed."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","It seems logical to me, also."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","But to take life
indiscriminately,"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","I am not interested in the opinion of the majority, Mister
Gaetano."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Components must be weighed.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Our danger to ourselves as well as
our duties to other life forms, friendly or not."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","There's a third
course."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",I think not.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Doctor McCoy.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",You and Yeoman Mears return to the ship.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Assist Mister Scott in
any way possible."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",We'll be back shortly.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Gentlemen, you'll follow my orders to the letter, firing only
when so instructed, and at my designated targets."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","We'll fire to frighten, Mister Gaetano, not to kill."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","I am in command, Mister Gaetano."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","The orders and the
responsibility will be mine."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Follow me.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",I hear them.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",They're directly ahead of us.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Several, I believe."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Direct your phasers to two o'clock and to ten o'clock.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, I know."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","But fortunately, I'm giving the orders."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Take aim
please, and fire when I give a signal."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Fire.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",(several seconds of sustained phaser beam) Cease fire.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",(It's gone quiet) They should think twice before bothering us again.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",It was not necessary.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Fear will do for us what needs to be done.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Boma, you will return with me to the Galileo."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Gaetano,
you remain on guard here."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Keep in contact with the ship.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, we found them."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",They won't bother us again.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Go, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","That's all very well, but we don't have a substitute supply."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",They would also seem to be our only hope.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","(after brief thought) Yeoman, your phaser."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",They won't attack for at least several hours.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","By then, with
luck, we'll be gone."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","We don't have to maintain it very long, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","In less
than twenty four hours, the Enterprise will be forced to abandon its
search in order to make a rendezvous."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","If we can't maintain orbit after
that time, it won't make any difference."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","If we burn up in a decaying
orbit or die here on the planet's surface, we shall surely die."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Doctor,
your phaser."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Go to work, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Take this back to Mister Scott for conversion, please Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","(handing over his own phaser) And give this to Mister Scott in
the event I don't return."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","I have a certain scientific curiosity about what's become of
Mister Gaetano."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Return to the ship, please."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Most illogical reaction.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",We demonstrated our superior weapons.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",They should have fled.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Of course.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","They're studying us, for the moment."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","My opinion, Mister Boma."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Seal the windows!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Boma, your tone is increasingly hostile."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Curious.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Most illogical.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Strange.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Step by step, I have made the correct and logical
decisions."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",And yet two men have died.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","I do seem to have miscalculated regarding them, and inculcated
resentment on your parts."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","The sum of the parts cannot be greater than
the whole."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","How much longer, Mister Scott?"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Scott, how much power do we have left
in the ship's batteries?"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Will they electrify the exterior of this ship?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Get to the centre of the ship.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Don't touch the plates.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Be sure
you're insulated."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Stand by.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Are you ready, Scott?"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",All right.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Go.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","(Scott uses a spanner or something to short out
the battery connections) Again!"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Again!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",I believe we've used enough.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Mister Scott.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","I suggest you
continue draining the phasers."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",For the moment.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","The moment they discover they're not seriously hurt, they'll be
back."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Meanwhile, please check the aft compartment."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","See if there's
anything you can unload to lighten the ship."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",It will of course have to be left behind.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",I wouldn't recommend it.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",The creatures won't be far away.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",It would expose members of this crew to unnecessary peril.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Gentlemen.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","All right, Mister Boma, you'll have your burial,
provided the creatures will permit it."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",How about weight?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",And how long can we hold it?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",To land here again?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Not a very attractive possibility.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Doctor McCoy.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Mister Boma.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","When can we lift off, Scott?"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Gentlemen, The ship will lift off in exactly ten minutes."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","You
have that long to bury Mister Gaetano."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Now, it appears to be clear
outside, at least for the moment."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",I'll assist you.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Hurry.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Get into the ship!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Immediate lift off!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",No!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Go back!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Lift off!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Go back!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",No!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","All right, All right!"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Go!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Go!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Go!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Go!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Go, Scott!"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",I told you to lift off!
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Get us off, Scott!"
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Quite right, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",There's somebody holding us down.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","All
systems are go, but we're not moving."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Our boosters.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Would you rather stay here?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","May I remind you we have yet to achieve orbit, nor can we
maintain it long."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","An hour from now we may be right back where we
started from."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Gentlemen, by coming after me, you may well have destroyed what
slim chance you had for survival."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","The logical thing for you to have
done was to have left me behind."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",That is a most illogical attitude.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Orbit in one minute, Mister
Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Fuel status?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",It is the usual end of a decaying orbit.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Infinitely preferable to the kind of death we'd be granted on
the planet's surface, I should think."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Did l?
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",I may have been mistaken.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",The Enterprise is surely on course for Makus Three by now.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","I for
one do not believe in angels."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Yes.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",My first command.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Galileo to Enterprise.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Galileo to Enterprise, come in, please."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Galileo to Enterprise.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Come in, please."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Perhaps, Mister Boma."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",No one out there to see it.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Totally illogical.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",There was no chance.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven",Captain.
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Quite correct, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Quite simply, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","I examined the problem from all angles,
and it was plainly hopeless."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Logic informed me that under the
circumstances, the only possible action would have to be one of
desperation."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Logical decision, logically arrived at."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Well, I wouldn't put it in exactly those terms, Captain, but
those are essentially the facts."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","No, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, sir."
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",Readings normal.
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",Acceleration normal.
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven","Phase
one separation normal."
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Spock, radiation is increasing."
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",Yes.
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",I just got a little bump on the head.
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",Thank you.
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven","Of course, Mister Spock."
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",We should be able to scrape up another hundred pounds.
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",If we knew more about them
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",Did you find them?
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",But what if the creatures attack again?
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",Why haven't they done anything?
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",We could use a little inspiration.
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven","Enterprise, this is Galileo."
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven","Come in,
please."
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",Enterprise.
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven","Nothing, sir."
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",Just ionic interference.
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",We're moving!
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",I don't want to die up here.
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",What happened?
MEARS,"The
Galileo Seven",It's getting hot.
LATIMER,"The
Galileo Seven",Three point seven.
LATIMER,"The
Galileo Seven","Sir, I"
LATIMER,"The
Galileo Seven","Sir, this indicator's gone crazy."
LATIMER,"The
Galileo Seven","I can't, sir."
LATIMER,"The
Galileo Seven",Nothing happens.
LATIMER,"The
Galileo Seven","Aye, aye, sir."
LATIMER,"The
Galileo Seven",What is it?
LATIMER,"The
Galileo Seven","No, it's from back there."
LATIMER,"The
Galileo Seven",Let's get out of here.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","That's to be expected, Mister Spock."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","Quasars are extremely
disruptive."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","Just how much, we don't know."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","Ionic interference, Mister Spock."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Now that's what I call a ride.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","I can't be sure, but I'd say that, the magnetic potential of the
effect was (McCoy gives him a tissue for his nose bleed) Thank you."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","Was
such that, as we gathered speed, it was multiplied geometrically."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","And
we were simply shot into the centre of the effect."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Like a projectile.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",You mean three of us must stay behind.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",And who's to choose?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",You wouldn't be interested in drawing lots?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","All right, Mister Spock."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Who?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","If any minor damage was overlooked, it was when they put his head
together."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Did you see what it was?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Poor Latimer.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",We'll get off all right.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Sir?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Not very efficient?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Is that all you have to say?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",You?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Error?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Impossible.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","There's a man lying there dead, and you talk about stone spears."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",What about Latimer?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",(looking in from outside) Mister Spock.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",we're ready.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",The services for Latimer.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",The man's dead.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",He deserves a decent burial.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",You're the captain.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",A few words.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Not necessarily.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","It could be a simple tribal rite, assuming a
tribal culture."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",We know enough.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","If they're tribal, they'll have a sense of unity."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",We can use that.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",By hitting them hard.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Give them a bloody nose.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","Make them think
twice about attacking us."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Absolutely.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",The mists.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",I can't see them.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","Nobody knows what's happened to Gaetano, and you hand over his
phaser like
nothing's happened at all."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Do you really think the ship will ever leave?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","Another prediction, Mister Spock?"
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","All right, Spock, you have all the answers."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",What now?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","My tone isn't the only thing that's hostile, Mister Spock!"
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",I'm sick and tired of your logic!
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",How long do you think those plates will hold out under this?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",We've got to do something!
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",For the moment?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Mister Gaetano's body's back there.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Not without a burial.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","Not without a burial, Mister Spock."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",I'll take that chance.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven","You see, Mister Spock, I would insist upon
a decent burial even if your body was back there."
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",I'm sick and tired of this machine!
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",They let go!
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",You mean a burn-up?
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",I admire your ability to make so measured a choice.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",We need that fuel to maintain orbit.
BOMA,"The
Galileo Seven",Are you out of your mind?
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",We're being drawn right into it.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",You all right?
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Scotty?
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Boma?
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Yeoman?
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",(helping her back into her seat) Upsy-daisy.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",What happened?
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Partial pressure of oxygen, seventy millimetres of mercury."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Nitrogen one forty.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Breathable, if you're not running in competition."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Traces of argon, neon, krypton, all in acceptable quantities."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","However, I wouldn't recommend this place as a summer resort."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",What do you think our chances are of contacting the Enterprise?
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",But they'll be looking for us.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Then you don't think they'll find us.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Well, I can't say much for the circumstances, but at least it's
your big chance."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Command.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Oh, I know you, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","You've never voiced it,
but you've always thought that logic was the best basis on which to
build command."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Am I right?
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",It'll take more than logic to get us out of this.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Or the equivalent weight in equipment.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Spock, life and death are seldom logical."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Not his head, Mister Boma, his heart."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",His heart.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","(coming in from rear compartment) This should save us at least
fifty pounds, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",I can't believe you're serious about leaving someone behind.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Now
whatever it is that's out there"
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",I'm not talking about rationality.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Spock, that's your place."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Now look.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",We may all die here.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","At least let us die like men, not
machines."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Mister Spock!
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Something's happening outside.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","What do those supersensitive ears make of that, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Seems logical to me.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Yes.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Right.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",I hope not.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Scotty has an idea.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Trouble is, they happen to be our only defence."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Just where are you going?
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",I don't know.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","He'll risk his neck locating Gaetano and if he
finds him, he's just as liable to order him to stay behind."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","You tell
me."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Well, it won't unless we get these phasers back."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Well, Mister Spock, they didn't stay frightened very long, did
they?"
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",You mean they should have respected us?
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Spock, respect is a rational process."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Did it ever occur
to you they might react emotionally, with anger?"
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",They were perfectly predictable to anyone with feeling.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","You
might as well admit it, Mister Spock, your precious logic brought them
down on us."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Studying us, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",They seem to learn rather quickly.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",And you've brought our furry friends down on us.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",That won't be long enough.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",It must've worked.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",Mister Boma.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Don't be a fool, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",We couldn't leave you out there.
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",We got off!
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Spock, remind me to tell you that I'm sick and tired of
your logic."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",After that?
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Well, at least I lived long enough to hear that."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Is there
anything we can do?"
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","Well, Mister Spock, so ends your first command."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","How long have we got now, Scotty?"
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven","It may be the last action you'll ever take, Mister Spock, but it
was all human."
MCCOY,"The
Galileo Seven",That's exactly what I mean.
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Nothing clear, Captain."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Just a few words about being pulled off
course."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Captain, there's one planet in this solar system capable of
sustaining human life."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","It's type M, oxygen, nitrogen, and it's listed
as Taurus Two."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven",It's unexplored.
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","As far as we can determine with our
equipment malfunction, it's just about dead-centre of the Murasaki
effect."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Nothing, Captain."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","All wavelengths dominated by ionisation effects, sir."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Transmission is blocked, reception impossible."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Captain, the Columbus has returned from
searching quadrant seven seven nine X by five three four M. Results
negative."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","They're working on them, sir."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven",Still inoperable.
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven",They're still reported unsafe.
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven",At last report they were getting some readings
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Sir, sensor section reporting."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Static interference still
creating false images."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven",Estimates eighty percent undependable.
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven",Clearing slowly.
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven",Still incapable of transmission or reception.
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Captain Kirk, landing party number two has
been beamed back aboard ship."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven",They have casualties.
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","One dead, two
injured."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","I'm in partial contact with them now, sir."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Captain, the sensor section says the beams
are working again."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","No, sir."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven",Too much interference.
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Twenty three minutes, sir."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","The Columbus is aboard, sir."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","The flight
hatch is closed."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Transporter room reports
last of the landing parties have beamed safely up."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","All systems report
secured for warp factors."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Transporters locked in, sir."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Captain, transporter room just beamed up five persons."
UHURA,"The
Galileo Seven","Alive and
well."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","Scanners are blank, Captain."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","We're getting a mass of readings
I've never seen."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven",Nothing makes sense.
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, sir."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, Captain?"
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","Totally inoperative, sir."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven",No readings at all.
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, sir."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven",No change.
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","But Captain, two degrees means they'll be overlooking more than a
dozen terrestrial miles on each search loop."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, sir."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","Captain, course set for Makus Three."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","Space normal, sir?"
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","Captain, there's something there on screen, at Taurus Two."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven",No.
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven",It's holding a lateral line.
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven",There it is again.
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","Holding
steady, Captain."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","Whatever it was, Captain, it just burned up in the atmosphere."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven","Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,"The
Galileo Seven",Warp factor one.
COMPUTER,"The
Galileo Seven","Negative ionic concentration one point six four times ten to
the ninth power metres, Radiation wave length three hundred seventy
angstroms."
COMPUTER,"The
Galileo Seven",Harmonics upward along entire spectrum.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",(Holding his right wrist) Yes.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",II don't know.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",It's from up there.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",It's everywhere.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",It's all around us!
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven","It was something huge, terrible."
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",Up there.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",I think I hit it.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",Vaguely.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",It was like a giant ape.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",At least it was quick for him.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",I tell you there was.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",But there must be something.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",I swear I hit it.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",Mister Spock.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven","In the interest of efficiency, I don't think we
should leave his body here."
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",We'll do it.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven","Give me a hand with Latimer, will you?"
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",They're getting ready.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",They'll attack.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, I agree."
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven","If we stand by and do nothing, we're just giving
them an invitation to come down and slaughter us."
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven","Well, we're practical about it."
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven","I say we hit them before they
hit us."
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",The majority.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",That could get us killed.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",Now you're talking.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven","Oh, for the."
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",You saw what they did to Latimer!
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",I say we hit them dead on.
GAETANO,"The
Galileo Seven",I still say we should have killed them.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",What a mess.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","You don't really expect to get an answer, do you?"
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",Logical.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Very bad, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",We've lost a great deal of fuel.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","We have no chance at all to
reach escape velocity."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","And if we ever hope to make orbit, we'll have to
lighten our load by at least five hundred pounds."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Aye, you could put it that way."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",It's too delicate.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","It may not be able to take the pressure as it
is."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",If you'll give me a hand with this conduit.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",Pressure's dropping.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",We're losing everything.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",One of the lines gave.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","The strain of coming through the
atmosphere and the added load when we tried to bypass."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Yes, that's done
it."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",We have no fuel.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",We have no fuel!
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",What alternatives?
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","It's dangerous, but it might work."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","I can adjust the main reactor to function with a substitute fuel
supply."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Aye, we do."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",Our phasers.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",I can adapt them and use their energy.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","It'll take time, but it's possible."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",Aye.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","If I can get a full load, we should be able to achieve orbit
with all hands."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",Not that we can maintain it long.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Aye, aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Another hour, maybe two."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Doctor, a phaser can only drain so fast."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",You've got your hands full.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","They're in good shape, but they won't lift us off, if that's
what you're getting at."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","That they will, Mister Spock!"
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Ready, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",I daren't use any more.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",Not and be sure of ignition.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",Aye.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",That's enough!
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",That's it.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","If we shed every ounce, we might be able to achieve orbit."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","A few hours, no longer."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","But if we time it right, we can cut out
of orbit and save enough fuel for a controlled re=entry."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","We have very few alternatives, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",Maybe eight minutes if the weight's right.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Aye, aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","We should be moving, but we're not."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",What are you doing?
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",We'll never be able to hold orbit.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","No, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",Fifteen pounds psi.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Approximately enough for one orbit, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",Tapping our boosters ended our last chance for a soft landing.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Spock, you said a while ago that there were always
alternatives."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Orbit attitude, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","With our present fuel, that gives
us about forty five minutes."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",Mister Spock!
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",He jettisoned the fuel and ignited it.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",The orbit'll start decaying as soon as the fuel's exhausted.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Say
six minutes."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",A distress signal?
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","It's like sending up a
flare."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Mister Spock, that was a good gamble."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",Perhaps it was worth it.
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven","Orbit decaying, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,"The
Galileo Seven",Ten seconds to atmosphere.
CHIEF,"The
Galileo Seven","Not one hundred percent, Captain."
CHIEF,"The
Galileo Seven","We beamed down some inert
material, but it came back in a disassociated condition."
CHIEF,"The
Galileo Seven","We wouldn't
dare try with people."
CHIEF,"The
Galileo Seven","Aye, aye, Captain."
CHIEF,"The
Galileo Seven","They came back all right, sir."
CHIEF,"The
Galileo Seven","In my opinion, the transporters
are now safe for human transport."
CHIEF,"The
Galileo Seven","Captain, it's a big planet."
CHIEF,"The
Galileo Seven","It'll be sheer luck if our landing
parties find anything."
KELOWITZ,"The
Galileo Seven","Kelowitz, Captain."
KELOWITZ,"The
Galileo Seven","We were attacked, Captain."
KELOWITZ,"The
Galileo Seven","Huge, furry
creatures."
KELOWITZ,"The
Galileo Seven","I checked with astral anthropology, and they're order 480G,
anthropoid."
KELOWITZ,"The
Galileo Seven","Similar to life forms discovered on Hansen's Planet, but
much larger."
KELOWITZ,"The
Galileo Seven","Ten, twelve feet in height."
KELOWITZ,"The
Galileo Seven","Ensign O'Neal got a spear through the body
before we even knew they were around."
KELOWITZ,"The
Galileo Seven","Lieutenant lmmamura has a
dislocated shoulder and severe lacerations, but he'll make it all
right."
KELOWITZ,"The
Galileo Seven","Captain, the creatures are all over the place."
KELOWITZ,"The
Galileo Seven","If the Galileo is
down on that planet, I"
KELOWITZ,"The
Galileo Seven","Aye, aye, Captain."
STONE,Court Martial,Maintenance Section Eighteen.
STONE,Court Martial,The section is working on the Intrepid.
STONE,Court Martial,Reschedule.
STONE,Court Martial,The Enterprise is on priority one.
STONE,Court Martial,"That makes three times you've read it, Jim."
STONE,Court Martial,Is there an error?
STONE,Court Martial,"Regulations, Captain."
STONE,Court Martial,And the extract from your ship's computer log confirming this sworn deposition?
STONE,Court Martial,It's a great pity.
STONE,Court Martial,The service can't afford to lose men like Lieutenant Commander Finney.
STONE,Court Martial,I'll take that.
STONE,Court Martial,"Mister Spock, would you please?"
STONE,Court Martial,"Captain Kirk, you say you jettisoned the pod after the Red Alert?"
STONE,Court Martial,"Then, Captain, I must presume you've committed willful perjury."
STONE,Court Martial,This extract from your computer log says you jettisoned the pod before going to Red Alert.
STONE,Court Martial,Consider yourself confined to the base.
STONE,Court Martial,Official inquiry will determine whether a general court martial is in order.
STONE,Court Martial,"This inquiry, to determine whether a general court-martial should be convened against Captain Kirk on charges of perjury and culpable negligence."
STONE,Court Martial,Let us begin with your relationship with Commander Finney.
STONE,Court Martial,"You knew him for a long time, didn't you?"
STONE,Court Martial,It's common knowledge that something happened to your friendship.
STONE,Court Martial,Continue.
STONE,Court Martial,And he blamed you for that?
STONE,Court Martial,Comment.
STONE,Court Martial,Service record of Lieutenant Commander Finney to be appended this inquiry.
STONE,Court Martial,"Now let's get into the specifics of the storm, Captain."
STONE,Court Martial,Why Finney?
STONE,Court Martial,If he blamed you
STONE,Court Martial,"Then why, Captain, does the computer log from your ship, made automatically at the time, indicate that you were still on Yellow Alert when you jettisoned and not on Red?"
STONE,Court Martial,It would seem so.
STONE,Court Martial,Could the computer be wrong?
STONE,Court Martial,Stop recording.
STONE,Court Martial,"Now, look, Jim."
STONE,Court Martial,Not one man in a million could do what you and I have done.
STONE,Court Martial,Command a starship.
STONE,Court Martial,"A hundred decisions a day, hundreds of lives staked on you making every one of them right."
STONE,Court Martial,"You're played out, Jim."
STONE,Court Martial,Exhausted.
STONE,Court Martial,That's the way my report'll read if you co-operate.
STONE,Court Martial,Possibly.
STONE,Court Martial,Admit nothing.
STONE,Court Martial,Say nothing.
STONE,Court Martial,Let me bury the matter here and now.
STONE,Court Martial,"No starship captain has ever stood trial before, and I don't want you to be the first."
STONE,Court Martial,"KIRK: But if what you suspect is true, then I'm guilty."
STONE,Court Martial,I should be punished.
STONE,Court Martial,I'm thinking of the service.
STONE,Court Martial,I won't have it smeared.
STONE,Court Martial,All right.
STONE,Court Martial,"By an evident perjurer who's either covering his bad judgment, his cowardice, or"
STONE,Court Martial,"It's in the transcript, and computer transcripts don't lie."
STONE,Court Martial,"I'm telling you, Captain, either you accept a permanent ground assignment, or the whole disciplinary weight of Starfleet command is going to light right on your neck."
STONE,Court Martial,Then you draw a general court.
STONE,Court Martial,This court is now in session.
STONE,Court Martial,"I have appointed as members of this court Space Command Representative Lindstrom, Starship Captains Krasnovsky and Chandra."
STONE,Court Martial,"Captain Kirk, I direct your attention to the fact that you have a right to ask for substitute officers if you feel that any of these named harbour any prejudiced attitudes to your case."
STONE,Court Martial,Do you consent to the service Lieutenant Shaw as prosecuting officer and to myself as president of the court?
STONE,Court Martial,"All right, clerk."
STONE,Court Martial,"Proceed, Lieutenant."
STONE,Court Martial,You may step down.
STONE,Court Martial,You may step down.
STONE,Court Martial,You may step down.
STONE,Court Martial,Mister Cogley.
STONE,Court Martial,"You've listened to testimony from three witnesses, and in neither instance have you availed yourself of your right to cross-examine."
STONE,Court Martial,Have you abrogated that right?
STONE,Court Martial,Court recognises counsel for the prosecution.
STONE,Court Martial,Mister Cogley?
STONE,Court Martial,Continue.
STONE,Court Martial,Court is now in session.
STONE,Court Martial,The board will entertain motions before delivering its verdict.
STONE,Court Martial,Counsel for the prosecution?
STONE,Court Martial,Counsel for the defence?
STONE,Court Martial,Mister Cogley.
STONE,Court Martial,Mister Cogley!
STONE,Court Martial,Of what nature is this evidence?
STONE,Court Martial,Counsels will kindly direct their remarks to the bench.
STONE,Court Martial,Sustained.
STONE,Court Martial,"Mister Cogley, we are waiting for proof of the extraordinary statement you made in the briefing room."
STONE,Court Martial,"This court is by no means adjourned, Mister Cogley."
STONE,Court Martial,Very well.
STONE,Court Martial,"Captain, are you maintaining an engine crew aboard?"
STONE,Court Martial,Finney.
STONE,Court Martial,So Finney is alive.
STONE,Court Martial,The orbit is beginning to decay.
STONE,Court Martial,"Mister Spock, the court has not yet reached a verdict."
STONE,Court Martial,We will hear this witness out.
STONE,Court Martial,"Unless the prosecution has an objection, I rule this court to be dismissed."
KIRK,Court Martial,No.
KIRK,Court Martial,But the death of the crewman.
KIRK,Court Martial,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Court Martial,Where's Mister Spock with that computer log extract?
KIRK,Court Martial,Kirk out.
KIRK,Court Martial,I agree.
KIRK,Court Martial,I waited until the last possible moment.
KIRK,Court Martial,We were on Red Alert.
KIRK,Court Martial,The storm got worse.
KIRK,Court Martial,I had to jettison the pod.
KIRK,Court Martial,"What took you so long, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Court Martial,Jamie.
KIRK,Court Martial,That's not so.
KIRK,Court Martial,He was my friend.
KIRK,Court Martial,You have my sworn deposition.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Timothy, I haven't seen you since the Vulcanian expedition."
KIRK,Court Martial,"(no reply) Well, I see our graduating class from the Academy is well represented."
KIRK,Court Martial,Corrigan.
KIRK,Court Martial,Teller.
KIRK,Court Martial,"How you doing, Mike?"
KIRK,Court Martial,Couple of days.
KIRK,Court Martial,In a hurry to see me go?
KIRK,Court Martial,You can talk plainer than that.
KIRK,Court Martial,Go on.
KIRK,Court Martial,Finish.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Ben was a friend of yours, and"
KIRK,Court Martial,Go on.
KIRK,Court Martial,I'm waiting to hear the rest.
KIRK,Court Martial,What would be the point?
KIRK,Court Martial,You've already made up your minds.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Excuse me, Bones."
KIRK,Court Martial,Ready.
KIRK,Court Martial,Yes.
KIRK,Court Martial,"He was an instructor at the Academy when I was a midshipman, but that didn't stand in the way of our beginning a close friendship."
KIRK,Court Martial,"His daughter Jamie, who was here last night, was named after me."
KIRK,Court Martial,It's no secret.
KIRK,Court Martial,We were assigned to the same ship some years later.
KIRK,Court Martial,I relieved him on watch once and found a circuit open to the atomic matter piles that should've been closed.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Another five minutes, it could have blown up the ship."
KIRK,Court Martial,"United Starship Republic, number 1371."
KIRK,Court Martial,I closed the switch and logged the incident.
KIRK,Court Martial,He drew a reprimand and was sent to the bottom of the promotion list.
KIRK,Court Martial,Yes.
KIRK,Court Martial,He had been at the Academy for an unusually long time as an instructor.
KIRK,Court Martial,"As a result, he was late in being assigned to a starship."
KIRK,Court Martial,"The delay, he felt, looked bad on his record."
KIRK,Court Martial,"My action, he believed, made things worse."
KIRK,Court Martial,Weather scan indicated an ion storm dead ahead.
KIRK,Court Martial,I sent Finney into the pod.
KIRK,Court Martial,His name was at the top of the duty roster.
KIRK,Court Martial,"He may have blamed me that he never rose to command a ship, but I don't assign jobs on the basis of who blames me."
KIRK,Court Martial,"It was Finney's turn, and I assigned him."
KIRK,Court Martial,He had just checked in with me from the pod when we hit the leading edge of the storm.
KIRK,Court Martial,Not too bad at first.
KIRK,Court Martial,I signalled a Yellow Alert.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Then we began encountering pressure, variant stress, force seven, the works."
KIRK,Court Martial,I finally signaled a Red Alert.
KIRK,Court Martial,Finney knew he had a matter of seconds.
KIRK,Court Martial,I gave him those seconds and more.
KIRK,Court Martial,But apparently it wasn't enough.
KIRK,Court Martial,I don't know.
KIRK,Court Martial,There's been a mistake.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Mister Spock is running a survey right now, but the odds are next to impossible."
KIRK,Court Martial,Is that the way you see it?
KIRK,Court Martial,A physical breakdown.
KIRK,Court Martial,Possibly even mental collapse.
KIRK,Court Martial,I'd be admitting a man died because
KIRK,Court Martial,"By what, Commodore Stone?"
KIRK,Court Martial,"That's as far as you go, sir."
KIRK,Court Martial,I'm telling you I was there on the Bridge.
KIRK,Court Martial,I know what happened.
KIRK,Court Martial,I know what I did.
KIRK,Court Martial,So that's the way we do it now?
KIRK,Court Martial,"Sweep it under the rug, and me along with it?"
KIRK,Court Martial,Not on your life.
KIRK,Court Martial,I intend to fight.
KIRK,Court Martial,Draw it?
KIRK,Court Martial,I demand it.
KIRK,Court Martial,"And right now, Commodore Stone."
KIRK,Court Martial,Right now.
KIRK,Court Martial,Areel.
KIRK,Court Martial,Doctor McCoy said you were here.
KIRK,Court Martial,"I should have felt it in the air, like static electricity."
KIRK,Court Martial,You look marvellous.
KIRK,Court Martial,You haven't changed a bit.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Oh, you've heard about that, have you?"
KIRK,Court Martial,I remember.
KIRK,Court Martial,Let's forget it.
KIRK,Court Martial,We have a lot of lost time to make up for.
KIRK,Court Martial,The confidence of an innocent man.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Look, Let's not talk shop."
KIRK,Court Martial,I never could talk you into anything.
KIRK,Court Martial,All right.
KIRK,Court Martial,Fire away.
KIRK,Court Martial,What other choice is there?
KIRK,Court Martial,"You, perhaps?"
KIRK,Court Martial,"Well, a girl with your ability should be able to handle two cases at once."
KIRK,Court Martial,You still haven't made any recommendation.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Areel, you still haven't told me how you know so much about what the prosecution's going to do."
KIRK,Court Martial,Yes.
KIRK,Court Martial,(Notices the piles of books everywhere) What is all this?
KIRK,Court Martial,I hope I'm not crowding you.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Oh, I like them fine, but a computer takes less space."
KIRK,Court Martial,Why not?
KIRK,Court Martial,And what would be the point?
KIRK,Court Martial,"You have to be either an obsessive crackpot who's escaped from his keeper or Samuel T. Cogley, attorney at law."
KIRK,Court Martial,I'm afraid so.
KIRK,Court Martial,"I have no objections, sir."
KIRK,Court Martial,"I do, sir."
KIRK,Court Martial,Not guilty.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Yes, sir, there was."
KIRK,Court Martial,"Firstly, I am at a loss to explain the errors in the extract from the computer log."
KIRK,Court Martial,We were in an ion storm.
KIRK,Court Martial,Everyone here in this court knows the dangers involved.
KIRK,Court Martial,I was in command.
KIRK,Court Martial,"The decisions were mine, no one else's."
KIRK,Court Martial,Charges of malice have been raised.
KIRK,Court Martial,There was no malice.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Lieutenant Commander Finney was a member of my crew, and that's exactly the way he was treated."
KIRK,Court Martial,It has been suggested that I panicked on the bridge and jettisoned the ion pod prematurely.
KIRK,Court Martial,That is not so.
KIRK,Court Martial,You've heard some of the details of my record.
KIRK,Court Martial,This was not my first crisis.
KIRK,Court Martial,It was one of many.
KIRK,Court Martial,"During it, I did what my experience and training required me to do."
KIRK,Court Martial,I took the proper steps in the proper order.
KIRK,Court Martial,"I did exactly what had to be done, exactly when it should have been done."
KIRK,Court Martial,"Given the same circumstances I would do the same thing without hesitation, because the steps I took in the order I took them were absolutely necessary if I were to save my ship."
KIRK,Court Martial,And nothing is more important than my ship.
KIRK,Court Martial,We'll need somebody in the pod for readings.
KIRK,Court Martial,Post him.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Stand by on alert status, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Court Martial,"Warp factor one, Mister Hanson."
KIRK,Court Martial,Tie in.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Make it fast, Ben."
KIRK,Court Martial,I may have to go to Red Alert.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Hold our course, Mister Hanson."
KIRK,Court Martial,"Engineering, then ion pod."
KIRK,Court Martial,One third more thrust.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Stand by to get out of there, Ben."
KIRK,Court Martial,"Steady as she goes, Mister Hanson."
KIRK,Court Martial,But that's not the way it happened.
KIRK,Court Martial,Are you suggesting that I did?
KIRK,Court Martial,"Two days ago, I would've staked anything on my judgment."
KIRK,Court Martial,I spent my whole life training for decisions just like that one.
KIRK,Court Martial,My whole life.
KIRK,Court Martial,Is it possible that when the moment came?
KIRK,Court Martial,No.
KIRK,Court Martial,I know what I did.
KIRK,Court Martial,You can pull out if you want to.
KIRK,Court Martial,Kirk here.
KIRK,Court Martial,I'll tell you what you found.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Nothing, right?"
KIRK,Court Martial,Not bitter enough to forget to thank you for your efforts.
KIRK,Court Martial,No.
KIRK,Court Martial,"It's not all bad, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Court Martial,Who knows.
KIRK,Court Martial,You may be able to beat your next captain at chess.
KIRK,Court Martial,Kirk out.
KIRK,Court Martial,Jamie.
KIRK,Court Martial,This is Lieutenant Commander Finney's daughter.
KIRK,Court Martial,"It's too late for that, Jamie, but I'm glad you don't blame me anymore for what happened."
KIRK,Court Martial,Don't say any more.
KIRK,Court Martial,"I know, and I thank you."
KIRK,Court Martial,I have to go and change.
KIRK,Court Martial,You ready?
KIRK,Court Martial,I instituted a phase one search.
KIRK,Court Martial,"It's a painstaking, thorough attempt in and around the ship to find a man who's presumably injured and unable to respond."
KIRK,Court Martial,I beg your pardon?
KIRK,Court Martial,Yes.
KIRK,Court Martial,Possibly.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Gentlemen, for the purposes of this experiment, it'll be necessary for all personnel, except for members of the court and the command crew, to leave the ship."
KIRK,Court Martial,I am ordering all others to report to the transporter room.
KIRK,Court Martial,Our impulse engines have been shut down.
KIRK,Court Martial,We'll maintain orbit by momentum.
KIRK,Court Martial,We hope to be finished long before that.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Ready, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Court Martial,"Gentlemen, this computer has an auditory sensor."
KIRK,Court Martial,"It can, in effect, hear sounds."
KIRK,Court Martial,"By installing a booster, we can increase that capability on the order of one to the fourth power."
KIRK,Court Martial,The computer should bring us every sound occurring on the ship.
KIRK,Court Martial,Doctor McCoy?
KIRK,Court Martial,"All right, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Court Martial,Turn it down a little.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Gentlemen, that sound is caused by the heartbeats of all the people on board the ship."
KIRK,Court Martial,Doctor McCoy will use this white sound device to mask out each person's heartbeat so that it will be eliminated from the sounds we are hearing.
KIRK,Court Martial,"That's all of us, except for crewman in the transporter room."
KIRK,Court Martial,"Mister Spock, eliminate his heartbeat."
KIRK,Court Martial,That accounts for everyone.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Seal off B deck, sections 18Y through 23D."
KIRK,Court Martial,It would seem so.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Commodore, this is my problem."
KIRK,Court Martial,I'd appreciate it if no one left the bridge.
KIRK,Court Martial,Sam Cogley had gone a shore to bring Jamie Finney on board.
KIRK,Court Martial,We felt Jamie's presence would make Finney easier to handle in the event Finney really were alive.
KIRK,Court Martial,Ben.
KIRK,Court Martial,Ben Finney.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Ben, where are you?"
KIRK,Court Martial,I'm glad you're alive.
KIRK,Court Martial,Ben!
KIRK,Court Martial,"Ben, it's not too late."
KIRK,Court Martial,We can help you.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Put the phaser down, Ben."
KIRK,Court Martial,What about my ship?
KIRK,Court Martial,"Mister Spock, what's our orbit status?"
KIRK,Court Martial,Ben.
KIRK,Court Martial,Why kill innocent people?
KIRK,Court Martial,"I logged the mistake, Ben."
KIRK,Court Martial,"Blame me, not them."
KIRK,Court Martial,It's not too late.
KIRK,Court Martial,You can be helped.
KIRK,Court Martial,But if you kill those people
KIRK,Court Martial,Is Jamie included in that deal?
KIRK,Court Martial,She's on board by now.
KIRK,Court Martial,Yes.
KIRK,Court Martial,She's on board.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Beaten and sobbing, Finney told me where he had sabotaged the prime energy circuits."
KIRK,Court Martial,"The damage he'd caused was considerable, but not irreparable."
KIRK,Court Martial,"With luck, I would be able to effect repairs before our orbit decayed completely."
KIRK,Court Martial,"At the risk of sounding like a mystic, that depends on the stars."
KIRK,Court Martial,I didn't have much of a chance to thank him.
KIRK,Court Martial,I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
KIRK,Court Martial,Let's try.
KIRK,Court Martial,(a gentle but lingering kiss) See?
KIRK,Court Martial,No change.
KIRK,Court Martial,Discipline goes on.
KIRK,Court Martial,"Goodbye, Areel."
KIRK,Court Martial,Better luck next time.
KIRK,Court Martial,She's a very good lawyer.
UHURA,Court Martial,Bridge here.
UHURA,Court Martial,"Go ahead, Captain."
UHURA,Court Martial,"He should have been there ten minutes ago, sir."
UHURA,Court Martial,"Meteorology reports ion storm upcoming, Captain."
UHURA,Court Martial,"Call from the pod, sir."
UHURA,Court Martial,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,Court Martial,Variants fading.
UHURA,Court Martial,"All secure, sir."
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Captain, I believe I"
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Miss Finney, come with me, please."
SPOCK,Court Martial,I know all about them.
SPOCK,Court Martial,Affirmative.
SPOCK,Court Martial,Negative.
SPOCK,Court Martial,Affirmative.
SPOCK,Court Martial,"But the computer is inaccurate, never the less."
SPOCK,Court Martial,It reports that the jettison button was pressed before the Red Alert.
SPOCK,Court Martial,And that is impossible.
SPOCK,Court Martial,"No, I was occupied."
SPOCK,Court Martial,The ship was already on Yellow Alert.
SPOCK,Court Martial,I do not dispute it.
SPOCK,Court Martial,I merely state that it is wrong.
SPOCK,Court Martial,I know the Captain.
SPOCK,Court Martial,He is in
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Lieutenant, I am half Vulcanian."
SPOCK,Court Martial,Vulcanians do not speculate.
SPOCK,Court Martial,I speak from pure logic.
SPOCK,Court Martial,"If I let go of a hammer on a planet that has a positive gravity, I need not see it fall to know that it has in fact fallen."
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Gentlemen, human beings have characteristics just as inanimate objects do."
SPOCK,Court Martial,It is impossible for Captain Kirk to act out of panic or malice.
SPOCK,Court Martial,It is not his nature.
SPOCK,Court Martial,Yes.
SPOCK,Court Martial,In my opinion.
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Mister Finney is top of duty roster, Captain."
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Attention, Commander Finney, report to pod for reading on ion plates."
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Officer posted, Captain."
SPOCK,Court Martial,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,Court Martial,Captain.
SPOCK,Court Martial,I've run a complete megalyte survey on the computer.
SPOCK,Court Martial,"You sound bitter, Captain."
SPOCK,Court Martial,Further instructions?
SPOCK,Court Martial,Chess.
SPOCK,Court Martial,Explain.
SPOCK,Court Martial,That is true.
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Why, thank you, Doctor."
SPOCK,Court Martial,I've just won my fourth game.
SPOCK,Court Martial,Observe for yourself.
SPOCK,Court Martial,Rook to king's pawn four.
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Now, this is the computer's move."
SPOCK,Court Martial,And now mine.
SPOCK,Court Martial,(takes the bishop) Checkmate.
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Mechanically, the computer's flawless."
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Therefore, logically, its report of the captain's guilt is infallible."
SPOCK,Court Martial,"I could not accept that, however."
SPOCK,Court Martial,Exactly.
SPOCK,Court Martial,I programmed it myself for chess some months ago.
SPOCK,Court Martial,The best I should have been able to attain was a draw.
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Transporter room, stand by."
SPOCK,Court Martial,We're beaming down.
SPOCK,Court Martial,Five in all.
SPOCK,Court Martial,Affirmative.
SPOCK,Court Martial,I personally programmed the computer for chess months ago.
SPOCK,Court Martial,I gave the machine an understanding of the game equal to my own.
SPOCK,Court Martial,"The computer cannot make an error and assuming that I do not either, the best that could normally be hoped for would be stalemate after stalemate, and yet I beat the machine five times."
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Someone, either accidentally or deliberately, adjusted the programming and therefore the memory banks of that computer."
SPOCK,Court Martial,Affirmative.
SPOCK,Court Martial,"The Captain, myself, and the records officer."
SPOCK,Court Martial,Affirmative.
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Until he was lost, our records officer was Lieutenant Commander Finney."
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Affirmative, Captain."
SPOCK,Court Martial,"B deck, in or near Engineering."
SPOCK,Court Martial,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,Court Martial,Compensate.
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Decaying, Captain."
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Gentlemen, if you'll please hurry to the transporter room"
SPOCK,Court Martial,"Very well, sir."
SPOCK,Court Martial,Activate port impulse engines.
SPOCK,Court Martial,One third power.
SPOCK,Court Martial,Obviously.
JAMIE,Court Martial,There you are.
JAMIE,Court Martial,I just wanted one more look at you.
JAMIE,Court Martial,The man who killed my father.
JAMIE,Court Martial,Your friend?
JAMIE,Court Martial,You hated him all your life!
JAMIE,Court Martial,"That's why you killed him, you murderer!"
JAMIE,Court Martial,You murderer!
JAMIE,Court Martial,You murderer!
JAMIE,Court Martial,"Mister Cogley, we've got to stop this."
JAMIE,Court Martial,Make him take a ground assignment.
JAMIE,Court Martial,I realise it wasn't his fault.
JAMIE,Court Martial,I won't make any trouble.
JAMIE,Court Martial,Make him change his plea.
JAMIE,Court Martial,I was just so upset that night.
JAMIE,Court Martial,I'm sorry.
JAMIE,Court Martial,But I have to.
JAMIE,Court Martial,"I never realised how close you and Dad had been until I read through some papers he wrote, letters to Mother and me."
JAMIE,Court Martial,I don't know how I ever could've thought that you.
JAMIE,Court Martial,"Mister Cogley, ruining Jim won't change what's happened."
JAMIE,Court Martial,I was just thinking of Jim.
MIKE,Court Martial,"(An older man in a gold shirt) I'll get by, Jim."
MIKE,Court Martial,Why don't you tell us?
TIMOTHY,Court Martial,"(Dark hair, red shirt) I understand you're laying over for repairs."
TIMOTHY,Court Martial,Big job?
TIMOTHY,Court Martial,You moving out then?
TIMOTHY,Court Martial,"Oh, I just wondered how long it'd take to get a new records officer."
TIMOTHY,Court Martial,"I can, but I think the point's been made."
TIMOTHY,Court Martial,Ben was a friend of ours.
MCCOY,Court Martial,"Come on, Jim."
MCCOY,Court Martial,Let's go.
MCCOY,Court Martial,Jim.
MCCOY,Court Martial,"If you have any doubt, that was indeed Captain James Kirk of the Enterprise."
MCCOY,Court Martial,"In these trying times, one of the few."
MCCOY,Court Martial,Doctor Leonard McCoy.
MCCOY,Court Martial,And you?
MCCOY,Court Martial,All of my old friends look like doctors.
MCCOY,Court Martial,All of his look like you.
MCCOY,Court Martial,"Well, you might as well join me for a drink."
MCCOY,Court Martial,"With this inquiry coming up, he's going to need all the friends he can get."
MCCOY,Court Martial,I know something about it.
MCCOY,Court Martial,It's possible.
MCCOY,Court Martial,He could have.
MCCOY,Court Martial,No.
MCCOY,Court Martial,Wait a minute.
MCCOY,Court Martial,I don't quite follow you.
MCCOY,Court Martial,"Well, yes, I suppose it could happen."
MCCOY,Court Martial,Not Captain Kirk.
MCCOY,Court Martial,But he's not that kind of a man.
MCCOY,Court Martial,Yes.
MCCOY,Court Martial,It's possible.
MCCOY,Court Martial,"Well, I had to see it to believe it."
MCCOY,Court Martial,"They're about to lop off the captain's professional head, and you're sitting here playing chess with the computer."
MCCOY,Court Martial,"Mister Spock, you're the most cold-blooded man I've ever known."
MCCOY,Court Martial,That's impossible.
MCCOY,Court Martial,So you tested the programme bank.
MCCOY,Court Martial,"Well, why are you just sitting there?"
MCCOY,Court Martial,"First, the Captain."
MCCOY,Court Martial,Mister Spock.
MCCOY,Court Martial,"And lastly, myself."
MCCOY,Court Martial,Indeed she is.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Yes, I know."
SHAW,Court Martial,Are you a friend of his?
SHAW,Court Martial,Areel Shaw.
SHAW,Court Martial,"And I'm a friend, too."
SHAW,Court Martial,An old one.
SHAW,Court Martial,Flattery will get you everywhere.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Four years, seven months, and an odd number of days."
SHAW,Court Martial,Not that I'm counting.
SHAW,Court Martial,"But things have changed for you, haven't they?"
SHAW,Court Martial,"I'm a lawyer in the Judge Advocate's office, remember?"
SHAW,Court Martial,You're taking it very lightly.
SHAW,Court Martial,Are you?
SHAW,Court Martial,That's not what the rumours indicate.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Jim, this could ruin you."
SHAW,Court Martial,Will you take some advice?
SHAW,Court Martial,The prosecution will build its case on the basis of Kirk versus the computer.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Now if your attorney tries to defend on that basis, you won't have a chance."
SHAW,Court Martial,"That's up to your attorney, and that's why he's got to be a good one."
SHAW,Court Martial,"No, I'm busy."
SHAW,Court Martial,"Jim, be serious."
SHAW,Court Martial,You're not an ordinary human.
SHAW,Court Martial,"You're a Starship Captain, and you've stepped into scandal."
SHAW,Court Martial,"If there's any way they can do it, they'll slap you down hard and permanently for the good of the service."
SHAW,Court Martial,"Samuel T. Cogley, attorney at law."
SHAW,Court Martial,"If anyone can save you, he can."
SHAW,Court Martial,He'll be paying you a visit.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Jim, I've got to go."
SHAW,Court Martial,"Because, Jim Kirk, my dear old love, I am the prosecution, and I have to do my very best to have you slapped down hard."
SHAW,Court Martial,"Broken out of the service, in disgrace."
SHAW,Court Martial,I call Mister Spock.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Mister Spock, as a First officer, you know a great deal about computers, don't you?"
SHAW,Court Martial,"It is possible for a computer to malfunction, is it not?"
SHAW,Court Martial,Do you know of any malfunction which has caused an inaccuracy in the Enterprise computer?
SHAW,Court Martial,"That answer is based on your mechanical survey of the Enterprise computer ordered by the defendant prior to this trial, is it not?"
SHAW,Court Martial,Now the stardate
SHAW,Court Martial,Why do you say that?
SHAW,Court Martial,"In other words, it reports that Captain Kirk was reacting to an extreme emergency that did not then exist."
SHAW,Court Martial,Is it?
SHAW,Court Martial,Were you watching him the exact moment he pressed the jettison button?
SHAW,Court Martial,Then how can you dispute the finding of the log?
SHAW,Court Martial,Oh?
SHAW,Court Martial,On what do you base that statement?
SHAW,Court Martial,Please instruct the witness not to speculate.
SHAW,Court Martial,I do not see what that has to
SHAW,Court Martial,In your opinion.
SHAW,Court Martial,Thank you.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Your witness, Mister Cogley."
SHAW,Court Martial,I now call the personnel officer for the Enterprise.
SHAW,Court Martial,"In the course of your duties as personnel officer of the Enterprise, you would be familiar with the service records of all aboard?"
SHAW,Court Martial,"With reference to Records Officer Finney, was there in his service record a reported disciplinary action for failure to close a circuit?"
SHAW,Court Martial,Was the charge in that instance based upon a log entry by the officer who relieved him?
SHAW,Court Martial,And who was that officer?
SHAW,Court Martial,"Louder, please, for the court."
SHAW,Court Martial,Now the Captain Kirk who sits in this courtroom?
SHAW,Court Martial,Thank you.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Do you wish to cross-examine, Mister Cogley?"
SHAW,Court Martial,I now call Doctor McCoy to the stand.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Doctor, you are, on the record, an expert in psychology, especially space psychology."
SHAW,Court Martial,Patterns which develop in the close quarters of a ship during long voyages in deep space.
SHAW,Court Martial,"You have just heard the testimony of your own personnel officer, that it was an action of the then Ensign Kirk, which placed an unerasable blot on the record of the then Lieutenant Finney."
SHAW,Court Martial,"Psychologically, Doctor, is it possible that Lieutenant Finney blamed Kirk for the incident?"
SHAW,Court Martial,"He could have hated Kirk down through the years, blamed him for being passed over for promotion, blamed him for never being given a command of his own, correct?"
SHAW,Court Martial,"Now, let us hypothesise, Doctor."
SHAW,Court Martial,Is it normal for a person to return affection for hatred?
SHAW,Court Martial,Do we not tend to at first resent and then actively dislike the person who hates us?
SHAW,Court Martial,Hypothetically.
SHAW,Court Martial,Would not Captain Smith begin to hate Lieutenant Commander Jones once he learned that Lieutenant Commander Jones hated and detested him?
SHAW,Court Martial,"Then I ask you, is it not possible that Captain Kirk became aware of Lieutenant Commander Finney's hatred toward him and perhaps, even involuntarily, began to reciprocate?"
SHAW,Court Martial,"Any normal human, Doctor."
SHAW,Court Martial,Is it possible?
SHAW,Court Martial,"Is it theoretically possible, Doctor?"
SHAW,Court Martial,Thank you.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Your witness, Mister Cogley."
SHAW,Court Martial,May it please the court.
SHAW,Court Martial,The prosecution concedes the inestimable record of Captain Kirk.
SHAW,Court Martial,Thank you.
SHAW,Court Martial,"The prosecution does not wish to dishonour this man, but facts are facts."
SHAW,Court Martial,I must invite the attention of the court and Captain Kirk to this visual extract from the Enterprise computer log.
SHAW,Court Martial,Play back.
SHAW,Court Martial,What you are about to see is precisely what took place on the Enterprise bridge during the ion storm.
SHAW,Court Martial,Reverse.
SHAW,Court Martial,Stop.
SHAW,Court Martial,Go forward with magnification on the panel.
SHAW,Court Martial,Freeze that.
SHAW,Court Martial,Captain Kirk is now signalling a Yellow Alert.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Go forward, normal view."
SHAW,Court Martial,Freeze that!
SHAW,Court Martial,"If the court will notice, the log plainly shows the defendant's finger pressing the jettison button."
SHAW,Court Martial,The condition signal reads Yellow Alert.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Not red alert, but simply Yellow Alert."
SHAW,Court Martial,"When the pod containing Lieutenant Commander Finney was jettisoned, the emergency did not as yet exist."
SHAW,Court Martial,"Sir, the prosecution rests."
SHAW,Court Martial,Objection!
SHAW,Court Martial,Counsel for the defence has rested his case.
SHAW,Court Martial,Mister Cogley is well-known for his theatrics.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Your Honour, that is ridiculous."
SHAW,Court Martial,We produced the witnesses in court.
SHAW,Court Martial,"My learned opponent had the opportunity to see them, cross-examine them."
SHAW,Court Martial,"I protest, Your Honour."
SHAW,Court Martial,Object!
SHAW,Court Martial,The witness would be making a conclusion.
SHAW,Court Martial,What does that mean?
SHAW,Court Martial,"Absolutely no objection, sir."
SHAW,Court Martial,How long will it be this time before I see you again?
SHAW,Court Martial,Sam Cogley asked me to give you something special.

SHAW,Court Martial,Do you think it would cause a complete breakdown of discipline if a lowly lieutenant kissed a Starship Captain on the bridge of his ship?
SHAW,Court Martial,And so must the Enterprise.
SHAW,Court Martial,"Goodbye, Jim."

COGLEY,Court Martial,You Kirk?
COGLEY,Court Martial,"I figure we'll be spending some time together, so I moved in."
COGLEY,Court Martial,What's the matter?
COGLEY,Court Martial,Don't you like books?
COGLEY,Court Martial,"A computer, huh?"
COGLEY,Court Martial,I got one of these in my office.
COGLEY,Court Martial,Contains all the precedents.
COGLEY,Court Martial,The synthesis of all the great legal decisions written throughout time.
COGLEY,Court Martial,I never use it.
COGLEY,Court Martial,I've got my own system.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Books, young man, books."
COGLEY,Court Martial,Thousands of them.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"If time wasn't so important, I'd show you something."
COGLEY,Court Martial,My library.
COGLEY,Court Martial,Thousands of books.
COGLEY,Court Martial,This is where the law is.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Not in that homogenised, pasteurised, synthesiser."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Do you want to know the law, the ancient concepts in their own language, Learn the intent of the men who wrote them, from Moses to the tribunal of Alpha 3?"
COGLEY,Court Martial,Books.
COGLEY,Court Martial,Right on both counts.
COGLEY,Court Martial,Need a lawyer?
COGLEY,Court Martial,No questions.
COGLEY,Court Martial,No questions.
COGLEY,Court Martial,No questions.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Well, sir, the truth is, I've been holding back till we get this preliminary business out of the way."
COGLEY,Court Martial,I'd like to call Captain Kirk to the stand.
COGLEY,Court Martial,I wouldn't want to slow the wheels of progress.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"But then on the other hand, I wouldn't want those wheels to run over my client in their unbridled haste."
COGLEY,Court Martial,Stop.
COGLEY,Court Martial,I think that's enough.
COGLEY,Court Martial,I wouldn't want to slow things up too much.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Now, Captain, despite what these machines indicate, was there indeed a Red Alert before you jettisoned the pod?"
COGLEY,Court Martial,Please tell us about it.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"You did the right thing, but would you do it again?"
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Your witness, Miss Shaw."
COGLEY,Court Martial,Computers don't lie.
COGLEY,Court Martial,I'm suggesting that maybe you did have a lapse.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"It was possible, you know, with the strain you were under."
COGLEY,Court Martial,There's still time to change our plea.
COGLEY,Court Martial,I could get you off.
COGLEY,Court Martial,You did.
COGLEY,Court Martial,Your professional career.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"There's no place to go, except back to court and hear the verdict."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"That's very commendable, Miss Finney, but most unusual."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"After all, Captain Kirk is accused of causing your father's death, and the evidence would indicate his guilt."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"No, but I may be getting ready."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Sir, the defence rests."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Sir, some new evidence has just been brought to my attention."
COGLEY,Court Martial,I'd like to ask the court to
COGLEY,Court Martial,"I can't tell you, I'll have to show you."
COGLEY,Court Martial,Is saving an innocent man's career a theatric?
COGLEY,Court Martial,i
COGLEY,Court Martial,"I'd be delighted to, sir, now that I've got something human to talk about."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Rights, sir, human rights."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"The Bible, the Code of Hammurabi and of Justinian, Magna Carta, the Constitution of the United States, Fundamental Declarations of the Martian colonies, the Statutes of Alpha Three."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Gentlemen, these documents all speak of rights."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Rights of the accused to a trial by his peers, to be represented by counsel, the rights of cross-examination, but most importantly, the right to be confronted by the witnesses against him, a right to which my client has been denied."
COGLEY,Court Martial,All but one.
COGLEY,Court Martial,The most devastating witness against my client is not a human being.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"It's a machine, an information system."
COGLEY,Court Martial,The computer log of the Enterprise.
COGLEY,Court Martial,Can ask this court adjourn and reconvene aboard that vessel.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"And I repeat, I speak of rights."
COGLEY,Court Martial,A machine has none.
COGLEY,Court Martial,A man must.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"My client has the right to face his accuser, and if you do not grant him that right, you have brought us down to the level of the machine."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Indeed, you have elevated that machine above us."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"I ask that my motion be granted, and more than that, gentlemen."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"In the name of humanity, fading in the shadow of the machine, I demand it."
COGLEY,Court Martial,I demand it!
COGLEY,Court Martial,"How many games of chess did you win from the computer, Mister Spock?"
COGLEY,Court Martial,May that be considered unusual?
COGLEY,Court Martial,Why?
COGLEY,Court Martial,Could that have had an effect on the visual playback we saw?
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Hypothetically, Mister Spock."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Hypothetically, Miss Shaw."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"If what you suggest had been done, it would be beyond the capabilities of most men."
COGLEY,Court Martial,Is that true?
COGLEY,Court Martial,What man aboard ship would it not be beyond?
COGLEY,Court Martial,"And at the moment, you have no records officer."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Captain Kirk, will you tell the steps you took to find Mister Finney after the storm?"
COGLEY,Court Martial,Describe a phase one search.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"It presupposes, does it not, that a man wishes to be found?"
COGLEY,Court Martial,"If you start a search for a man, you assume, don't you, that he wants to be found?"
COGLEY,Court Martial,He's not hiding?
COGLEY,Court Martial,"On a ship of this size, could a man evade such a search?"
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Gentlemen, I submit to you that Lieutenant Commander Ben Finney is not dead."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"You shall have it, but first I need the co-operation of this court in conducting an experiment."
COGLEY,Court Martial,Captain Kirk.
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Including myself, sir."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"I have an errand ashore of vital importance to the purpose of this court, and I will return."
COGLEY,Court Martial,"Thank you, sir."

FINNEY,Court Martial,"Aye, aye, sir."
FINNEY,Court Martial,"Hello, Captain!"
FINNEY,Court Martial,Nothing to say
FINNEY,Court Martial,Captain?
FINNEY,Court Martial,You mean you're relieved because you think your career is saved.
FINNEY,Court Martial,"Well, you're wrong."
FINNEY,Court Martial,Like you helped me all along?
FINNEY,Court Martial,Kept me down
FINNEY,Court Martial,Robbed me of my own command?
FINNEY,Court Martial,"I'm a good officer, as good as you."
FINNEY,Court Martial,I've watched you for years.
FINNEY,Court Martial,The great Captain Kirk.
FINNEY,Court Martial,They told you to do it to me.
FINNEY,Court Martial,You all conspired against me.
FINNEY,Court Martial,"You ruined me, but you won't do it anymore."
FINNEY,Court Martial,"Oh, I wouldn't kill you, Captain."
FINNEY,Court Martial,"Your own death would mean too little to you, But your ship"
FINNEY,Court Martial,It's dead.
FINNEY,Court Martial,I've killed it.
FINNEY,Court Martial,I tapped out your primary energy circuits.
FINNEY,Court Martial,You're out of power.
FINNEY,Court Martial,"I know the ship, too."
FINNEY,Court Martial,The Enterprise should've been mine.
FINNEY,Court Martial,You kept me from it.
FINNEY,Court Martial,Innocent?
FINNEY,Court Martial,"Officers and gentlemen, Captains all."
FINNEY,Court Martial,Except for Finney and his one mistake.
FINNEY,Court Martial,"A long time ago, but they don't forget."
FINNEY,Court Martial,But they are to blame.
FINNEY,Court Martial,All of them.
FINNEY,Court Martial,I was a good officer.
FINNEY,Court Martial,I really was.
FINNEY,Court Martial,I loved the service more than any man ever dared.
FINNEY,Court Martial,Why shouldn't I?
FINNEY,Court Martial,"They killed me, didn't they?"
FINNEY,Court Martial,It's a fair trade.
FINNEY,Court Martial,What do you mean?
FINNEY,Court Martial,What?
FINNEY,Court Martial,Why did you do that?
FINNEY,Court Martial,Why did you bring her here?
FINNEY,Court Martial,I'll kill you!

PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Welcome to Starbase Eleven, Captain."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","The
Commodore's waiting to see you."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","He's curious why you suddenly changed
course and came here."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","This base sent no message, Captain."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1",I recognized the Captain immediately.
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","A mutual friend described
you, sir."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Lieutenant Helen Johansson.
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","She merely mentioned she knew you, sir."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Oh, yes, sir."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I'm afraid our investigation turned up very
little, Commodore."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","There is, of course, Mister Spock's years of service
with Captain Pike."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Indications of his extreme loyalty to this former
commander."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","We're forced to consider every possibility, sir."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","We can be
certain Captain Pike cannot have sent a message."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","In his condition he's
under observation every minute of every day."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","With the flashing light, he can say yes or no."
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Commodore!
PIPER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Captain Pike, he's gone!"
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","We received a subspace message asking us to divert here
immediately."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Mister Spock received a starbase transmission, a message from the
former commander of the Enterprise, Fleet Captain Pike, urgently
requesting that we divert here."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",If my first officer states he received a transmission from
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Why?
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",When he was promoted to Fleet Captain.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",I took over the Enterprise from him.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Spock served with him for
several years."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Chris, if there's anything I can do for you."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","(flash, flash)"
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Once more, Jose."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Spock stated he received a
message for us to come here."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",He entered same in his log.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","That's all the
proof I require."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Then I suggest the record tapes have been deliberately changed.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","A
computer expert can change record tapes, duplicate voices, say
anything, say nothing."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","If he had wanted to see Captain Pike he could have requested a
leave."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",I would have granted it.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Who would want to divert us here?
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","There's no trouble in the space
sector we're patrolling now."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",No alien problems.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Helen described
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Miss Piper, a Vulcan can no sooner be disloyal than he can exist
without breathing."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","That goes for his present commander as well as his
past."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","There's no way he could even have asked for that message to be
sent?"
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",This is Captain Kirk.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","You have confirmation, Miss Uhura."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",(another chip) Mister Spock is with me here.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","He'll answer
all questions."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Kirk out.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","(watching Pike on monitor) He keeps blinking
no."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",No to what?
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",How long will he live?
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",He keeps blinking no.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Bones, could this have anything to do with Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",What I mean is either a message was received.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","It was one of two
things."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Either someone sent a message diverting us here, or someone on
board the ship lied about receiving it."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Could that someone be Mister
Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",He's also half human.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Someone's interfering with my command and my ship.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I don't know
who it is, but I mean to find out."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Even you.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","If I thought you had the
technical know-how I'd suspect you, but you don't."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Spock does.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","There's a false entry in the log right now which doesn't jibe
with the established facts."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",How do you explain that.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",(reading) For eyes of Starfleet Command only.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",What every ship Captain knows.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","General Order 7, no vessel under
any condition, emergency or otherwise, is to visit Talos Four."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","The Enterprise, commanded by Captain Christopher Pike."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Kirk to Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I'm recording you this message, Bones,
so there will be no misunderstanding."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I'm sorry to have to make it an
order."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You're not to disturb Captain Pike with any questions.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Simply
take good care of him."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Follow Spock's instructions to the letter.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Kirk
out."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","(flash, flash)"
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Spock is headed for Talos Four, all right."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Shuttlecraft to Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Shuttlecraft to Enterprise,
come in."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Enterprise, come in!"
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Blast you any way.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You had no right to come along.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Two hours of oxygen left.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Part of me is hoping the Enterprise won't come back for us.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","We
step on that deck, Spock is finished."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Court-martialed, disgraced."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Spock would have some logical reason for going there.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Store our shuttlecraft on the hangar
deck, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Beam us directly aboard.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Accepting command.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Where's Mister Spock?
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Reverse power.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Hold this position.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Tell whoever gave those orders
to report"
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Disengage computer control, Uhura."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Computer control, come in."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Disengage from helm.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",This is the Captain.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","On voice
command, you will override all contrary
instructions."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Voice command, disengage from helm."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",This hearing is convened.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Mister Spock,
you're aware of your right to counsel of your choice?"
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Request denied.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","A mutiny requires a trial board of no less than three command
officers."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Since there are only two of that rank available
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Denied.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Captain Pike is a complete invalid.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","By asking why, you've opened the door to any evidence he may wish
to present."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Apparently what he had in mind.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Screen off.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Chris, was that really you on the screen?"
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","(flash)
That's impossible."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Mister Spock, no vessel makes record tapes in that
detail, that perfect."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",What were we watching?
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I am forced to contest that, Commodore."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",I want to see more.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",That has nothing to do with it.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Screen on, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",We still haven't heard the full story.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",I vote to continue.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Not a deadlock.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","There's still one member of the trial board to be
heard from."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Yes.
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",What is it?
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Plead signal for you, sir."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Go ahead, Uhura."
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Receiving transmissions from Talos Four?
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Then the images we've
been seeing are"
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Do you know what you're doing?
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Have you lost your mind?
KIRK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Lock him up.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Oh, Jim, I just can't understand this."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Impossible.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Jim, I'm not doubting anyone's word."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I'm simply telling you
it's impossible."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You don't know?
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","You actually don't know what's happened to
Captain Pike?"
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",There's been subspace chatter about it for months.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",I'm sorry to have to be the one to show you.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","He's upstairs in the
medical section."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You ever met Chris Pike?
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",About your age.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Big, handsome man, vital, active."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Inspection tour of a cadet vessel.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Old Class J starship.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","One of
the baffle plates ruptured."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",He went in bringing out all those kids that were still alive.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Just wanted you gentlemen to be prepared.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Captain Pike.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","(a scarred head and shoulders
sticking out of wheelchair device) Captain, you remember these
gentlemen."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",They wanted to visit you.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Two flashes mean no.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I thought you
might make an exception for them."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","(flash, flash) I'm sorry, gentlemen."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",And what do those record tapes show?
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",No message sent from here.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",No message received by your vessel.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","The fact remains that your first officer's former captain is
hospitalised, horribly injured, at this base, and that same first
officer seems to be the only one who heard that message."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Well, that's true of course."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Computer Centre.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Have you rechecked all the record tapes on the date in
question?"
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Is there any way at all a message could have been sent
from here without us knowing it?"
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",All right.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Start checking the impossible.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Mendez out.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Oh, have I introduced Miss Piper, Jim?"
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","This
is Captain Kirk, Miss Piper."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","You have something to report, Miss Piper?"
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","And totally unable to move, Jim."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","His wheel chair is constructed
to respond to his brain waves."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Oh, he can turn it, move it forwards, or
backwards slightly."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","But that's it, Jim."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",That's as much as that poor devil can do.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","His mind is as active as yours and mine, but it's trapped inside a
useless vegetating body."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","He's kept alive mechanically, a battery-driven
heart."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Oh, I'm certifying I ordered you to read it."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Know anything at
all about this planet?"
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",And to do so is the only death penalty left on our books.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Only
Fleet Command knows why."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Not even this file explains that.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","(unlocks the
magnetic strip) But it does name the only Earth ship that ever visited
the planet."

MENDEZ,"The

MENDEZ,"The

MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","If you
read me, you are ordered to reply."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Repeating it on all emergency
frequencies, Jim."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Pulling ahead of us fast.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Fuel is down to sixty three point
three."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","If we turn back now, we've just got barely enough to get us back
to the base."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",We coast.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","RHIP, Captain."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Rank hath its privileges.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Wonderful.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",He's dead if he makes it to Talos Four.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Why would he want to
get Pike there?"
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","The command reports stated Talos contained absolutely
no practical benefits to mankind."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Maybe.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Maybe he's just gone mad.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","His quarters, after what he's done, Lieutenant?"
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","We didn't have the heart to retire him, Jim."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",He's got you.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Whatever he's up to, he's planned it well."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Mister Spock, are you aware in pleading
guilty that a further charge involving the death penalty must be held
against you should this vessel enter the Talos star group?"
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Why?
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","What does it accomplish to go there or to take Captain
Pike there?"
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",I want to know why.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Yes, it's on the record."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",For what purpose?
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Present your evidence.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Screen on.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Captain Pike, were any record tapes of this nature made during
your voyage?"
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","(flash, flash) The court is not obliged to view evidence
without knowing its source."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You mean I was maneuvered into asking.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Your evidence is out of
order."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","You have that right, Captain, but just because the prisoner is
your First Officer and your personal friend"
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Very well, continue."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Screen off.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Mister Spock, I'm truly amazed at your technical
prowess in somehow manufacturing all this."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I congratulate you on your
imagination."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","But this is a court of space law, not a theatre."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You're in no position to bargain.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",This is ridiculous.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","This man
mutinied, stole your ship, abducted Captain Pike."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Well, for me this has
gone far enough."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",And I vote we do not.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Deadlock, and since I'm"
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Very well.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Captain Pike, it's up to you."
MENDEZ,"The

these conditions?"

MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Screen on.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Mister Spock, you're aware of the orders regarding any contact
with Talos Four."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You have deliberately invited the death penalty.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","You've not only finished yourself, Spock, but you've finished your
Captain as well."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","And you're aware a Captain is responsible for everything that
occurs on his ship."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I order you to return this vessel back to manual
control."
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Very well.
MENDEZ,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You've earned the consequences.

I know."
SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

hour."
SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The

relatively simple."
SPOCK,"The

rest leave until our return."
SPOCK,"The

orders as you would his."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",First Officer out.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",And no one from the ship made such a call.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Doctor, I regret they elected to keep certain things from you."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Will you come with me, please."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Doctor, one moment, please."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Take no action, Mister Hansen."
SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Doctor, as senior officer present, I present
myself to you for arrest."
SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I never received orders to take
command."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Doctor.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Adequate, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",I'll make no trouble.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Sir, I waive counsel."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Further, I waive rights to this hearing
and request immediate court-martial."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","May I inquire on what grounds, Captain?"
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Sir, I must point out that there are three officers of command
rank available."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Yourself, Commodore Mendez, and Captain Christopher
Pike."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",I believe you'll find he's still on the active duty list.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",I am.
SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Thank you.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Request monitor screen be engaged.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","To comply with the request you just made, sir, that I explain
the importance of going to Talos Four."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",This is thirteen years ago.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","The Enterprise and its commander,
Captain Christopher Pike."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this
way."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I cannot tell you at this time, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Unless the court asks a prisoner why, Commodore."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","You did ask
that question."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","As I stated, gentlemen, this was thirteen years ago."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","We were on
routine patrol when the ship's sensors detected something ahead."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","At
first we were not certain what it was."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Their call letters check with a survey expedition.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","S.S. Columbia
disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Records show the Talos group has never been explored.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Solar

SPOCK,"The

SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","We aren't going to go, to be certain?"
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Mister Spock here.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","We're intercepting a follow-up
message, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",There are crash survivors on Talos.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Captain, please tell the court this is not imagination, nor some
clever photographic record."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Are we seeing the actual events of thirteen
years ago?"
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","(flash) Yes, gentlemen."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","On that screen as it happened, the
incredible experience of Captain Christopher Pike on Talos Four."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","If,
after witnessing this, the court wishes to turn this vessel back, I
will release this ship to manual control."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Preliminary lab survey ready, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Yes, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Spock here.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","There is no survivors' encampment, Number One."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","This
is all some sort of trap."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",We've lost the Captain.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Do you read?
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Are coming from Talos Four, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","The Commodore must be aware that Captain Kirk knew nothing of
this."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Sir, I respectfully decline."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Captain, Jim, please don't stop me."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Don't let him stop me.
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","It's
your career and Captain Pike's life."
SPOCK,"The
Menagerie, part 1","You must see the rest of the
transmission."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","What's his problem, Commodore?"
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",The delta rays?
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",They've tried questioning him.
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","He's almost agitated himself into
a coma."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",As long as any of us.
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Blast medicine anyway.
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","We've learned to
tie into every human organ in the body except one."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",The brain.
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","The brain
is what life is all about."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Now, that man can think any thought that we
can, and love, hope, dream as much as we can, but he can't reach out,
and no one can reach in."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",No to what?
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","They could question him for days, weeks, before they
stumble on the right thing."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I don't read you at all, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Jim, forgetting how well we both know Spock, the simple fact
that he's a Vulcan means he's incapable of telling a lie."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",And that half is completely submerged.
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","To be caught acting like
us or even thinking like us would completely embarrass him."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",He would not make a false entry.
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I can't, but to question Spock of all people?"
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Me, yes."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I could
run off half-cocked given a good reason."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","So could you, but not Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",It's impossible.
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",McCoy here.
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Well, what is it?"
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Sickness?
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Injury?
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",How bad is it?
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Probably somebody discovered a hangnail.
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I'll beam up and let
you know, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",What's going on around here?
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Who said Jim needed a medical rest
leave?"
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",And this call about me being needed aboard the ship.
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I've
checked everywhere."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",That's right.
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","What is this, Spock?"
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Captain, are you all
right?"
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","(flash, flash) I see that you're still signaling"
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I keep wondering who might be after us in a
shuttlecraft and I keep coming up with the same answers, but I can't be
right, can l, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Is it the captain, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You what?
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Mister Spock is, er, under arrest."
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Is confinement to quarters
enough?"
MCCOY,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Well, confine him."

Menagerie, part 1",Good.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the
Vega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","What the devil are you putting in there, ice?"
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",What makes you think I need one?
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Shouldn't it be?
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","My only yeoman and two others dead, seven
injured."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the
armour."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted
fortress and attacked by one of their warriors."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You bet I'm tired.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You bet.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I'm tired of being responsible for
two hundred and three lives."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I'm tired of deciding which mission is too
risky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who
doesn't, and who lives and who dies."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Boy, I've had it, Phil."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",To the point of considering resigning.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Well, for one thing, go home."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Nice little town with fifty miles
of park land around it."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Remember I told you I had two horses, and we
used to take some food and ride out all day."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",I said that's one place I might go.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I might go into business on
Regulus or on the Orion colony."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",The point is this isn't the only life available.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","There's a whole
galaxy of things to choose from."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Address intercraft.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",This is the captain.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Our destination is the Talos star group.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Our time warp, factor seven."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Engage.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Spectography?
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Gravity?
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Prep a landing party of six.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You feel up to it?
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Sorry, Number One."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","With little information on this planet, we'll
have to leave the ship's most experienced officer here covering us."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","There's no indication of problems down there,
but let's not take chances."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Right.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Captain Christopher Pike, United Space Ship Enterprise."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",(as the survivors pack up the settlement) Enterprise.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","We'll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to
you very shortly."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Yes, affirmative on the"
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Er, affirmative on request."
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Landing party out.
PIKE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","I, I don't understand."
COMM OFFICER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","It's a radio wave, sir."
COMM OFFICER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","We're passing through an
old-style distress signal."
COMM OFFICER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir."
COMM OFFICER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","That's
it."
COMM OFFICER,"The
Menagerie, part 1",No other message.
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Boyce here.
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",I understand we picked up a distress signal.
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Oh, I concur with yours, definitely."
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Who wants a warm martini?
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Sometimes a man will tell his bartender things he'll never tell
his doctor."
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel seven?"
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it?
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet."
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","You
treat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now
you're tired and you"
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave?"
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",And do what?
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Ah, that sounds exciting."
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Ride out with a picnic lunch every day.
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves?"
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Not for you.
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets
it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to
wither away."
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Take your choice.
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",We both get the same two kinds of customers.
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1",The living and the dying.
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","If they can, er, spare you a moment, I'd like to make my medical
report."
BOYCE,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Their health is excellent, almost too good."
OFFICER,"The
Menagerie, part 1",(reads) Eleven survivors from crash.
OFFICER,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Gravity and oxygen within limits.
OFFICER,"The
Menagerie, part 1","Food and water obtainable, but
unless."

HASKINS,"The
Menagerie, part 1","She was born almost as we
crashed."
HASKINS,"The
Menagerie, part 1","You must forgive her choice of words, Captain."
HASKINS,"The
Menagerie, part 1","She's lived her
whole life with a collection of aging scientists."
HASKINS,"The
Menagerie, part 1","There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt
if Earth is ready to learn the secret."
HASKINS,"The

HASKINS,"The
Menagerie, part 1","We'll
accept your judgment."
SURVIVOR,"The

VINA,"The
Menagerie, part 1","A prime
specimen."
VINA,"The
Menagerie, part 1",I think it's time to show the Captain our secret.
VINA,"The
Menagerie, part 1","You're tired, but don't worry."
VINA,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You'll feel much better soon.
VINA,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Don't you see it?
VINA,"The
Menagerie, part 1",Here and here.
VINA,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You will.
VINA,"The
Menagerie, part 1",You're a perfect choice.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Anything from the landing party?
KIRK,Shore Leave,A kink in my back.
KIRK,Shore Leave,(behind his back the Yeoman starts to massage it) That's it.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"A little higher, please."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Push.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Push hard.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Dig it in there, Mister"
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Thank you, Yeoman."
KIRK,Shore Leave,That's sufficient.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"I have enough of that from Doctor McCoy, Yeoman."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Thank you.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Have Doctor McCoy's report channeled to my quarters, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Captain's log.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Stardate 3025 er, point 3."
KIRK,Shore Leave,We are orbiting an uninhabited planet in the Omicron Delta region.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"A planet remarkably like Earth, or how we remember Earth to be."
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Park-like, beautiful, green, flowers, trees, green lawn, quiet and restful."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Almost too good to be true.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"I may be tired, Yeoman, but I'm not falling apart."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Dismissed.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Mister Spock, we're beaming down the starboard section first."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Which section would you like to go with?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Kirk here.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Yes.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Open a channel, Uhura."
KIRK,Shore Leave,"I hadn't planned to, Bones."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Why?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Explain.
KIRK,Shore Leave,That's pretty good.
KIRK,Shore Leave,I got one for you.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"The rabbit was followed by a little blonde girl, right?"
KIRK,Shore Leave,"All right, Doctor, I'll take your report under consideration."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Captain out.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"That's a McCoy pill, with a little mystery sugar-coating."
KIRK,Shore Leave,He wants to get me down there.
KIRK,Shore Leave,I'm afraid I won't swallow it.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?"
KIRK,Shore Leave,That's much too low a rating.
KIRK,Shore Leave,A crewman's right ends where the safety of the ship begins.
KIRK,Shore Leave,That man will go a shore on my orders.
KIRK,Shore Leave,What's his name?
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Rodriguez, Teller, everything all right?"
KIRK,Shore Leave,Good.
KIRK,Shore Leave,That should be sufficient.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Beam it up to Mister Spock when you're ready, and start enjoying yourselves."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Thank you.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Restful.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"After what we've been through, it's hard to believe a place this beautiful exists."
KIRK,Shore Leave,McCoy!
KIRK,Shore Leave,McCoy!
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Bones, know any good rabbit jokes lately?"
KIRK,Shore Leave,Footprints.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Could be a rabbit.
KIRK,Shore Leave,It would have to be an unusual creature to make this size tracks.
KIRK,Shore Leave,What about Mister Sulu?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Will he confirm what you saw?
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Bridge, this is the Captain."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Has the first shore party beamed down yet?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Get this message to all shore parties.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Stand by.
KIRK,Shore Leave,No one is to leave the ship.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"You're the doctor, Doctor."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Can you explain this?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Neither can I. I admit it looks harmless.
KIRK,Shore Leave,It probably is harmless.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"But before I bring my people down here, I want proof it's harmless."
KIRK,Shore Leave,What do you think you're doing?
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Where did you get it, Mister Sulu?"
KIRK,Shore Leave,(holding out his hand for the offending weapon) Mister Sulu.
KIRK,Shore Leave,I'll hang on to it.
KIRK,Shore Leave,The fresh air seems to have made you trigger-happy.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Are you sure our instruments didn't show any animal life on this planet?
KIRK,Shore Leave,"I'd like to believe this is an elaborate gag, but."
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Yeoman Barrows, you accompany Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Find out where those tracks came from.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Doctor, you come with me back to the glade."
KIRK,Shore Leave,I'd like another look at that area.
KIRK,Shore Leave,This is turning out to be one very unusual shore leave.
KIRK,Shore Leave,How?
KIRK,Shore Leave,"What's the matter, Bones, you getting a persecution complex?"
KIRK,Shore Leave,I know the feeling very well.
KIRK,Shore Leave,I had it at the Academy.
KIRK,Shore Leave,An upper classman there.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"One practical joke after another, and always on me."
KIRK,Shore Leave,My own personal devil.
KIRK,Shore Leave,A guy by the name of Finnegan.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Serious?
KIRK,Shore Leave,"I'll make a confession, Bones."
KIRK,Shore Leave,"I was absolutely grim, which delighted Finnegan no end."
KIRK,Shore Leave,He's the kind of guy to put a bowl of cold soup in your bed or a bucket of water propped on a half-open door.
KIRK,Shore Leave,You never knew where he'd strike next.
KIRK,Shore Leave,More tracks.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Looks like your rabbit came from over there.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Yes.
KIRK,Shore Leave,You follow the rabbit.
KIRK,Shore Leave,I'll backtrack the girl.
KIRK,Shore Leave,I'll meet you around the other side of the hill.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Finnegan?
KIRK,Shore Leave,I can't believe it.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"All right, let's try that one again."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Go!
KIRK,Shore Leave,Yeoman Barrows.
KIRK,Shore Leave,What happened?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Who was?
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Barrows, give me a report."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Are you sure you're not imagining all this?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Mister Sulu was with you.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Where is he now?
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Stay with her, Doctor."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Mister Sulu!
KIRK,Shore Leave,Sulu!
KIRK,Shore Leave,Mister Sulu!
KIRK,Shore Leave,Sulu!
KIRK,Shore Leave,Sulu!
KIRK,Shore Leave,Ruth?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Ruth.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"(into communicator) McCoy, do you read me?"
KIRK,Shore Leave,Ruth.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Ruth, how can it be you?"
KIRK,Shore Leave,How could you possibly be here?
KIRK,Shore Leave,You haven't aged.
KIRK,Shore Leave,It's been fifteen years.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Kirk here.
KIRK,Shore Leave,What?
KIRK,Shore Leave,"No, but I'm sure he's all right."
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Yes, I'm fine."
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Yes, Mister Rodriguez."
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Don't you like birds, Mister Rodriguez?"
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Mister Rodriguez, have the search parties rendezvous at the glade."
KIRK,Shore Leave,I'd like some answers to all this.
KIRK,Shore Leave,I don't want to.
KIRK,Shore Leave,You haven't told me.
KIRK,Shore Leave,You haven't told me
KIRK,Shore Leave,Ruth.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Kirk here.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Yes, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Specify.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Can you pinpoint the source?
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Keep me posted, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Shore Leave,We'll continue our investigation down here.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Captain out.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"You're the science officer, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Shore Leave,I want some answers.
KIRK,Shore Leave,First there was McCoy's Alice in Wonderland where there was supposedly no animal life.
KIRK,Shore Leave,And Sulu's gun where there's no refined metal detected.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Rodriguez' birds.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"And then my, well, the two people I saw."
KIRK,Shore Leave,One hallucination flattened me with a clout on the jaw.
KIRK,Shore Leave,The other.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Yes.
KIRK,Shore Leave,I'm already on maximum.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Negative.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Our people here are armed with phasers.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Besides, there's yet to be any real danger."
KIRK,Shore Leave,(he sees geese flying overhead) Captain out.
KIRK,Shore Leave,McCoy.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"McCoy, do you read me?"
KIRK,Shore Leave,Kirk to McCoy.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Come in.
KIRK,Shore Leave,A what?
KIRK,Shore Leave,I do.
KIRK,Shore Leave,I've met some interesting personalities myself.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Have you seen any of the others while I've been gone?
KIRK,Shore Leave,I hope he got through to everybody.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Communications are almost out.
KIRK,Shore Leave,(Kirk checks his own weapon - nothing)  Yeah.
KIRK,Shore Leave,We'd better get to the glade.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Trying to.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Something's obstructing it.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"(finally the familiar shape fully materialises) Mister Spock, my orders were no one was to leave the ship."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Good.
KIRK,Shore Leave,We can use your help.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Until we can find out what this is all about.
KIRK,Shore Leave,That way.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Spread out.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Let's find it.
KIRK,Shore Leave,No.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Yeoman!
KIRK,Shore Leave,We're in trouble.
KIRK,Shore Leave,I need every crewman alert and thinking.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Neither do I, Mister Sulu, but before we leave this planet, I will."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Tricorder?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Mister Spock.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"(Spock and Sulu swap places, handing over the tricorder) What do you make of that?"
KIRK,Shore Leave,"I want an exact judgment, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Are you saying this is a plant, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Shore Leave,By who?
KIRK,Shore Leave,And why?
KIRK,Shore Leave,And why these particular things?
KIRK,Shore Leave,McCoy's body?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Spock?
KIRK,Shore Leave,McCoy's death is a scientific fact.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"I was, I was thinking about the Academy."
KIRK,Shore Leave,My days
KIRK,Shore Leave,Finnegan.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Finnegan!
KIRK,Shore Leave,What's been happening to my people?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Take Sulu.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Find McCoy's body.
KIRK,Shore Leave,This man is my problem.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"That's an order, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Shore Leave,I want some answers.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Can you feel that?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Finnegan.
KIRK,Shore Leave,One thing
KIRK,Shore Leave,Answers.
KIRK,Shore Leave,A lot of things.
KIRK,Shore Leave,What's been happening to my people?
KIRK,Shore Leave,I'm not a plebe.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"This is today, fifteen years later."
KIRK,Shore Leave,What are you doing here?
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Yes, I enjoyed it."
KIRK,Shore Leave,After all these years.
KIRK,Shore Leave,(realisation dawns) I did enjoy it.
KIRK,Shore Leave,The one thing I wanted to do after all these years was to beat the tar out of Finnegan.
KIRK,Shore Leave,That we're all meeting people and things that we happen to be thinking about at the moment.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Dangerous if we happen to be thinking about
KIRK,Shore Leave,Difficult.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Spock.
KIRK,Shore Leave,We've got to get back to the landing party and warn them.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Sulu, Rodriguez, Barrows."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Front and centre.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Don't ask any questions, Sulu."
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Face front, everyone."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Don't talk.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Don't breathe.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Don't think.
KIRK,Shore Leave,You're at attention.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Concentrate on that and only that.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Concentrate.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Who are you?
KIRK,Shore Leave,You know my name?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Amuse?
KIRK,Shore Leave,That's your word for what we've been through?
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Yes, play, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Shore Leave,"The more complex the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play."
KIRK,Shore Leave,But that still doesn't explain the death of my ship's surgeon.
KIRK,Shore Leave,You say your people built all this.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Who are you?
KIRK,Shore Leave,What planet are you from?
KIRK,Shore Leave,Kirk here.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"No, everything is in order, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Shore Leave,Stand by.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Lieutenant.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Commence transporting shore leave parties.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Tell them to prepare for the best shore leave they've ever had.
KIRK,Shore Leave,Kirk out.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"No, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Shore Leave,I'll go.
KIRK,Shore Leave,You.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"(then he sees Ruth walking towards the group) On the other hand, I'll stay for a day or two."
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Yes, we did, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Shore Leave,I think we did.
KIRK,Shore Leave,"Ahead warp factor one, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"They should be sending up a report momentarily, Captain."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,(Kirk stretches and groans) Something wrong?
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"After what this ship has been through in the last three months, there is not a crewman aboard who is not in need of rest."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Myself excepted, of course."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Not necessary in my case, Captain."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"On my planet, to rest is to rest, to cease using energy."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"To me, it is quite illogical to run up and down on green grass using energy instead of saving it."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Very well, Captain."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Something I did come to discuss.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,I picked this up from Doctor McCoy's log.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,We have a crewmember aboard who's showing signs of stress and fatigue.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Reaction time down nine to twelve percent, associational reading norm minus three."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"He's becoming irritable and quarrelsome, yet he refuses to take rest and rehabilitation."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Now, He has that right, but we've found"
SPOCK,Shore Leave,James Kirk.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Enjoy yourself, Captain."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,It's an interesting planet.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,You'll find it quite pleasant.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Very much like your Earth.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Scouts have detected no animals, artefacts, or force fields of any kind."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Only peace, sunshine, and good air."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,You'll have no problems.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Captain.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"I'm getting strange readings from the planet surface, Captain."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Some sort of power field down there.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"A highly sophisticated type of energy draining our power and increasing, beginning to affect our communications."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Could be coming from beneath the planet's surface.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Patterns indicate some sort of industrial activity.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Any chance these could be hallucinations?
SPOCK,Shore Leave,That sounds like a painful reality.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,There must be some logical explanation.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Your signal is very weak.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Can you turn up your gain?
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Captain, shall I beam down an armed party?"
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Necessary, Captain."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Unable to contact you by communicator, and the transporter is useless to us now."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"As I told you before, there's an unusual power field down here."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,It's soaking up all the energy at the source.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"I calculated the rate of its growth, and reasoned that I just might be able to transport one more person."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"This is not human skin tissue, Captain."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,It more closely resembles the cellular casting we use for wound repairs.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Much finer, of course."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,This is definitely a mechanical contrivance.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"It has the same basic cell structure as the plants here, even the trees, the grass."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,I'm saying that these are all multicellular castings.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"The plants, the animals, the people."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,They're all being manufactured.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,All we know for certain is that they act exactly like the real thing.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Just as pleasant or just as deadly.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"At this point, Captain, my analysis may not sound very scientific."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"There is one slight possibility, very slim, but nevertheless."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Captain, what were your thoughts just before you encountered the people you described?"
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Captain, wait."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Did you enjoy it, Captain?"
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Which supports a theory I've been formulating.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Yes.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Somehow our thoughts are read, these things are quickly manufactured and provided for us."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Yes.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,We must all control our thoughts.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"The force field we encountered is obviously underground, manufacturing these things."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Passages lead to the surface.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Just for example, when Rodriguez thought of a tiger"
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Captain.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,The term is amusement park.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,An old Earth name for a place where people could go to see and do all sorts of fascinating things.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,I tend to agree.
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"(handing the girl over to Sulu) Captain, I'll go back aboard ship and take over."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"With all due respect to the young lady, I've already had as much shore leave as I care for."
SPOCK,Shore Leave,"Did you enjoy your rest, gentlemen?"
SPOCK,Shore Leave,Most illogical.
TONIA,Shore Leave,"You need sleep, Captain."
TONIA,Shore Leave,If it's not out of line
TONIA,Shore Leave,"Sir, I don't see your name in any of the shore parties."
TONIA,Shore Leave,"Aye, aye, sir."
TONIA,Shore Leave,It is beautiful.
TONIA,Shore Leave,"So lovely, and restful."
TONIA,Shore Leave,"I mean, affirmative, Captain."
TONIA,Shore Leave,Where is Mister Sulu?
TONIA,Shore Leave,"Doctor McCoy's rabbit, sir."
TONIA,Shore Leave,He must have gone through here.
TONIA,Shore Leave,I don't know.
TONIA,Shore Leave,I mean I do know.
TONIA,Shore Leave,"I was following the tracks, and there he was."
TONIA,Shore Leave,Him.
TONIA,Shore Leave,"He had a cloak, sir, and a dagger with jewels on it."
TONIA,Shore Leave,"Captain, I know it sounds incredible, but I did not imagine it any more than I imagined he did this."
TONIA,Shore Leave,Yes.
TONIA,Shore Leave,Yes.
TONIA,Shore Leave,"It was so sort of story book walking around here, and I was thinking, all a girl needs is Don Juan."
TONIA,Shore Leave,"Just day dreaming, the way you would about someone you'd like to meet."
TONIA,Shore Leave,He ran after him.
TONIA,Shore Leave,"A little, but I wouldn't want to be alone here."
TONIA,Shore Leave,That's just it.
TONIA,Shore Leave,It's almost too beautiful.
TONIA,Shore Leave,"I was thinking, even before my tunic was torn, that in a place like this a girl should be, oh let's see now, a girl should be dressed like a fairy-tale princess, with lots of floaty stuff and a tall hat with a veil."
TONIA,Shore Leave,"Is that a promise, Doctor?"
TONIA,Shore Leave,"Oh, Doctor, they're lovely."
TONIA,Shore Leave,"Look at me, Doctor."
TONIA,Shore Leave,A lady to be protected and fought for.
TONIA,Shore Leave,A princess of the blood royale.
TONIA,Shore Leave,"Doctor, I'm afraid."
TONIA,Shore Leave,"All right, but you stay right there."
TONIA,Shore Leave,Don't peek.
TONIA,Shore Leave,There's no one here.
TONIA,Shore Leave,Don't talk like that.
TONIA,Shore Leave,He's dead.
TONIA,Shore Leave,It's my fault.
TONIA,Shore Leave,It never would have happened.
TONIA,Shore Leave,It's my fault.
TONIA,Shore Leave,"It is, it is."
TONIA,Shore Leave,I'm to blame.
TONIA,Shore Leave,"Aye, aye, sir."
TONIA,Shore Leave,"The black knight, too."
TONIA,Shore Leave,(not amused) And how do you explain them?
TONIA,Shore Leave,And so am l.
UHURA,Shore Leave,"Aye, aye, Captain."
UHURA,Shore Leave,"Doctor McCoy calling from the planet, Captain."
UHURA,Shore Leave,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,Shore Leave,Bridge.
UHURA,Shore Leave,"Negative, Captain."
UHURA,Shore Leave,They're just about to start.
UHURA,Shore Leave,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,Shore Leave,"This is the bridge, Captain."
UHURA,Shore Leave,Our power systems have just come back in.
UHURA,Shore Leave,Do you require assistance?
UHURA,Shore Leave,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,Shore Leave,Sir?
SULU,Shore Leave,"Beautiful, beautiful."
SULU,Shore Leave,"No animals, no people, no worries."
SULU,Shore Leave,Just what the doctor ordered.
SULU,Shore Leave,"Right, Doctor?"
SULU,Shore Leave,Do you think the Captain will authorise shore leave here?
SULU,Shore Leave,He'd like it.
SULU,Shore Leave,To get some cell-structure records.
SULU,Shore Leave,"A blade of grass, a bush, a tree, a flower petal."
SULU,Shore Leave,"With these, we can tell the whole planet's biology."
SULU,Shore Leave,What is it?
SULU,Shore Leave,What's the matter?
SULU,Shore Leave,See what?
SULU,Shore Leave,I don't see anything.
SULU,Shore Leave,"What is it, Doc?"
SULU,Shore Leave,"Target shooting, Captain."
SULU,Shore Leave,Isn't it a beauty?
SULU,Shore Leave,Haven't got anything like this in my collection.
SULU,Shore Leave,I found it.
SULU,Shore Leave,"I know it's a crazy coincidence, but I've always wanted one like this."
SULU,Shore Leave,Found it lying right over there.
SULU,Shore Leave,"An old-time police special, and in beautiful condition."
SULU,Shore Leave,Hasn't been one like this made in a couple of centuries.
SULU,Shore Leave,(handing it over) It fires lead pellets propelled by expanding gases from a chemical explosion.
SULU,Shore Leave,"Captain, take cover!"
SULU,Shore Leave,There's a Samurai after me.
SULU,Shore Leave,"I mean, there was."
SULU,Shore Leave,"(no one is chasing him now) Captain, you've got to believe me."
SULU,Shore Leave,Got a call a few minutes ago.
SULU,Shore Leave,Rodriguez.
SULU,Shore Leave,Said you were rendezvousing back at the glade.
SULU,Shore Leave,That's not all.
SULU,Shore Leave,So's my phaser.
SULU,Shore Leave,"Yes, sir."
SULU,Shore Leave,(sound of a transporter beam) Look.
SULU,Shore Leave,Someone beaming down from the bridge.
SULU,Shore Leave,"We're stranded down here, Captain?"
SULU,Shore Leave,(at the knight's body) Captain!
SULU,Shore Leave,Captain!
SULU,Shore Leave,"You'd better have a look at this, sir."
SULU,Shore Leave,(the knight is a plastic dummy) I don't understand.
SULU,Shore Leave,"It's like a dummy, Captain."
SULU,Shore Leave,It couldn't be alive.
SULU,Shore Leave,"Still operating, sir."
SULU,Shore Leave,Captain!
SULU,Shore Leave,He's gone.
SULU,Shore Leave,Dragged off.
SULU,Shore Leave,Sir.
SULU,Shore Leave,Play?
SULU,Shore Leave,"As advanced as you obviously are, and you still play?"
MCCOY,Shore Leave,I couldn't have prescribed better.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,We are one weary ship.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Depending upon my report and that of the other scouting parties.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"You know, you have to see this place to believe it."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,It's like something out of Alice in Wonderland.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,The Captain has to come down.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,He needs it.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"You've got your problems, I've got mine."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"He's got ours, plus his, plus four hundred and thirty other people's."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Where are you going?
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Sulu!
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Did you see them?
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"Captain, are you beaming down?"
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"Well, either our scouting probes and detectors are malfunctioning, and all us scouts careless and beauty-intoxicated, or I must report myself unfit for duty."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"On this supposedly uninhabited planet, I just saw a large rabbit"
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Pull a gold watch from his vest and claim that he was late.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"As a matter of fact, yes."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,And they disappeared through a hole in a hedge.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Over here.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Over here.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"As a matter of fact, I do, but this is not one of them."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Look at this.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"(a pair of large tracks in the soil) I saw what I saw, or maybe I hallucinated it, but I want you to take a look and tell me what you think about it."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Negative.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,He was examining the flora at the time.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Collecting specimens.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"You're cancelling the shore leave on account of this, Jim?"
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"Well, no."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Absolutely.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"No birds, no mammals, no insects, nothing."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,I'm certain our readings weren't off.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"Well, it could have been worse."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,You could have seen the rabbit.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"Well, yeah, I'm beginning to feel a little bit picked on, if that's what you mean."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,And you being the very serious young
MCCOY,Shore Leave,A girl's footprints.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,The young blonde girl I saw chasing it.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Good.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"I've got a personal grudge against that rabbit, Jim."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,What was it?
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Sounds like Don Juan.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"Did you find Mister Sulu, Captain?"
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Did you find Mister Sulu?
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Sir?
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Are you all right?
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Feeling better?
MCCOY,Shore Leave,It's a beautiful place.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"A little strange, I'll admit."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"I see what you mean, but then you'd have whole armies of Don Juans to fight off."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"And me, too."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,You are all of those things and many more.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,They'll look even lovelier with you wearing them.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"Now, look, I don't know how or why, but the dress is here."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,I'd like to see you in it.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Why don't you put it on?
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"My dear girl, I am a doctor."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"When I peek, it's in the line of duty."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,McCoy here.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,I can't read you very well.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Is this Rodriguez?
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Right.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,What the devil's wrong with communications?
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Esteban.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Esteban.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,This is where the Captain said to rendezvous.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,(makes Tonia stand with her back to a tree) I swear I heard someone moving around.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"A princess shouldn't be afraid, not with a brave knight to protect her."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,These things cannot be real.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Hallucinations can't harm us.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Go back to where you were.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"Possibly because no one has died, Jim."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,(Strolls in with a lovely girl on each arm) I was taken below the surface for some rather remarkable repairs.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,It's amazing.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,They've got a factory complex down there you wouldn't believe.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,They can build or do anything immediately.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Oh.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,Them.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"Well I, er, I was thinking about a little cabaret I know on Rigel Two, and, er, there were these two girls in the chorus line."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"And well, here they are."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"Well after all, I am on shore leave."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"Oh, yes."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,So you are.
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"Well, girls, I suppose you can turn something up."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"It's what the doctor ordered, Jim."
MCCOY,Shore Leave,"Indeed we did, Mister Spock."
RABBIT,Shore Leave,"Oh, my paws and whiskers!"
RABBIT,Shore Leave,I'll be late.
ALICE,Shore Leave,"Excuse me, sir."
ALICE,Shore Leave,Have you seen a rather large white rabbit with a yellow waistcoat and white gloves here about?
ALICE,Shore Leave,Thank you very much.
TELLER,Shore Leave,(the woman) Does it always have to be work with you?
TELLER,Shore Leave,There's so much loveliness.
TELLER,Shore Leave,What is it?
TELLER,Shore Leave,Can it hurt us?
TELLER,Shore Leave,A what?
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,"You won't find all this so lovely if our report for the Captain isn't ready when he asks for it, which shouldn't be long."
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,"Yes, sir."
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,We've completed the specimen survey.
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,"Thank you, sir."
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,"And sir, I think you'll find Doctor McCoy and Mister Sulu that way."
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,Calling Doctor McCoy.
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,This is all the volume I can get on this thing.
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,"Can't read you well, either."
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,Captain's orders.
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,Rendezvous at that glade where he first found you.
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,Of all the crazy things.
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,"Remember what I was telling you a while ago, about the early wars and funny air vehicles they used?"
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,That's one of them.
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,Not unless it makes a strafing run.
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,The way they used to attack people on the ground.
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,(the plane descends) Come on.
RODRIGUEZ,Shore Leave,Angela.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,(in a dreadful cod-Irish accent) Jim.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"You never know when I'm going to strike, huh, Jim?"
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,(hits him on the jaw) How's this?
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"Come on, come on."
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"It's me, Finnegan."
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"All right, Jimmy boy."
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"(maniacal laughter) Go ahead, lay one on me."
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"That's what you always wanted, isn't it?"
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Come on.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Come on.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Go!
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"Any excuse, Jim baby."
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Run away!
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Run away!
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Run away!
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"Hey, Jim baby!"
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,I see you brought out reinforcements.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Ha!
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"Well, I'm waiting for you, Jimmy boy."
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Here I am!
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Run!
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Jim!
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Find me!
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Can't you see me?
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Come and get me!
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Here I am!
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Come on.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,You never could find your head with both hands!
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"Like it used to be, Jimmy."
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Remember?
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"(finally Kirk catches up to him, because he's lounging on a ledge) Hey, Jim"
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Coming up.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Get up.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Get up.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Get up.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"Always fight fair, don't you?"
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"True officer and gentleman, you."
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,You stupid underclassman.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,I've got the edge.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,I'm still twenty years old.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Look at you.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,You're an old man.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,I can't move me leg.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,I can't feel me leg.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,My back is broken.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,You've broken me back.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"Can you feel that, now?"
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"(Kirk passes out) Sleep sweet, Jimmy boy."
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Sleep as long as you like.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"Sleep forever, Jim boy."
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Forever and forever.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"Won't you ever learn, Jim boy?"
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"You never could take me, you know."
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Sure.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Name it.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Earn them!
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,Not bad.
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"Kind of makes up for things, huh, Jim?"
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"I never answer questions from plebes, Jimmy boy."
FINNEGAN,Shore Leave,"I'm being exactly what you expect me to be, Jimmy boy."
RUTH,Shore Leave,"Jim, darling, it is me."
RUTH,Shore Leave,It is Ruth.
RUTH,Shore Leave,It doesn't matter.
RUTH,Shore Leave,None of that matters.
RUTH,Shore Leave,You have to go?
RUTH,Shore Leave,You'll see me again if you want to.
RUTH,Shore Leave,"Do what you have to do, and I'll be waiting."
RODRIQUEZ,Shore Leave,Rodriguez to Captain Kirk.
RODRIQUEZ,Shore Leave,"Captain, a while ago, I saw well, birds, a whole flock of them."
RODRIQUEZ,Shore Leave,"I like them fine, sir, but all our surveys showed"
RODRIQUEZ,Shore Leave,"Sir, our surveys couldn't have been that wrong."
RODRIQUEZ,Shore Leave,"Aye, aye, sir."
RODRIQUEZ,Shore Leave,Doctor.
RODRIQUEZ,Shore Leave,Doctor.
RODRIQUEZ,Shore Leave,Doctor McCoy!
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,"I'm the caretaker of this place, Captain Kirk."
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,But of course.
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,"Lieutenant Rodriguez, Lieutenant Sulu, Yeoman Barrows and Mister Spock."
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,We've just discovered you don't understand all this.
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,These experiences were intended to amuse you.
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,But none of this is permanent.
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,"Here you have to only imagine your fondest wishes, either old ones you wish to relive or new ones, anything at all."
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,"Battle, fear, love, triumph."
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,Anything that pleases you can be made to happen.
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,Of course.
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,This entire planet was constructed for our race of people to come and play.
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,"Exactly, Captain."
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,How very perceptive of you.
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,We regret that some of you've been made uncomfortable.
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,"My impression is that your race is not yet ready to understand us, Captain."
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,However.
CARETAKER,Shore Leave,"If you would use the proper caution, this amusement planet of ours could be an ideal place for your people to enjoy themselves, if you wish."
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,"All clear ahead, Captain."
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,The sensors indicate zero register.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,"No, sir."
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,Forward sweeps are negative.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,Wait.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,"Verified, sir."
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,We must be in some sort of light warp or we'd have picked it up earlier.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,"Iron-silica body, planet sized, magnitude one E. We'll be passing close."
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,"Mister Spock, they're gone!"
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,"No sign of human life on the surface, sir."
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,Unless the instruments aren't functioning.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,"With due respect, sir."
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,Request permission to transport to the surface immediately and carry out a search.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,"Some kind of a joke, sir?"
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,DeSalle to Enterprise.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,DeSalle to Enterprise.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,It doesn't function.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,We're cut off.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,(to Jaeger) Keep trying with yours.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,Something's blocking the beacon.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,I've got to find open ground.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,Mister Jaeger!
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,McCoy!
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,Look.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,"We've lost contact with the ship, Captain."
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,We're trapped here.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,"My ancestry is French, yes."
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,(getting up) You
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,"Captain, subspace interference is clearing."
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,Large body ahead.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,There it is again.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,Dead ahead.
DESALLE,The Squire of Gothos,"Approach channels clear, Captain."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Forward readings, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Ahead warp factor three, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Colony Beta Six wants their supplies.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Let's get across this void in a hurry.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Sunlight, palm trees."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"We're nine hundred light years from that kind of desert, Bones."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Something, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Can you verify that, Navigator?"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Put it on visual.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"And yet, here it is."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,No time to investigate.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Science stations, gather data for computer banks."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Uhura, notify the discovery on subspace radio."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Let's get out of its range.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Veer forty degrees to starboard, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Sulu!
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,What happened?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Fill me in.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Starship Enterprise.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Who are you?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Where do you come from?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Then you've been looking in on the doings nine hundred years past.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,General Trelane.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,For what purpose have you imprisoned us here?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"When we do battle, it is only because we have no choice."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I must ask you to let us go back to our ship.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Not yet.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Put it on stun, not to kill, DeSalle."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"This is Mister DeSalle, our navigator."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Doctor McCoy, our medical officer."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Mister Sulu, our helmsman, and Carl Jaeger, meteorologist."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Who will you start with, my crew?"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Are we your next targets?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,That's correct.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Like the transporter system aboard the Enterprise.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"This drawing room, did you create it by rearranging matter on this planet?"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I see.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,How did you manage
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Come on, let's go."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,We're getting out of here.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Not alive?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Fire without heat, mistaking all this for present day Earth without taking into account the time differential."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Whatever we're dealing with, he certainly isn't all knowledgeable."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,He makes mistakes.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Trelane, we haven't planned"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"If your admiration is genuine, you must have respect for our sense of duty too."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Our ship has need of us.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,We have tasks to perform.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,For how long?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Until what is over?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Trelane, even if we wanted to stay, our companions are missing us."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,There are four hundred men and women aboard that ship.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,(grabbing his arm) No.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,This game has gone on long enough.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Those are crucial operating personnel.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,You can't
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"It means, Trelane, the party's over, thanks to Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Everyone to stations.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Report, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,How were our scanners able to penetrate that radiation field?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Prepare to warp out of here at once.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Maximum speed.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Scotty, we're going to need every ounce of your engines."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,We're going to put a hundred million miles between us and that madman.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Trelane.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,On the contrary.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I commend his action.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Get off my ship.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,We're not going anywhere.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,DeSalle.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Trelane, let him go."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,This is General Trelane.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Lieutenant Uhura of communications.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,No doubt.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,(holding Trelane back) Yeoman Teresa Ross.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I believe you have met our science officer Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Until we can think our way out.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Meanwhile, we accept his hospitality."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"You don't find this unexpected, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"And if he's fallible, he can't be all powerful."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Which means he has something helping him.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,A machine?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,A device?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Something which does these things for him.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,That mirror.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"It's part of his audience, his ego."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,He never wanders from it.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Explain.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,What about it?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"No, no, Mister Spock, that's not the reason."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,What kind of a machine could do these things?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Good.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I agree.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,That leaves me free
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"If I'm not mistaken, Mister Spock, I think I can turn his lights off at the source."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"(raises his voice) Don't be too upset by what you see, gentlemen."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"After all, his actions are those of an immature, unbalanced mind."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,You only heard part of it.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I just started.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Yes.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I want you to leave my crewmen alone.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I want you to leave my crewwomen alone too.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,(to Ross) You're not to dance with him.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I don't like it.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"(removing one of her long gloves) I don't want you accepting his gifts, either."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"I don't care what you believe, just keep your hands off her!"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I've had enough of your insulting attentions to her.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"If it's fighting that you want, (slaps Trelane) you may have it."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,If you have the courage.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Are you ready?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Enough talk.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Let's get on with it.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,We shoot together.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,All right.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Try to contact the ship.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Go on, Trelane."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Look at it.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,It's over.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Your power is blanked out.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,You're finished.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Trelane!
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Everyone, we're getting out of here."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Now.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,This is the Captain.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Commence beaming up.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Maximum speed.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Set course for Colony Beta Six.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Full power acceleration from orbit, Mister Scott."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Emergency warp at the earliest possible moment, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Not yet.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,They may trace our beam.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Wait until we're well out of range.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,We can take an educated guess.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,At the point we entered their solar system.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Good.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Yes, I think you might."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Turn in your glass slippers.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,The ball is over.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Hard to believe it ever happened.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Hard to port, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Gothos?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Mister Sulu, have we been going in circles?"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Hard over, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,With us as the mouse.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Ninety degrees to starboard, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Ninety degrees sub-port, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Adjust.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Decelerate into orbit.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Prepare transporter room.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Yes, I am, Doctor McCoy."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I am going to see our playful Mister Trelane and whatever it takes to make him give up our ship.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Stand by communications.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"If you don't receive a message from me within the hour, leave the vicinity at once."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,No turning back.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Trelane.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I've had enough of your games.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"I haven't come to plead in your court, Trelane."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I've come for one purpose.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,To get back my ship.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"We've made you angry with our will to survive, haven't we?"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Then vent your anger on me alone.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I was the one who led the others.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I was the one who shot out your mirror machine.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I took that chance.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I'm willing to pay the price for chancing wrong.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Yes, anything!"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Just allow the Enterprise to continue its journey.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,You pompous
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Those people have done you no harm.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"We're living beings, not playthings for your amusement."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I'm glad you weren't disappointed.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Trelane, if you think I'm going to cheerfully and obediently stick my head in that noose"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"That's your problem, Trelane."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Everything is easy.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,It's given you a bad habit.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"You're not aware of it, but you have it."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"You don't think, Trelane."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,That's your problem.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"You miss opportunities, like your anger before and mine right now."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, you enjoy it, but you couldn't have accomplished it without me, and you know why?"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Because you're a bumbling, inept fool."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Here you have an opportunity to experience something really unique, and you're wasting it."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,You want to commit murder?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Go ahead, but where's the sport in a simple hanging?"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Yes.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,The terror of murder.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,The suspense.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,The fun.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,A personal conflict between us.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Not like the duel before, but the real thing."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"The stakes, a human life."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Mine.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,That's the idea.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Yes, but you can do better than that."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,There's still not enough sport in just killing me with a sword.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,It strikes me very well.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"But you'll have to make it worth my while, Trelane."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Why not up the stakes?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Yes.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"While we're playing our game, free my ship."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Let it continue on its way.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"In return, I'll give you a contest you'll remember."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Let me notify the Enterprise that it can go.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Enterprise.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Enterprise, can you hear me?"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Enterprise.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Enterprise.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Remember, Trelane."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,You promised to let my ship go.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"You haven't won, Trelane."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,But you haven't won anything.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,No!
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Does it still taste as sweet?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,But I'm not defeated.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"You've got a lot to learn about winning, Trelane."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"In fact, you've got a lot to learn about everything, haven't you?"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Who are you?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Who is Trelane?
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Captain to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Captain to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Beam me up, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,We're free to go.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Normal orbit approach procedures, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Still thinking about Trelane, is that it?"
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"God of war, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Then a small boy, and a very naughty one at that."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Then he was a very strange small boy.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"One the other hand, he was probably doing things comparable to the same mischievous pranks you played when you were a boy."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Yes.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Dipping little girls' curls in inkwells.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Stealing apples from the neighbours' trees.
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,Tying cans on
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,"Forgive me, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Squire of Gothos,I should have known better.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Gravimetric readings, no significant change, zero space density."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"The precise meaning of the word desert is a waterless, barren wasteland."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,I fail to understand your romantic nostalgia for such a place.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Thank you, Doctor McCoy."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Moving on schedule into quadrant nine oh four.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Beta Six is eight days distant.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Unusual, Captain."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,I'm now getting a sizable space-displacement reading.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Inconceivable this body has gone unnoted on all our records.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Emergency!
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Full reverse power!
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Function is normal.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Continuous sensor sweeps.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Lieutenant Uhura, have you checked all wave bands?"
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"The decision will be mine, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,I have the responsibility for your safety.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"(to Sulu's replacement) Mister Jaeger, describe your geophysical findings for the surface below."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Estimate survival time of two unprotected individuals down there.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Greetings and felicitations.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Hmm.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Send this, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,USS Enterprise to signaler on planet surface.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Identify self.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Hip hip hoorah?
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,And I believe it's pronounced tally ho.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"I'll entertain any theories, Mister DeSalle."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Any at all.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"You're quite correct, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Prepare transporter room.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"No, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Neither you nor I can be spared here.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Mister DeSalle, equip the landing party with full communications, armament, and life-support gear."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Mister Jaeger, your geophysical knowledge may be crucial down there."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Doctor McCoy will accompany.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"If those peculiar signals are coming from Captain Kirk or Lieutenant Sulu, their rationality is in question."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Dismissed.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Very good.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Transmit coordinates to Mister Scott.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Once on the planet's surface, you'll establish contact with us immediately."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Use the laser beacon if necessary.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Ready, Scott?"
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Activate.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"I don't, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,It simply exists.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Artificial perhaps, or a freak of nature."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,The fact remains that life can exist in that area.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Apply a fine tuning on our sensors.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Locate any life forms in that stable area.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Affirmative.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"But if the Captain is down there and alive, that's where he'll have to be."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,We'll attempt to transport up any living beings our sensors detect.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Or stand by and do nothing, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"They didn't, Captain."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Not clearly.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,We merely beamed up all life forms in a given area.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,I am Spock.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,My father is from the planet Vulcan.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Not generally.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,But there have been exceptions.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Affirmative.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,I object to you.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,I object to intellect without discipline.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,I object to power without constructive purpose.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"It may be unappetizing, Doctor, but it is very logical."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Fascinating is a word I use for the unexpected.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"In this case, I should think interesting would suffice."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"That his food has no taste, his wine no flavour?"
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,No.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"It simply means that Trelane knows all of the Earth forms, but none of the substance."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Evidently.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Is it ego, or something else?"
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,The mirror.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,You noted yourself he never gets very far from it.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,I suppose it could be vanity.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,A machine with the ability to turn energy into matter guided by thought waves.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"It would have a very complex memory bank, and would be extremely sophisticated."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,I think not.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,A device capable of keeping out this planet's natural atmosphere would be immense.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Free, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Captain.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,The machine.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Can we know his range is, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Collision course.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"That was the planet Gothos, Captain."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Gothos again, Captain."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Cat and mouse game.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Or it toward us.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Captain, we're receiving you."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Captain.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"For the record, how do we describe him?"
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Pure mentality?
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Force of intellect?
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Embodied energy?
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,Superbeing?
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"He must be classified, sir."
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,I hardly find that fitting.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,It will make a strange entry in the library banks.
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"Mischievous pranks, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Squire of Gothos,"I shall be delighted, Captain."
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"Void, star desert."
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"The word conjures up pictures of dunes, oases, mirages."
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"That doesn't surprise me, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,I can't imagine a mirage ever disturbing those mathematically perfect brain waves of yours.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,I second DeSalle's request.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,What are we waiting for?
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,One thing is certain.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,Obviously there's life on that planet.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"Where are your storms, Jaeger?"
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,(trying his own communicator) No response.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"In the name of heaven, where are we?"
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,There's no reading.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,They're like waxworks figures.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,You disappeared from the bridge after Sulu.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,We've been looking for you for four hours.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"Better say, what is he?"
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"I monitored him, and what I found was unbelievable."
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,Not in the way we define life.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,No trace.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,Zero.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"It doesn't even show that he exists at all, alive or dead."
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"Captain, receiving a transporter signal."
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"Which means Trelane is not a life form as we know it, or he'd be beaming through now."
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"I'm quaking, but I don't know if it's from laughter or terror."
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"Well, it was a. Oh, forget it."
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,You should taste his food.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"Straw would taste better than his meat, and water a hundred times better than his brandy."
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,Nothing has any taste at all.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,There's that magic word again.
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"Does your logic find this fascinating, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,The Squire of Gothos,"Captain, you're not beaming down."
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,"Strong interference on subspace, Captain."
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,The planet must be a natural radio source.
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,"All of them, Mister Spock."
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,No response.
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,Mister Spock.
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,Look.
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,"No more messages from below, sir, but I've locked onto their original source."
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,"Doctor, what was it?"
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,What was down there?
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,I don't know how to play this.
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,"Shall I make a full report to Spacefleet Command, sir?"
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,Still no sign of pursuit.
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,"Instruments clear, sir."
UHURA,The Squire of Gothos,"Colony Beta Six clears us for normal approach, sir."
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,Forty degrees.
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,Where are we?
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,Is he kidding?
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,"Captain, where could he possibly come from?"
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,Who is this maniac?
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,"You mean, it shows he's dead?"
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,No.
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,We haven't even got our phasers.
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,"Captain, how far do we go along with this charade?"
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,"Laid in, sir."
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,"Standing by to warp, sir."
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,"Captain, we're about to warp."
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,"No, sir."
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,All instruments show on course.
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,"Turning, Captain."
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,Nut not veering off from it.
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,"Turn completed, and still accelerating toward the planet."
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,"Warping down, Captain."
SULU,The Squire of Gothos,Our warp factor four.
SCOTT,The Squire of Gothos,We've searched again from stem to stern.
SCOTT,The Squire of Gothos,"If they're not down on that planet, they're nowhere."
SCOTT,The Squire of Gothos,"Request assignment to the search party, sir."
SCOTT,The Squire of Gothos,"Ready, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,The Squire of Gothos,"Aye, it's there, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,The Squire of Gothos,"Peaceful as Earth, but how do you explain it?"
SCOTT,The Squire of Gothos,"Aye, it could, but it couldn't move around much."
SCOTT,The Squire of Gothos,"If we find any, it doesn't follow that it would be our people."
SCOTT,The Squire of Gothos,"Shooting in the dark, Mister Spock?"
SCOTT,The Squire of Gothos,"Aye aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Squire of Gothos,"Full power, sir."
JAEGER,The Squire of Gothos,No detectable soil or vegetation.
JAEGER,The Squire of Gothos,"Extremely hot, toxic atmosphere swept by tornadic storm."
JAEGER,The Squire of Gothos,Continuous volcanic eruptions.
JAEGER,The Squire of Gothos,Deadly to any lifeforms such as we know it without oxygen and life-support systems.
JAEGER,The Squire of Gothos,Not very long.
JAEGER,The Squire of Gothos,Atmosphere exactly the same as ours.
JAEGER,The Squire of Gothos,"Notice the period, Captain."
JAEGER,The Squire of Gothos,Nine hundred light years from Earth.
JAEGER,The Squire of Gothos,It's what might be seen through a viewing scope if it were powerful enough.
JAEGER,The Squire of Gothos,"I'm a scientist, not a military man."
JAEGER,The Squire of Gothos,"Notice the wood fire, Captain?"
JAEGER,The Squire of Gothos,"Burning steadily, ember bed glowing, and it doesn't give off any heat at all."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"I must say, they make a perfectly exquisite display pair, but I suppose you want them back now."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Welcome to an island of peace on my stormy little planet of Gothos.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"You must excuse my whimsical way of fetching you here, but when I saw you passing by I simply could not resist."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Ah, so you're the Captain of these brave lads."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"My greetings and felicitations, Captain."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,So good of you and your officers to drop in.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Absolutely smashing.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I can't tell you how delighted I am to have visitors from the very planet that I've made my hobby.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Yes, but according to my observations, I didn't think you capable of such voyages."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Ah, yes."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I've been looking in on the doings on your lively little Earth.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, really?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Have I made an error in time?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,How fallible of me.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, I did so want to make you feel at home."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I'm quite proud of the detail.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Retired, sir."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Just Squire Trelane now.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,And you may call me Squire.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Yes, I rather fancy that."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Imprisoned?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Nonsense.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You're my guests.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"You see, I just finished my studies of your curious and fascinating society."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You came by at the most propitious moment.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"I want to know all about your campaigns, your battles, your missions of conquest."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Ah, but that's the official story, eh?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I wouldn't hear of it.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You shall join me in a repast.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I want to learn all about your feelings on war and killing and conquest.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,That sort of thing.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Do you know that you're one of the few predator species that preys even on itself?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"DeSalle, did you say?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Un vrai Francais?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Ah, monsieur."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Vive la gloire.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Vive Napoleon.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"You know, I admire your Napoleon very much."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Welcome, good physicianer and honourable sir."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,(bows low)
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Und Offizier Jaeger, und der deutsche Soldat, nein?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"(gives a little Prussian salute then marches around) Eins, zwei, drei, vier."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Gehen vir mit dem Schiessgewehr.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Oh come now.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,We're all military men under the skin.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,And how we do love our uniforms.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,What an interesting weapon you've got there.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Do let me see it.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,: Yes.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Now let me see.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,How does this work?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Ah, yes."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"This won't kill, and this will."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, how marvellous!"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,(destroys another exhibit) Devastating!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Why, this could kill millions."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, how absolutely typical of your species."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"You don't understand something, so you become fearful."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Now, do let me anticipate your next question."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You want to know how I've managed all of this.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"We, meaning I and others, have, to state the matter briefly, perfected a system by which matter can be transferred to energy and back to matter again."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, a crude example of an infinitely more sophisticated process."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"You see, we not only transport matter from place to place, but we can alter its shape at will."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Quite.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Dear Captain, your inquiries are becoming tiresome."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I want you to be happy.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Free yourself of care.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Let's enjoy ourselves in the spirit of martial good fellowship.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Tut, tut, tut."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You're being quite rude.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You can't go.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Apparently, you need another demonstration of my authority."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Yes, quite."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Discussing deep laid plans, I'll wager."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I cannot wait to see them evolve.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Tut tut.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Do not think that I deplore your martial virtue of deception and stratagem.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Quite the contrary.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I have nothing but admiration for your whole species.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, I can't let you go now."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I was getting a bit bored until you came.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You must stay.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I insist.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Until this is over, of course."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Dear Captain, so many questions."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Make the most of an uncertain future.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Enjoy yourself today.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Tomorrow may never come at all.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Yes, I must experience your sense of concern, your grief at the separation."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Women?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Do you mean that you actually have members of the fairer sex among your crew?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, how charming."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,And they must be all very beautiful.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,And I shall be so very gallant to them.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Here, let me fetch them down at once."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,No?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I can do anything I want.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I should think you would have realised that by now.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Transporter signal?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,What does he mean?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You must tell me!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,(as the group is beamed away) Wait!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I won't have this!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I haven't dismissed you yet.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Stop!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I won't have this!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Where are all your weapons, Captain?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Don't you display your weapons?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Don't fret, Captain."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"I'm only a bit upset with you, but this Mister Spock you mentioned, the one responsible for that unseemly, impudent act of taking you from me, which is he?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Surely not an officer.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"He isn't quite human, is he?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,And are its natives predatory?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Really?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You will see to his punishment?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,But I don't like him.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, rot!"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You're all going back with me.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Nonsense.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"I have an absolutely enchanting sojourn on Gothos planned for all of you, and you shan't spoil it for me."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Anyway, the decor of my drawing room is much more appropriate"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,And tasteful.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Don't you agree?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"But so much more fitting, honourable sir."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, what primitive fury."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Why, he's the very soul of sublime savagery."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Yes, of course."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I forget that I shouldn't frighten you too much.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"But I warn you, you can't provoke me again."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Come, everyone."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Let's forget your bad manners.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Let's be full of merry talk and sallies of wit.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,We have victuals to delight the palate and brave company to delight the mind.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Come, Doctor, do partake."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Ah, you've been quite derelict in your social duties, Captain."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You haven't introduced me to the charming contingent of your crew.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Retired.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"But if you prefer, you may address me as the lonely Squire of Gothos, dear ladies."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Ah a Nubian prize.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"(he kisses her hand) Taken on one of your raids of conquest, no doubt, Captain."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,She has the melting eyes of the queen of Sheba.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,The same lovely colouring.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,And this.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Is this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Fair Helen, make me immortal with a kiss."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"You do realise, don't you, that it's in deference to the Captain that I brought you here?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I don't know if I like your tone.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,It's most challenging.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"That's what you're doing, challenging me?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, Mister Spock, you do have one saving grace after all."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You're ill-mannered.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"The human half of you, no doubt."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"(to Ross) Ah, come, my little wood nymph."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Won't you dance with your swain?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"(to Uhura) Give us some sprightly music, my dear girl."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Of course you do.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Ah, my dear, don't we make a graceful pair?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Except for one small detail.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,That dress hardly matches this charming scene.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Ah, yes, that's more what we want."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,The dashing warrior and his elegant lady.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"I overheard that remark, Captain."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I'm afraid I'll have to dispense with you.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Oh?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Does it actually make you angry, Captain?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Well, I do believe the dear Captain is jealous of me."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, how curiously human."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,How wonderfully barbaric.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Of course you have.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"After all, that's the root of the matter, isn't it?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"You fight for the attention, the admiration, the possession of women."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Are you challenging me to a duel?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, this is better than I'd planned."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I shall not shirk an affair of honour.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,A matched set.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Just like the pair that slew your heroic Alexander Hamilton.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"And Captain, I never miss."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, how fascinating."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I'm party to an actual human duel.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Quite ready, sir."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"We shall test each other's courage and then, and then we shall see."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"As you will, sir."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Honour will be served, eh?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, wait!"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"As the one challenged, I claim the first shot."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"It's my game and my rules, but if you need to be persuaded."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,(aims at Spock)
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"And now, Captain, how do you have the expression?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,My fate is in your hands.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You've ruined everything!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, the remarkable treachery of the species."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You've earned my wrath.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Go back.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Go back to your ship, all of you, and prepare."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You're all dead men.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"You especially, Captain."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,The prisoner may approach the bench.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Any attempt at demonstrations will weigh against you with the court, and this time my instrumentality is unbreakable."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, the absurdity of these inferior beings."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"(reading from the charge sheet) And now, Captain James Kirk, you stand accused of the high crime of treason against a superior authority, conspiracy, and the attempt to foment insurrection."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,How do you plead?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I warn you.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Anything you might say has already been taken down in evidence against you.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Irrelevant.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Uncalled for.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,And did you really think that was the only medium of instrumentality at my command?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, then you do admit to the charge?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Immaterial!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Inadmissible!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Silence!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,This trial is over.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You are guilty.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"On all counts, you are guilty."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"And according to your own laws, this court has no choice in fixing punishment."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"You will hang by the neck, Captain, until you are dead, dead, dead!"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Until a moment ago, I didn't think it possible, but it was."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,(takes off his robes and wig) I did it.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I was angry.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I actually experienced genuine rage.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,This experiment has been successful.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Why, Captain, you're still angry."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Would that I could have sustained that moment.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Ah, no matter."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Do you have a last request?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You still haven't learned.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You have no choice.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, this is becoming quite tiresome."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,It's all so very easy.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Take care, now."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,The sport?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, I'm intrigued."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Go ahead, Captain."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,What do you suggest?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,(waving a sword around) Yes!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Yes!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, then you approve?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I know.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,That will be dull.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,We'll have to have something more fanciful.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Let me see.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,A hunt.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,A royal hunt.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Predator against predator.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Now, you may go hide in the forest anywhere you like and I shall seek."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"How does that strike you, Captain?"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,The stakes?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Always back to your ship.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Oh well.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"If it will add spice to the pursuit, I accept your terms, Captain."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Remember, you must try not to let me find you too quickly."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,At your convenience.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Ah-ha!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Ah ha!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Captain Kirk.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"You must try harder, Captain."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,This is too easy.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Touche, Captain."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Touche.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I must confess you scored first.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"But after all, I never played this game before."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,And now let's have at it again!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Ah-ha!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Tallyho!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"(iron grids pen Kirk in) You made a noble fight of it, Captain."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Yes, but this is such sport."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I must fetch all the others back to play.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,So this is victory.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,It has a sweet taste.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Down, Captain."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,On your knees!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I have.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I could run you through!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"On your knees, Captain!"
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I order you.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You've been beaten.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I order you!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I order you!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,(Kirk disarms him and snaps the sword across his knee) You broke it!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You broke my sword!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You dare to defy me!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I'll fix you for that!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You cheated!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You haven't played the game right.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I'll show you!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,No!
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,No.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You said I could have this planet.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You always stop me when I'm having fun.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"But I don't want to come in, and I won't."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"I'm a general, and I won't listen to you."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,But why?
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I didn't do anything wrong.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I was just playing.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,But I haven't finished studying my predators yet.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, but I was winning."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I was winning.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"No, no."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You saw.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, but you said I could."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,You promised.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I never have any fun.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,"Oh, but you saw."
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I was winning.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I would have won.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,Honest.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I would have.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I would have.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I would have.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I would.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I would.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I would.
TRELANE,The Squire of Gothos,I would.
ROSS,The Squire of Gothos,"(a blonde yeoman) Oh, Captain, I was so worried."
ROSS,The Squire of Gothos,Look.
ROSS,The Squire of Gothos,"Captain, please don't do this."
ROSS,The Squire of Gothos,May I take a moment to change?
ROSS,The Squire of Gothos,"Gladly, Captain."
MOTHER,The Squire of Gothos,Trelane.
MOTHER,The Squire of Gothos,"Time to come in now, Trelane."
MOTHER,The Squire of Gothos,"If you cannot take proper care of your pets, you cannot have them at all."
MOTHER,The Squire of Gothos,"You'll grow up, Trelane."
MOTHER,The Squire of Gothos,You'll understand.
MOTHER,The Squire of Gothos,Now come along.
MOTHER,The Squire of Gothos,"No, Trelane."
MOTHER,The Squire of Gothos,You must forgive our child.
MOTHER,The Squire of Gothos,The fault is ours for indulging him too much.
MOTHER,The Squire of Gothos,He will be punished.
MOTHER,The Squire of Gothos,"Forgive us, Captain."
MOTHER,The Squire of Gothos,We will maintain your life-support conditions while you return to your ship.
MOTHER,The Squire of Gothos,Please accept our apologies.
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,This has gone far enough.
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,You're disobedient and cruel.
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,We've told you before.
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,"Enough, Trelane."
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,Come along.
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,"We said, come along."
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,This is not studying them.
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,"They're beings, Trelane."
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,They have spirit.
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,They're superior.
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,"Stop that nonsense at once, or you'll not be permitted to make any more planets."
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,"No, Trelane."
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,"Captain, we regret that the life paths of yourself and your companions have been disturbed."
FATHER,The Squire of Gothos,We would not have let him intercept you had we realised your vulnerability.
KIRK,Arena,You'll enjoy Commodore Travers.
KIRK,Arena,He sets a good table.
KIRK,Arena,Probably.
KIRK,Arena,Rank hath its privileges.
KIRK,Arena,Scotty.
KIRK,Arena,Kirk here.
KIRK,Arena,"Good, Commodore."
KIRK,Arena,We're on our way.
KIRK,Arena,"We'll beam down immediately, Commodore."
KIRK,Arena,Kirk out.
KIRK,Arena,"This colony is isolated, exposed, out on the edge of now here."
KIRK,Arena,He probably wants additional advice.
KIRK,Arena,Energise.
KIRK,Arena,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Arena,Red alert.
KIRK,Arena,Cestus Three has been destroyed.
KIRK,Arena,Full alert.
KIRK,Arena,"Tricorder readings, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Arena,Life detection.
KIRK,Arena,Faked.
KIRK,Arena,All this happened several days ago.
KIRK,Arena,"(to a man in a yellow shirt) Lang, over there."
KIRK,Arena,Look for survivors.
KIRK,Arena,"Kelowitz, (blue shirt) that way."
KIRK,Arena,"(to the red shirt) O'Herlihy, stick with me."
KIRK,Arena,"Come on, Bones."
KIRK,Arena,"Keep him alive, Bones."
KIRK,Arena,I want to know what's been happening here.
KIRK,Arena,Survivors?
KIRK,Arena,Where?
KIRK,Arena,O'Herlihy.
KIRK,Arena,Cover!
KIRK,Arena,"Kirk to Enterprise, lock on transporters."
KIRK,Arena,Beam us up.
KIRK,Arena,Keep those screens up.
KIRK,Arena,Fire all phasers.
KIRK,Arena,Take all action necessary to protect the ship.
KIRK,Arena,We'll hold out here.
KIRK,Arena,Keep those screens up.
KIRK,Arena,Worry about us when the ship is safe.
KIRK,Arena,Kirk out.
KIRK,Arena,"If they lower those screens to beam us up, they'll be open to phaser attack."
KIRK,Arena,"We're stuck with it, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Arena,We'll have to make do with what we've got.
KIRK,Arena,"Kelowitz, Lang, flank out."
KIRK,Arena,Lay down fire on co-ordinates Mister Spock gave you.
KIRK,Arena,Even if you don't see them.
KIRK,Arena,Keep your heads down.
KIRK,Arena,We're helpless down here.
KIRK,Arena,And the Enterprise
KIRK,Arena,"It's my ship, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Arena,I should be there.
KIRK,Arena,We can't even get at them.
KIRK,Arena,Can you remember the layout of this place?
KIRK,Arena,The arsenal?
KIRK,Arena,I'll risk it.
KIRK,Arena,Kirk here.
KIRK,Arena,Report.
KIRK,Arena,Never mind about me.
KIRK,Arena,What about the ship?
KIRK,Arena,Arm your photon torpedoes.
KIRK,Arena,Any identification on the attacking vessel?
KIRK,Arena,Sulu.
KIRK,Arena,"Sulu, our communications are being interfered with."
KIRK,Arena,(An explosion makes him run further on into an old bomb crater) Now get this straight.
KIRK,Arena,You do anything you think necessary to protect the ship.
KIRK,Arena,"Leave orbit, maximum warp, anything."
KIRK,Arena,Clear?
KIRK,Arena,Never mind about me.
KIRK,Arena,Protect my ship!
KIRK,Arena,Good.
KIRK,Arena,Contact me when you can.
KIRK,Arena,Kirk out.
KIRK,Arena,We'll see how ingenious they are.
KIRK,Arena,"Here, give me a hand with this grenade launcher."
KIRK,Arena,Lang!
KIRK,Arena,Sulu's taken her out of orbit.
KIRK,Arena,Did you see them?
KIRK,Arena,"An evaluation, Mister Kelowitz."
KIRK,Arena,Where do you think they are?
KIRK,Arena,It'll be a lot closer to them.
KIRK,Arena,Stand clear.
KIRK,Arena,Kirk here.
KIRK,Arena,"Lock on to the alien, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Arena,I don't want to lose her.
KIRK,Arena,I want a search party of thirty medical personnel beamed down immediately to search for survivors.
KIRK,Arena,Notify the transporter room.
KIRK,Arena,Lock onto us.
KIRK,Arena,We're beaming up.
KIRK,Arena,Can you tell me what happened?
KIRK,Arena,"Yes, I know."
KIRK,Arena,Easy.
KIRK,Arena,Easy.
KIRK,Arena,"Lieutenant, the Enterprise received two messages, ostensibly from Cestus Three."
KIRK,Arena,"One for the Enterprise to go there, and the other for myself and my tactical crew to beam down to the surface."
KIRK,Arena,It was a trap.
KIRK,Arena,"Getting the Enterprise to come to Cestus Three, getting us and our whole crew to come ashore."
KIRK,Arena,The reason is crystal clear.
KIRK,Arena,The Enterprise is the only protection in this section of the Federation.
KIRK,Arena,"Destroy the Enterprise, and everything is wide open."
KIRK,Arena,I have all the proof I need on Cestus Three.
KIRK,Arena,How can you explain a massacre like that?
KIRK,Arena,"No, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Arena,The threat is clear and immediate.
KIRK,Arena,Invasion.
KIRK,Arena,I intend to.
KIRK,Arena,"If we can keep them in the dark as to our strength, they'll never dare move against us."
KIRK,Arena,Captain to helmsman.
KIRK,Arena,Is the alien still making warp five?
KIRK,Arena,Initiate warp six.
KIRK,Arena,Overtake.
KIRK,Arena,"Phaser banks, lock on to the enemy vessel."
KIRK,Arena,Stand by for firing orders.
KIRK,Arena,"All hands, this is the Captain."
KIRK,Arena,We are going into battle.
KIRK,Arena,"All hands, battle stations."
KIRK,Arena,Red alert.
KIRK,Arena,"I repeat, red alert."
KIRK,Arena,This is no drill.
KIRK,Arena,This is no drill.
KIRK,Arena,Mister DePaul.
KIRK,Arena,Position.
KIRK,Arena,All scanners lock into computer banks.
KIRK,Arena,I want a complete record of this.
KIRK,Arena,"Mister Spock, what do we have on this general area?"
KIRK,Arena,Anything on intelligent life forms?
KIRK,Arena,"Mister Sulu, status, alien vessel."
KIRK,Arena,Warp factor seven.
KIRK,Arena,"Something the matter, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Arena,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Arena,I mean to catch them.
KIRK,Arena,They'll have to prove it.
KIRK,Arena,"Yes, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Arena,Of course.
KIRK,Arena,"Colony Cestus Three has been obliterated, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Arena,"If the aliens go unpunished, they'll be back, attacking other Federation installations."
KIRK,Arena,There's no time for that.
KIRK,Arena,It's a matter of policy.
KIRK,Arena,"Out here, we're the only policemen around."
KIRK,Arena,And a crime has been committed.
KIRK,Arena,Do I make myself clear?
KIRK,Arena,"I'm delighted, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Arena,"Report, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Arena,Warp factor eight.
KIRK,Arena,Captain to phaser banks.
KIRK,Arena,All components at battle ready.
KIRK,Arena,All banks primed.
KIRK,Arena,"Yes, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Arena,Good.
KIRK,Arena,Mister DePaul.
KIRK,Arena,Our position.
KIRK,Arena,Is it on the alien's course?
KIRK,Arena,By the alien ship?
KIRK,Arena,Any interference?
KIRK,Arena,Resistance?
KIRK,Arena,Mister Spock?
KIRK,Arena,"Mister Sulu, is the alien still heading away from that solar system?"
KIRK,Arena,"Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those scanning beams?"
KIRK,Arena,"Yes, what is it?"
KIRK,Arena,He may be turning to fight.
KIRK,Arena,Are you sure?
KIRK,Arena,Then we've got them.
KIRK,Arena,Go to Red Alert.
KIRK,Arena,Prepare to fire phaser banks.
KIRK,Arena,"Sensors, lock on."
KIRK,Arena,"Mister Sulu, continue closing."
KIRK,Arena,"Mister Spock, lock phasers into computer."
KIRK,Arena,Computers will control attack.
KIRK,Arena,From warp eight?
KIRK,Arena,Have you lost your mind?
KIRK,Arena,"Mister Scott, report."
KIRK,Arena,Phaser banks.
KIRK,Arena,Report.
KIRK,Arena,"Damage Control, report."
KIRK,Arena,Tractor beam?
KIRK,Arena,This is Kirk.
KIRK,Arena,I don't understand.
KIRK,Arena,What makes you think you can interfere with
KIRK,Arena,Just a minute
KIRK,Arena,"The Enterprise is dead in space, stopped cold during her pursuit of an alien raider by mysterious forces, and I have been somehow whisked off the bridge and placed on the surface of an asteroid, facing the Captain of the alien ship."
KIRK,Arena,"Weaponless, I face the creature the Metrons called a Gorn."
KIRK,Arena,"Large, reptilian."
KIRK,Arena,"Like most humans, I seem to have an instinctive revulsion to reptiles."
KIRK,Arena,"I must fight to remember that this is an intelligent, highly advanced individual, the Captain of a starship, like myself, undoubtedly a dangerously clever opponent."
KIRK,Arena,This is Captain James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise.
KIRK,Arena,Who ever finds this please get it to Starfleet Command.
KIRK,Arena,I'm engaged in personal combat with a creature apparently called a Gorn.
KIRK,Arena,He's immensely strong.
KIRK,Arena,Already he has withstood attacks from me that would have killed a human being.
KIRK,Arena,"Fortunately, though strong, he is not agile."
KIRK,Arena,"The agility and, I hope, the cleverness, is mine."
KIRK,Arena,"The Metrons, the creatures that sent us both here, said that the surface of the planet provides the raw material to construct weapons."
KIRK,Arena,There's very little here.
KIRK,Arena,"Scrub brush, rocks, an abundance of mineral deposits, but no weapons in the conventional sense."
KIRK,Arena,"Still, I need to find one."
KIRK,Arena,"Bare-handed against the Gorn, I have no chance."
KIRK,Arena,A large deposit of diamonds on the surface.
KIRK,Arena,Perhaps the hardest substance known in the universe.
KIRK,Arena,"Beautifully crystallized and pointed, but too small to be useful as a weapon."
KIRK,Arena,"An incredible fortune in stones yet I would trade them all for a hand phaser, or a good solid club."
KIRK,Arena,"Yet the Metrons said there would be weapons, if I could find them."
KIRK,Arena,Where?
KIRK,Arena,What kind?
KIRK,Arena,This may be my last entry.
KIRK,Arena,I am almost exhausted.
KIRK,Arena,Unless I find the weapon the Metron mentioned I have very little time left.
KIRK,Arena,"Native sulphur, diamonds."
KIRK,Arena,This place is a mineralogist's dream.
KIRK,Arena,Yet there is something about sulphur.
KIRK,Arena,Something very old.
KIRK,Arena,Something?
KIRK,Arena,If only I could remember.
KIRK,Arena,"Who is this, the Metron?"
KIRK,Arena,All right.
KIRK,Arena,What do you want?
KIRK,Arena,Like you were at Cestus Three?
KIRK,Arena,You butchered helpless human beings
KIRK,Arena,No.
KIRK,Arena,"No, I won't kill you."
KIRK,Arena,Maybe you thought you were protecting yourself when you attacked the outpost.
KIRK,Arena,"No, I won't kill him!"
KIRK,Arena,Do you hear?
KIRK,Arena,You'll have to get your entertainment someplace else!
KIRK,Arena,You're a Metron?
KIRK,Arena,You seem more like a boy.
KIRK,Arena,How?
KIRK,Arena,What happened to the Gorn?
KIRK,Arena,No.
KIRK,Arena,That won't be necessary.
KIRK,Arena,We can talk.
KIRK,Arena,Maybe reach an agreement.
KIRK,Arena,I don't know.
KIRK,Arena,I don't know.
KIRK,Arena,"All right, everybody."
KIRK,Arena,Back to your posts.
KIRK,Arena,Let's get out of here.
KIRK,Arena,Mister Sulu.
KIRK,Arena,"Don't try and figure it out, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Arena,Just plot a course for us back to Cestus Three.
KIRK,Arena,"We're a most promising species, Mister Spock, as predators go."
KIRK,Arena,Did you know that?
KIRK,Arena,I don't.
KIRK,Arena,Not anymore.
KIRK,Arena,"And maybe in a thousand years or so, we'll be able to prove it."
KIRK,Arena,"Never mind, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Arena,It doesn't make much sense to me either.
KIRK,Arena,"Take us back to where we're supposed to be, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Arena,Warp factor one.
MCCOY,Arena,I wonder if he brought his personal chef along with him to Cestus Three.
MCCOY,Arena,How well we both know that.
MCCOY,Arena,"Spock, isn't it enough the commodore is famous for his hospitality?"
MCCOY,Arena,"I, for one, could use a good non-reconstituted meal."
MCCOY,Arena,You bet your pointed ears I am.
MCCOY,Arena,"Ready whenever you are, Captain."
MCCOY,Arena,"Captain, over there."
MCCOY,Arena,"Careful, careful."
MCCOY,Arena,"Shock, radiation burns, internal injuries for certain."
MCCOY,Arena,"He's in a bad way, Captain."
MCCOY,Arena,He'll be dead in half an hour if we don't get him some decent care.
MCCOY,Arena,"What are you going to do, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,Arena,What about the Captain?
MCCOY,Arena,"Now, you're the one that's always talking about logic."
MCCOY,Arena,What about some logic now?
MCCOY,Arena,"Where's the Captain, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,Arena,"The ship, our engines, our weapons."
MCCOY,Arena,It's just inconceivable that we are immobilised.
MCCOY,Arena,We appeal to you in the name of civilisation.
MCCOY,Arena,Put a stop to this.
MCCOY,Arena,If there were only some way we could contact him.
MCCOY,Arena,So?
MCCOY,Arena,Can that be true?
MCCOY,Arena,Was Cestus Three an intrusion on their space?
MCCOY,Arena,Then we could be in the wrong.
MCCOY,Arena,The Gorn simply might have been trying to protect themselves.
MCCOY,Arena,"What is it, Spock?"
MCCOY,Arena,What's he doing?
MCCOY,Arena,What force?
MCCOY,Arena,Can he do it?
TRAVERS,Arena,"Travers, Jim."
TRAVERS,Arena,We're waiting.
TRAVERS,Arena,Be sure to bring along your tactical people.
TRAVERS,Arena,I've got an interesting problem for them.
SPOCK,Arena,Captain.
SPOCK,Arena,I wonder why he's insistent that our tactical aides come down.
SPOCK,Arena,"Perhaps, Captain, but nevertheless"
SPOCK,Arena,"Doctor, you are a sensualist."
SPOCK,Arena,"Those messages we got, Captain, the one directing us here yesterday."
SPOCK,Arena,"Captain, impulses that direction."
SPOCK,Arena,"Very weak, possibly a survivor."
SPOCK,Arena,"Getting another life reading, Captain."
SPOCK,Arena,Not survivors.
SPOCK,Arena,Not warm-blooded.
SPOCK,Arena,"Living creatures, but not human."
SPOCK,Arena,"Azimuth ninety three degrees, range one five seven zero yards."
SPOCK,Arena,"We're hopelessly outnumbered here, Captain."
SPOCK,Arena,It's those disruptors versus our hand phasers.
SPOCK,Arena,Sulu is an experienced combat officer.
SPOCK,Arena,Nor can they at us at the moment.
SPOCK,Arena,Not unless they moved their original position.
SPOCK,Arena,That intervening high ground.
SPOCK,Arena,About one hundred yards in that direction.
SPOCK,Arena,But after an attack as thorough as this one
SPOCK,Arena,"How is he, Doctor?"
SPOCK,Arena,They're moving.
SPOCK,Arena,I've got to get to the Captain.
SPOCK,Arena,"Locked on to the enemy, Captain."
SPOCK,Arena,They're moving toward the high ground.
SPOCK,Arena,(fizzing sound and smoke) They've locked on to my tricorder.
SPOCK,Arena,Very ingenious.
SPOCK,Arena,They fed back my own impulses and built up an overload.
SPOCK,Arena,Any word from the Enterprise?
SPOCK,Arena,Very clever.
SPOCK,Arena,As to the reason?
SPOCK,Arena,"You allude to invasion, Captain, yet positive proof"
SPOCK,Arena,"Not necessarily, sir."
SPOCK,Arena,Several possible explanations
SPOCK,Arena,"Very well, then."
SPOCK,Arena,"If that's the case, you must make certain that the alien vessel never reaches its home base."
SPOCK,Arena,"Virtually nothing, Captain."
SPOCK,Arena,No records of any explorations.
SPOCK,Arena,There are rumours of certain strange signals on subspace channels.
SPOCK,Arena,"However, none has ever been recorded."
SPOCK,Arena,"Nothing specific, Captain."
SPOCK,Arena,Unscientific rumours only.
SPOCK,Arena,More like space legends.
SPOCK,Arena,"A sustained warp seven speed will be dangerous, Captain."
SPOCK,Arena,"You mean to destroy the alien ship, Captain?"
SPOCK,Arena,I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient.
SPOCK,Arena,Destruction might be unnecessary.
SPOCK,Arena,"The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony, Jim."
SPOCK,Arena,I merely suggested that a regard for sentient life
SPOCK,Arena,"Very clear, Captain."
SPOCK,Arena,It would appear someone is curious about us.
SPOCK,Arena,"Computer lock ready, Captain."
SPOCK,Arena,All systems standing by.
SPOCK,Arena,"Same as the alien, Captain."
SPOCK,Arena,"All systems report normal, Captain."
SPOCK,Arena,No ascertainable damage.
SPOCK,Arena,"We're being held in place, Captain, apparently from that solar system."
SPOCK,Arena,We are being held.
SPOCK,Arena,"No, sir."
SPOCK,Arena,An unidentifiable power.
SPOCK,Arena,Have you tried overload?
SPOCK,Arena,How about bypassing the transformer banks?
SPOCK,Arena,Feed the impulse engines directly.
SPOCK,Arena,"Lieutenant Uhura, have sensors learned anything about the nature of the force which holds us here?"
SPOCK,Arena,No indication of its composition?
SPOCK,Arena,Gravimetric?
SPOCK,Arena,Magnetic?
SPOCK,Arena,Electronic?
SPOCK,Arena,"Leave channel one open, Lieutenant, just in case."
SPOCK,Arena,"I'm going to wait, Doctor."
SPOCK,Arena,There's little else I can do.
SPOCK,Arena,"If I could help him, I would."
SPOCK,Arena,I cannot.
SPOCK,Arena,"He's out there, Doctor."
SPOCK,Arena,"Out there somewhere in a thousand cubic parsecs of space, and there's absolutely nothing we can do to help him."
SPOCK,Arena,This is the U.S.S.
SPOCK,Arena,Enterprise calling the Metrons.
SPOCK,Arena,Our channels are open.
SPOCK,Arena,"Come in, please."
SPOCK,Arena,We urgently desire a conference.
SPOCK,Arena,Please answer.
SPOCK,Arena,"But it has happened, Doctor."
SPOCK,Arena,"Yes, indeed, Doctor, if only there were."
SPOCK,Arena,Notice the substance encrusting that rock.
SPOCK,Arena,Yes.
SPOCK,Arena,"Unless I'm mistaken, it's potassium nitrate."
SPOCK,Arena,"Perhaps nothing, Doctor."
SPOCK,Arena,(Kirk tastes the mineral and spits it out) Perhaps everything.
SPOCK,Arena,"It may well be possible, Doctor."
SPOCK,Arena,We know very little about that section of the galaxy.
SPOCK,Arena,Perhaps.
SPOCK,Arena,That is something best decided by diplomats.
SPOCK,Arena,Yes.
SPOCK,Arena,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Arena,Good.
SPOCK,Arena,Good.
SPOCK,Arena,"(Kirk cuts vines to length against a rock) He knows, Doctor."
SPOCK,Arena,He has reasoned it out.
SPOCK,Arena,Yes.
SPOCK,Arena,Yes.
SPOCK,Arena,"Recall your basic chemistry, Doctor."
SPOCK,Arena,Gunpowder.
SPOCK,Arena,"If he has the time, Doctor."
SPOCK,Arena,If he has the time.
SPOCK,Arena,"After you touched off your primitive cannon, Captain, we lost the picture the Metron was sending us."
SPOCK,Arena,Most of it.
SPOCK,Arena,I would be interested in knowing what finally happened.
SPOCK,Arena,I've frequently had my doubts.
SPOCK,Arena,"A thousand years, Captain?"
SULU,Arena,"What is it, Captain?"
SULU,Arena,"Captain, we're coming under attack."
SULU,Arena,Unidentified ship quartering in.
SULU,Arena,We can't beam you up.
SULU,Arena,I've just rigged up defensive screens.
SULU,Arena,"Firing phasers, Captain."
SULU,Arena,"The alien has screens up, too."
SULU,Arena,"Are you under attack, Captain?"
SULU,Arena,We could drop screens.
SULU,Arena,"Captain, are you all right?"
SULU,Arena,We returned fire with all phaser banks.
SULU,Arena,Negative against its deflector screen.
SULU,Arena,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,Arena,Arm photon torpedoes.
SULU,Arena,Stand by.
SULU,Arena,"No, sir."
SULU,Arena,Doesn't correspond with any configuration we're familiar with.
SULU,Arena,We can't get visual contact.
SULU,Arena,She's too far away.
SULU,Arena,"Photon torpedoes locked on, Captain."
SULU,Arena,"All banks fired, sir."
SULU,Arena,"Clear, Captain, but you"
SULU,Arena,"Yes, sir."
SULU,Arena,"Photon torpedoes negative, Captain."
SULU,Arena,I'm warping out of orbit.
SULU,Arena,"Captain, the alien's withdrawing."
SULU,Arena,"She's at extreme range, but our sensors indicate she just activated her transporters."
SULU,Arena,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,Arena,Our screens are down.
SULU,Arena,"We can beam you up now, sir."
SULU,Arena,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,Arena,"Sulu here, sir."
SULU,Arena,"Affirmative, sir."
SULU,Arena,"Affirmative, sir."
SULU,Arena,"They must be aware we're after them, sir."
SULU,Arena,They've gone to warp six also.
SULU,Arena,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,Arena,"Alien ship maintaining interval, Captain."
SULU,Arena,Now at warp seven.
SULU,Arena,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,Arena,Captain.
SULU,Arena,"Closing on target, sir."
SULU,Arena,"Yes, sir."
SULU,Arena,"We're closing, sir."
SULU,Arena,Captain!
SULU,Arena,The alien.
SULU,Arena,It's slowing down.
SULU,Arena,"Warp five, four, two."
SULU,Arena,"It's going sublight, sir."
SULU,Arena,Sir?
SULU,Arena,It's stopped dead in space.
SULU,Arena,"No, sir."
SULU,Arena,They're just dead out there.
SULU,Arena,"Yes, sir."
SULU,Arena,Unmoving.
SULU,Arena,Range is one eight one zero.
SULU,Arena,One seven six zero.
SULU,Arena,Range is one seven zero zero.
SULU,Arena,One six four zero.
SULU,Arena,Range is one five nine zero.
SULU,Arena,"One five five zero and closing, sir."
SULU,Arena,"(Suddenly, the ship decelerates, and everyone hangs on to something as the lights dim.)"
SULU,Arena,"Warp six, warp five, four, warp three, warp one."
SULU,Arena,"Sublight, Captain."
SULU,Arena,"We're stuck, Captain."
SULU,Arena,"It's impossible, but."
SULU,Arena,It's impossible.
SULU,Arena,He's gone.
SULU,Arena,Captain.
SULU,Arena,"It's impossible, but there's Sirius over there when it should be here."
SULU,Arena,And Canopus.
SULU,Arena,And Arcanis.
SULU,Arena,We're.
SULU,Arena,"All of a sudden, we're clear across the galaxy, five hundred parsecs from where we are I mean, were."
SULU,Arena,I mean
SULU,Arena,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,Arena,Warp factor one.
O'HERLIHY,Arena,"Captain, I see something."
DEPAUL,Arena,"Mister Sulu, photon torpedoes locked on."
DEPAUL,Arena,"Yes, sir."
DEPAUL,Arena,"Twenty two point three parsecs beyond latest chart limit, sir."
DEPAUL,Arena,"Yes, sir."
DEPAUL,Arena,"Two two seven nine pl, sir."
DEPAUL,Arena,Uncharted solar system at two four six six pm.
DEPAUL,Arena,"No, sir."
DEPAUL,Arena,He's headed away from it.
KELOWITZ,Arena,"They got Lang, sir."
KELOWITZ,Arena,"No, sir."
KELOWITZ,Arena,"If I were them, I'd go to the high ground on the right."
KELOWITZ,Arena,"I make it twelve hundred yards, azimuth eighty seven."
KELOWITZ,Arena,"It's pretty close for one of these little jewels, Captain."
MAN,Arena,Scanners reported a ship approaching.
MAN,Arena,We get them now and then.
MAN,Arena,They're all welcome to use our facilities.
MAN,Arena,You know that.
MAN,Arena,"They came in space normal speed, using our regular approach route, but they knocked out our phaser batteries with their first salvo."
MAN,Arena,From then on we were helpless.
MAN,Arena,We weren't expecting anything!
MAN,Arena,Why should we?
MAN,Arena,We didn't have anything anyone would want.
MAN,Arena,"They poured it on, like, like phasers, only worse, whatever they were using."
MAN,Arena,I tried to signal them.
MAN,Arena,We called up.
MAN,Arena,Tried to surrender.
MAN,Arena,We had women and children.
MAN,Arena,I told them that!
MAN,Arena,I begged them!
MAN,Arena,They wouldn't listen.
MAN,Arena,They didn't let up for a moment.
MAN,Arena,"They hit us a full day before you got there, Captain."
MAN,Arena,"No messages came from us, Captain."
MAN,Arena,Why did they do it?
MAN,Arena,Why?
MAN,Arena,Why did they do it?
MAN,Arena,There has to be a reason.
MAN,Arena,There has to be a reason!
SCOTT,Arena,"We'll either catch them or blow up, Captain."
SCOTT,Arena,They may be faster than we are.
SCOTT,Arena,"We're dead, Captain."
SCOTT,Arena,Locked up.
SCOTT,Arena,Frozen tight.
SCOTT,Arena,All propulsion systems read zero.
SCOTT,Arena,"They're all normal, sir."
SCOTT,Arena,"Atmosphere, heat, light."
SCOTT,Arena,No variance.
SCOTT,Arena,"I don't know, sir, but whatever it is, we canna move."
SCOTT,Arena,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,Arena,It does no good.
SCOTT,Arena,"I tried that, sir."
SCOTT,Arena,Nothing.
CREWMAN,Arena,Aft phaser to Bridge.
CREWMAN,Arena,Alert status.
CREWMAN,Arena,All weapons at operational ready.
CREWMAN,Arena,"We're all inoperative here, Captain."
CREWMAN,Arena,No power at all.
CREWMAN,Arena,No faulty circuits I can find.
CREWMAN,Arena,Just no power.
UHURA,Arena,"Captain, sensors report we're being scanned."
UHURA,Arena,"No, sir."
UHURA,Arena,It's from that solar system ahead.
UHURA,Arena,"No, sir, Just scanning beams."
UHURA,Arena,It's on an unusual wave length.
UHURA,Arena,"There's no hostility, sir."
UHURA,Arena,"They're not tractors or weapons of any sort, Just increasing in intensity."
UHURA,Arena,Steady.
UHURA,Arena,Regular.
UHURA,Arena,"It's growing stronger, sir."
UHURA,Arena,"No, sir."
UHURA,Arena,They report they definitely emanate from that solar system ahead.
UHURA,Arena,"Nothing, sir."
UHURA,Arena,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,Arena,Captain!
UHURA,Arena,Are you all right?
METRON,Arena,We are the Metrons.
METRON,Arena,You are one of two crafts which have come into our space on a mission of violence.
METRON,Arena,This is not permissible.
METRON,Arena,Yet we have analysed you and have learned that your violent tendencies are inherent.
METRON,Arena,So be it.
METRON,Arena,We will control them.
METRON,Arena,We will resolve your conflict in the way most suited to your limited mentalities.
METRON,Arena,Captain James Kirk.
METRON,Arena,We have prepared a planet with a suitable atmosphere.
METRON,Arena,"You will be taken there, as will the Captain of the Gorn ship which you have been pursuing."
METRON,Arena,There you will settle your dispute.
METRON,Arena,"You will be provided with a recording-translating device, in hopes that a chronicle of this contest will serve to dissuade others of your kind from entering our system, but you will not be permitted to communicate with your ship."
METRON,Arena,You will each be totally alone.
METRON,Arena,It is you who are interfering.
METRON,Arena,We are simply putting a stop to it.
METRON,Arena,"The place we have prepared for you contains sufficient elements for either of you to construct weapons lethal enough to destroy the other, which seems to be your intention."
METRON,Arena,The winner of the contest will be permitted to go his way unharmed.
METRON,Arena,"The loser, along with his ship, shall be destroyed in the interests of peace."
METRON,Arena,"The contest will be one of ingenuity against ingenuity, brute strength against brute strength."
METRON,Arena,The results will be final.
METRON,Arena,There will be no discussion.
METRON,Arena,It is done.
METRON,Arena,We are the Metrons.
METRON,Arena,Your Captain is losing his battle.
METRON,Arena,"We would suggest you make whatever memorial arrangements, if any, which are customary in your culture."
METRON,Arena,We believe you have very little time left.
METRON,Arena,Your violent intent and actions demonstrate that you are not civilised.
METRON,Arena,"However, we are not without compassion."
METRON,Arena,It is possible you may have feelings toward your Captain.
METRON,Arena,"So that you will be able to prepare yourself, we will allow you to see and hear what is now transpiring."
METRON,Arena,"Does my appearance surprise you, Captain?"
METRON,Arena,I am approximately fifteen hundred of your Earth years old.
METRON,Arena,"You surprise me, Captain."
METRON,Arena,"By sparing your helpless enemy who surely would have destroyed you, you demonstrated the advanced trait of mercy, something we hardly expected."
METRON,Arena,We feel there may be hope for your kind.
METRON,Arena,"Therefore, you will not be destroyed."
METRON,Arena,It would not be civilised.
METRON,Arena,"Very good, Captain."
METRON,Arena,There is hope for you.
METRON,Arena,"Perhaps in several thousand years, your people and mine shall meet to reach an agreement."
METRON,Arena,"You are still half savage, but there is hope."
METRON,Arena,We will contact you when we are ready.
GORN,Arena,(The bridge crew watch as enlightenment dawns and Kirk goes off in search of his other mineral discoveries.)
GORN,Arena,Earthling!
GORN,Arena,Captain!
GORN,Arena,"This is your opponent, Earthling."
GORN,Arena,I have heard every word you have said.
GORN,Arena,I'm weary of the chase.
GORN,Arena,Wait for me.
GORN,Arena,I shall be merciful and quick.
GORN,Arena,You were intruding!
GORN,Arena,You established an outpost in our space.
GORN,Arena,"We destroyed invaders, as I shall destroy you!"
GORN,Arena,"Captain, let us be reasonable."
GORN,Arena,You have lost.
GORN,Arena,Admit it to yourself.
GORN,Arena,Stop running.
GORN,Arena,I sent him back to his ship.
GORN,Arena,"If you like, I shall destroy him for you."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Well, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Photographic section, begin scanning."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Tie in to visual section 988-TG, computer bank 22."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"About four more orbits ought to do it, Mister Lesley."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,That'll wrap it up.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Lay in a course for Starbase 200.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Mister Spock!
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,What was that?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"I want facts, not poetry."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,That's impossible.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,What you're describing
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,All stations to immediate alert status.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Stand by.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,You just did a complete life survey five minutes ago.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,How are you just picking it up now?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Well, what is it, this object?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Its physical makeup?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,And its appearance coincided with this cosmic winking-out?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Explanation.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Speculation.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Could this being present any danger to the ship?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Lieutenant Uhura, notify Security to have an armed detachment of men ready to beam down with us."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Let's go.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Any word comes through from Starfleet Command, pipe it down immediately."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Communications, priority one."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Yes.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"You have a talent for understatement, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Without full crystal power, our orbit will begin to decay in ten hours."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Re-amplify immediately.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Any further magnetic disturbance?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Nothing?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Keep checking.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Repeat.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Invasion status.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"All hands, this is the Captain."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Battle stations.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"I repeat, battle stations."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,This is no drill.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Yes, Doctor, quickly."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I'll talk to him later.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Thank you.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Enterprise standing by, Commodore."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Thank you, sir."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I have considered all the alternatives.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,My best guess is it could be a prelude to invasion.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I see.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"You mean, we're the bait."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Thank you, sir."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,(transmission ends) Maintain alert status at all battle stations.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"From the top, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"First, the phenomenon came from the planet below."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Secondly, the danger is apparently real and imminent."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Yes.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Meanwhile, I'll talk to our unexpected guest."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Maybe he can provide some answers.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,You say this one man
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Thing destroyed your entire civilisation.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,How did you escape?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Before we picked you up, our ship sustained a number of incredible effects."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Is he the thing that attacked you?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"We don't have any other facts, any information."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,My only cause is the safety of my ship and the mission we're on.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,You'll beam down with me and I'll check your story out.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Spock, find anything?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"According to him, there's a creature of some sort down here, a humanoid."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Let's have it.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,The truth this time.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Can you identify that?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Lazarus!
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,You stay here.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"All personnel, security red."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Lazarus, what happened?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Let's get out of here.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Let's get back to the ship.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Any luck?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,If there's a shred of truth to what Lazarus said
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Hard to believe.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,But the rest of his story seems to fit.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,His wounds testify to an apparent confrontation with something.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Assuming there is a humanoid, a something, how does he do it?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"He has no weapons, no power."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,You tell me.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"That's why you brought me down here, isn't it."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Right.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Bones, I've got a lot of things to do."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Get to the point.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Where is he?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Lazarus, are you all right?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,No.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I have a ship's physician with a strange sense of humour.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Go.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Find something?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,On my way.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Lazarus, you're with me."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Bones, if I had time, I'd laugh."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,How is it the scanners didn't pick it up before?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Another riddle?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"First Doctor McCoy, then you?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,But it is there.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,A what?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,What do the crystals have to do with it?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,All they show us the point of radiation.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Out of the question.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Those crystals are the very heart of the power of my ship.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,How?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Now you tell me how.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"All I've heard is double-talk, lies, threats, accusations that don't hold water."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Now you tell me, how it presents a danger to my ship?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Don't threaten me, Lazarus."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Lieutenant, can you prepare an experimentation chamber in ten minutes?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"All dilithium crystals, full power."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Lieutenant, what is it?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,What's wrong?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Lieutenant?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Fact.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,You said you needed the crystals.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Fact.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"An hour after you said you must have them, they were missing."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Fact.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Two of my crewmen were attacked.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,How'd this beast get aboard my ship?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,No.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,He didn't transport up.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,A report would've been made.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Sit down.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,The crystals certainly aren't here.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,There's an unexplained radiation source on the planet.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Obviously some connection.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,We'll check it out.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Organise a search party immediately.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Mister Lazarus will beam down with us.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"You may not have reason to thank me, depending on what we find."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I believe the missing crystals aren't in your ship.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Mister Spock?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Why not?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,You had it spotted on the Enterprise.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I want every inch of this terrain checked.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Look for footprints, movement, anything."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Call out if you spot anything.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Don't be afraid to use your weapons.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,You saved my life down there.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I want to thank you.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I have some questions I want to ask you.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,It's necessary.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,This is a computer report of the evidence you gave at your first screening.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"It calls you a liar, Lazarus."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"For one thing, there's no planet at the location you said you came from."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,There never has been.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"If you want help from us, you'd better start telling the truth."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Try us.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I'll have the truth now.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,What are you saying?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"And this thing you search for is a time traveler, too?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Lazarus, you're hurt."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I know.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"I sympathise, but I've got four hundred and thirty other men to worry about."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Now where are those crystals?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Dismissed.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Sometimes pain can drive a man harder than pleasure.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"I'm sure you know that, Doctor."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"What have we got, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,A magnetic effect which produces a winking-out phenomenon.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"A mysterious, unidentified source of radiation on the planet."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Lazarus, a walking powder keg."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Your rip in the universe.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,A so-called murdering humanoid.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,But by using those instruments you were unable to identify the source of the radiation on the planet.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Are the instruments in order?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Then what you say leads obviously to one alternative.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,The source of radiation is not from our universe.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Outside?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Yes, that would explain a lot."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Another universe, perhaps in another dimension, occupying the same space at the same time."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,All right.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"What would happen if another universe, say a minus universe, came into contact with a positive universe such as ours?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Which is what we've been experiencing.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"The point where they come into contact, couldn't that be described as a hole?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Or what is outside to enter.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,The invasion that Commodore Barstow suspected.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"But a small scale invasion, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,What is your analysis of the mental state of Lazarus?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Yes, two men."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Different, but identical."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,And a hole in the universe.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"No, not a hole, A door."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Take a look at Lazarus.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"One minute he's at the point of death, the next he's alive, well, strong as a bull."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Which is physically impossible for one man.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,What's going on?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,This leaping from universe to universe.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,This wild talk about a murdering creature who destroys civilisations What's the purpose?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I don't follow you.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Do you know what you're saying?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Matter and antimatter have a tendency to cancel each other out.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,violently.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Like Lazarus.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Identical.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Like both Lazarus', only one is matter and the other antimatter."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,If they meet.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Of everything that exists, everywhere."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"All available personnel, on the double."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Spock, with me."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Report.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,He's probably beaming down with the crystals right now.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I'm going after him.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,You organise a security detail.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Follow me as soon as you can.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Energise.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Lazarus.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"No, him."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Not completely.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,This is a parallel universe?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Antimatter?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,And if identical particles meet
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,He has two more.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Exactly what did I pass through?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"This corridor, is it what caused the magnetic effect, the winking out phenomenon?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,And the universe is safe.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Surely Lazarus must realise what would happen if you should meet face to face outside the corridor.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"So you're the terrible thing, the murdering monster."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,The creature.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I understand.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,What do you want me to do?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,You can't hold him forever.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"If I destroy his ship, won't yours also be destroyed?"
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,And your door will be closed.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,You'll be trapped inside that corridor with him forever.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,At each other's throats throughout time.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I'm ready.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Stand back.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,I must destroy that ship completely.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,And what of Lazarus?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Activate phaser banks.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Stand by to fire.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Fire phasers.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"All right, Mister Lesley, let's get out of here."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Ahead warp factor one.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"Everything's all right, Mister Spock, for us."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,"There is, of course, no escape."
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,How would it be?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,Trapped forever with a raging madman at your throat until time itself came to a stop?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,For eternity.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,How would it be?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,For you and me.
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,But what of Lazarus?
KIRK,The Alternative Factor,What of Lazarus?
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Very typical, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Iron-silicon base, oxygen-hydrogen atmosphere, largely arid, no discernible life."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,No surprises.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Captain.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Incredible, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"What my instruments read is totally unbelievable, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Twice, for a split second each time, everything within range of our instruments seemed on the verge of winking out."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"I have given you the facts, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,The entire magnetic field in this solar system simply blinked.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"The planet below, the mass of which we're measuring, attained zero gravity."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Is non-existence.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Captain, scanners now report a life object on the planet surface below."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Inexplicable, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,This reading began at approximately the moment that the pulsation phenomenon began to subside.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,A living being.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Body temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Mass, electrical impulses, movement."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"It is apparently human, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,None.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Possible.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Very possible.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Scanners indicate situation normal.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Nothing.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Illogical.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"An effect of such proportions, unexplainable by any established physical laws that I'm aware of."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,I have been able to ascertain one fact.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Though the effect, whatever it was, was unquestioningly widespread, it was strongest here on the planet beneath us."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Third, a closer examination of the planet's surface would be in order."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"My job, sir?"
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Anything from our guest?
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Lieutenant Uhura communicated that information.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,I ordered re-confirmation on our sensors.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,They indicate no living creature on this planet.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"I suggest, Captain, that you've been lied to."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"I fail to comprehend your indignation, sir."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,I've simply made the logical deduction that you are a liar.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"I'm trying, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Captain, readings of the effect indicate it centred here on this planet, almost on this very spot."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,I can no more explain the occurrence of the second phenomenon than I can the first.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"That a single creature, a humanoid could be responsible for an effect of such magnitude?"
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Indeed.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Affirmative.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Captain, I only know for certain that the occurrence of the phenomenon coincides exactly with the moments that Lazarus has his alleged confrontations."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Request you come to the Bridge, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Something quite extraordinary.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Main screen on, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Source of radiation, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Because it is not there.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"What I mean, Captain, is that according to our usual scanning procedures, there is nothing there that could be causing that effect."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Affirmative.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,I confess I am somewhat at a loss for words.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"It may be described, though loosely and inaccurately, as a rip in our universe."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"A kind of physical warp, Captain, in which none of our established physical laws apply with any regularity."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"However, with the dilithium crystals, I was able to localise it."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,You refer to the humanoid?
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Why does he need the crystals?
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,For what reason?
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Unable to locate the source of radiation.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"It has simply disappeared, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"True, Captain, but more significant to me is the fact that our ship's instruments are specifically designed to locate and identify any object in our universe, be it energy or matter."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Correct.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Which would seem to be impossible.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Perfect working condition.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Nor in our universe, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,It came from outside.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"The possible existence of a parallel universe has been scientifically conceded, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Unquestionably a warp.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,A distortion of physical laws on an immense scale.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Indeed.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,I point out that a hole in the universe or in a simple container can either allow the contents to escape
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,There has been no evidence of a large-scale invasion.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Difficult, Captain."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"One moment, paranoid, the next, calm, mild, rational."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Almost as if he were two men.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Through which these two beings are somehow enabled to pass.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,The cut on his forehead.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"First he has it, then it's gone, then he has it again."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Quite right.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Unquestionably, there are two of him."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Jim, madness has no purpose or reason, but it may have a goal."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"He must be stopped, held."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Destroyed if necessary.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Two parallel universes project this.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"One positive, the other negative."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Or, more specifically, one matter, the other antimatter."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Precisely.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Under certain conditions, when two identical particles of matter and antimatter meet"
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Annihilation, Jim."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Total, complete, absolute annihilation."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Lazarus.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,A trick to get the crystals.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Spock to Bridge.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Lazarus.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,Take these crystals to the Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,What of Lazarus?
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"There is, of course, no escape for them, sir."
SPOCK,The Alternative Factor,"Captain, the universe is safe."
LESLEY,The Alternative Factor,"Aye, aye, Captain."
LESLEY,The Alternative Factor,Phaser banks activated.
LESLEY,The Alternative Factor,"Phasers standing by, sir."
LESLEY,The Alternative Factor,"Warp one, sir."
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,"Standard General Alert signal from Starfleet Command, Captain."
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,"Nothing yet, sir."
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,"Red Two message in one minute, Captain."
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,Starfleet Command.
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,"Code Factor one, sir."
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,Code Factor one.
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,"Message ready, Captain."
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,"Main screen, coming up."
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,"Aye aye, sir."
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,"Doctor McCoy asking to see you in sickbay, Captain."
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,Bridge calling the captain.
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,"Screen on, sir."
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,"Captain, Security reports Lazarus missing."
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,"Fire, Captain."
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,Engineering.
UHURA,The Alternative Factor,Situation critical.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,You came!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Thank the heavens.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,There's still time.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,It's not too late.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,We can still stop him.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"But I, but I, need, need your help."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"That's how I came to be down there, Captain, pursuing the devil's own spawn, a thing I've chased across the universe."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"He's humanoid outside, but inside, he's a hideous, murdering monster."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"I'll get him, Captain."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I swear it.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Not man!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Thing.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"To the last man, woman and child."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I was inspecting magnetic communications satellites.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"You believe me, don't you?"
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,That was he!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"He's death, anti-life, he lives to destroy."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Yes.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I give you my word.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I swear it.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Then you'll join me in my holy cause?
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Help me in visiting justice and vengeance upon him.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Captain, you yourself said there were no other explanations."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Why do you give credence to this man?
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,No!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"You've come back in, is it?"
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Well, don't stop."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Here I am.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Come at me again.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,We'll finish it!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Come!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Come!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,It'll do you no good.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I'll chase you to the very fires of hell!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I saw it again.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,The thing.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,It attacked me.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I told you it was a thing.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"All white, black and empty."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,A terrible emptiness.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,He'll kill us all if we don't kill him first!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Kill!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Kill!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Kill!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Kill!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Kill!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Yes.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,But impatient.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Have you decided to help me yet?
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Is something wrong?
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Yes!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,That's it!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,The dilithium crystals.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,With their power we could do it.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Yes.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"We've got him, Captain, we've got him."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"That's just it, that's the key."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,That's the way to trap him.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,That's the solution.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Captain, I beg of you."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"I plead, I demand."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Give me the crystals.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,You fool!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,There won't be any ship if we don't kill him.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,He'll destroy all of you.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"I warn you, Captain."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,You'll give me the crystals.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,No threat intended.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Captain, I'll have my vengeance."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"And fact, Captain."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I didn't take the crystals.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I'm not the one.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Find my enemy, find the beast, and you'll find the crystals."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,He did.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Isn't that enough?
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I tell you we're dealing with a creature capable of destroying worlds.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,For the same reason that I do.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Listen to me.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,He's humanoid.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Why, he he can pilot a spaceship."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,He can compute formulas to destroy races.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,He can steal an energy source for his vehicle so he can escape from me.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Are you deaf as well as blind?
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Thank you, Captain."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"What do you believe now, Captain?"
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Captain, look out!"
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"The thing, the thing."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"The rock, I"
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Aches.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Why shouldn't I?
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Go ahead.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,It's all right.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,All right.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"I distorted a fact in the interest of self-preservation, for my holy cause."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"I needed help, not censure."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Freedom, not captivity for being a madman."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I was afraid that's what you'd call me if I told you the truth.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"My planet, my Earth, or what's left of it, is down there beneath us."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,My spaceship is more than just that.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"It's a time chamber, a time-ship, and I. I am a time traveller."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Oh, yes."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"He's fled me across all the years, all the empty years to a dead future on a murdered planet he destroyed."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Help me!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Give me the tools I need to kill him!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,The crystals!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Don't let him get away!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Don't let him get away.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"I told you, he's got them."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,He took them.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,The thing!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,The thing!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Oh, I didn't know."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I'll get you now.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I have a threshold.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Run, run."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I'll get you now.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"It's done, it's done!"
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Finished, finished."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,It's done.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,It's done.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"It's done, it's done."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Done.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,No!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Don't!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Not you!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,No!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Welcome, Captain."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I wasn't expecting you.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Yes, him."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,You understand.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Of course.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Here, yes."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,The end of everything.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Civilisation, existence, all gone."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"I tried to stop him, Captain."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,That's why I took your dilithium crystals.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"That's very bad, Captain."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,If he comes through at a time of his own choosing.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"But I think if we hurry and you will help me, he can yet still be stopped."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,There's little time left.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,He meant to come through.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"When you accidentally passed through, it drained his crystals."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,It'll take him about ten minutes to re-energise with the equipment aboard his ship.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,That should give us enough time.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"That's hard to explain, Captain."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I call it an alternative warp.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,It's sort of a negative magnetic corridor where the two parallel universes meet.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,It's sort of a safety valve.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,It keeps eternity from blowing up.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Precisely, Captain, but not because of its existence."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Because, because my foe entered."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"The corridor is like a prison, with explosives at the door."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Open the door, and the explosives might go off."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Stay inside
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Both universes, Captain."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Yours and mine.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Of course he knows, Captain, but he's mad."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,You heard him.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,He's lost his mind.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"When our people found a way to slip through the warp and prove another universe, an identical one, existed, it was too much for him."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,He could not live knowing that I lived.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,He became obsessed with the idea of destroying me.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"The fact that it meant his own destruction, and everything else, meant nothing to him."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Yes, Captain."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Or he is.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"It depends on your point of view, doesn't it?"
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"It's ready, Captain."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"If we can force him into the corridor while I'm waiting for him, we can put an end to this."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,But if he comes through at a time of his own choosing and breaks into this universe to find me
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Find him.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Force him through his threshold, while I'm waiting for him, into the corridor, and I'll hold him there."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Can't I, Captain?"
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,You destroy his ship.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,It will.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"Yes, and so will his."
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Is it such a large price to pay for the safety of two universes?
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,Send him to me.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I'll be waiting.
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,No!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,No!
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,"No, I'm not ready!"
LAZARUS,The Alternative Factor,I'm not ready!
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,"(A woman in a blue uniform) Report on the dilithium crystals, Captain."
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,"Whatever that phenomenon was, it drained almost all of our crystals completely."
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,It could mean trouble.
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,"Aye aye, sir."
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,Hi.
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,Coffee?
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,I know what you mean.
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,Re-amplification finished on the dilithium crystals?
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,Masters here.
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,"I'll check, sir."
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,Captain.
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,"The chamber will be ready in ten minutes, sir."
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,My assistant and I will
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,Captain!
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,Captain!
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,The energiser has shorted.
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,Get out of here.
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,Sound the alarm.
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,"No, I've got to stay"
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,Engineering calling Bridge.
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,Fire!
MASTERS,The Alternative Factor,Fire in the energising circuit.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"McCoy, Captain."
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,About our patient.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,He'll make it.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"He'll be stiff and sore for a while, but he'll be all right."
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"I don't know, Jim."
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"Maybe I'm imagining things, and maybe I'm not."
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,You tell me.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"Well, as you know, we both brought Lazarus in here and I treated a deep abrasion on his forehead, right?"
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"Then I bandaged it, I stepped into this room for just a moment"
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"Well, say he's got the constitution of a dinosaur, recuperative powers ditto."
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"As we both know, I'm a bright young medic with a miraculous touch."
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"Why then, when I returned, there wasn't a trace of that wound on his forehead."
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,Not even a bruise.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,It was like he had never been injured.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"I don't know, Jim."
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,This is a big ship.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,I'm just a country doctor.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"This is no joke, Jim."
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,I know what I saw.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,He's coming out of it now.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,It's all right.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,You're on board the Enterprise.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,How's your head?
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"Not now, Jim."
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"He's got to get some rest, Jim."
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,And would you get that muscleman out of my Sickbay.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,(gestures at the security guard)
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,He's in a lot of pain.
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,"Well, don't worry, he's not going anywhere."
MCCOY,The Alternative Factor,Not this time.
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,You're aware of the effect an hour ago?
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,You may not be aware of its scope.
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,It occurred in every quadrant of the galaxy and far beyond.
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,"Complete disruption of normal magnetic and gravimetric fields, timewarp distortion, possible radiation variations."
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,And all of them centring on the general area which you are now patrolling.
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,"The question is, are these natural phenomena or are they mechanically created, and if they are, by whom?"
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,For what purpose?
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,"Your guess, Captain."
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,Exactly our consensus.
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,I'm giving you the job of finding out specifically.
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,Negative.
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,I'm evacuating all Starfleet units and personnel within a hundred parsecs of your position.
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,"It's going to be tough on you and the Enterprise, but that's the job you've drawn."
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,You're on your own.
BARSTOW,The Alternative Factor,Good luck.
ENGINEER,The Alternative Factor,Hi.
ENGINEER,The Alternative Factor,"Is that an order, Lieutenant?"
ENGINEER,The Alternative Factor,Yes.
ENGINEER,The Alternative Factor,Ready and waiting.
ENGINEER,The Alternative Factor,"Lieutenant Masters, Captain's calling."
ENGINEER,The Alternative Factor,Come on.
ENGINEER,The Alternative Factor,"You, too, Lieutenant."
ENGINEER,The Alternative Factor,We've got to get out of here.
ENGINEER,The Alternative Factor,The whole thing might blow!
ENGINEER,The Alternative Factor,"Under control, sir, but it couldn't have started by itself."
CHIEF,The Alternative Factor,"Sir, you shouldn't be in here."

and operational readiness to the First Officer."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Kirk out.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Lieutenant
Uhura, contact Starfleet Control."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I want them alerted to the position
of that black star that's in the area of Starbase 9."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Orbit where?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Screen on.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Give us some altitude, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Put it on audio.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Manned Moon shot?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",That was in the late 1960s.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Mister Sulu, can you gain altitude faster?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I
want to outdistance him."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Scotty, activate tractor beam."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Lock onto that aircraft and hold
it out there."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Try and beam that pilot aboard.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Take over, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Welcome aboard the Enterprise.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",That's right.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",You can step off the transporter
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Relax, Captain, you're among friends."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I'm Captain James T. Kirk.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","All in good time, Captain."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Meanwhile, let me apologise for
bringing you aboard the ship so abruptly, but it couldn't be helped."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I didn't know that your craft couldn't stand up to our tractor beam.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We'll tell you what we decide to tell you in a few moments.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","In
the meantime, relax."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",You're our guest.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I have a feeling you'll find it
interesting."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","What is it, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Affirmative.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We have the pilot aboard.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I'll be right up.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Kirk
out."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Follow me.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Morning.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",(drags Christopher along) Captain.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Crewman.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Bridge.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",There are only twelve like it in the fleet.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We're a combined service, Captain."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Our authority is the United
Earth Space Probe Agency."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",This is very difficult to explain.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We're from your future.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","A time
warp placed us here."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",It was an accident.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Captain Christopher, this is my First Officer, Lieutenant
Commander Spock."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Feel free to look around, Captain."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Don't touch anything, but I
think you'll find it interesting."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Very well, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Anything else on your mind?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What about him?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Your logic can be most annoying.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",That flight suit must be uncomfortable.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","(to Spock) Why don't you
have the quartermaster issue him something more suitable?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Then I want
to meet you and him in my quarters."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Computer on.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Record.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Come.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Captain's log, supplemental."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Engineering Officer Scott informs
warp engines damaged, but can be made operational and reenergised."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Computer, you will not address me in that manner."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Compute.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Mister Spock, I ordered this computer and its interlinking
systems repaired."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't get so affectionate.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I'm afraid you'll have to.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We can't send you back.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",It's not the transporter.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",It's you.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","You know what the future
looks like."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","If anybody else finds out, they could change the course of
it, destroy it."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I'd report, If I could."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We can't take the risk.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I'm sorry.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","What is it, Scotty?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","But what, Scotty?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Yes, Scotty."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Carry on.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Maintenance note.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","My recording computer has a serious
malfunction."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Recommend it either be corrected or scrapped.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Compute.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Yes, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Report to my quarters.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I'll contact Captain
Christopher."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Captain Christopher.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Captain Christopher?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Security, this is the
Captain."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",He tried to escape.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I know how he feels, but I can't send him
back with what he knows."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Yes.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",But we're not in that position yet.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","And if we do get back to where we belong, then he won't belong."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We're roughly about the same age, but in our society he'd be useless."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Archaic.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Now you're sounding like Spock.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Could he be retrained to forget his family?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",His children?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",You all right?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","You said you had some additional information, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Well, that's it, isn't it?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We'll have to find some way of
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","That means those search parties will be crawling all over that
wreckage."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","If I remember my history, these things were being dismissed as
weather balloons, sun dogs, explainable things."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",At least publicly.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","What about our problem, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Any ideas on how to get us
back to our own time?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We're going to have to go back and get those reports and photos.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","If the Captain feels duty bound to report what he saw, there won't be
any evidence to support him."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Perhaps.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","No, Captain."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Thank you, but if anything should go wrong, you
might get hurt."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We couldn't risk that.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Neither could you or your son.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Primitive computer.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I've seen them demonstrated in museums.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I don't intend to start it.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What was what?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Yes, I'm all right, but as you can see, we
have another problem."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Your surprise package is an Air Police
sergeant from the base."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I want you to keep him in the
transporter room."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","No sense in letting him see more of the ship than is
necessary."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Kirk out.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","(returns to the magnetic tapes)
What was the chronometer reading when we first sighted Christopher's
jet?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Put it at the end of these tapes, will you?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Get them all.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We'll try the darkroom.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Yes, that's it."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",That's all of them.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Signal Mister Spock that
we're almost ready to beam up."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I'll make a check of the files just in
case."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What other one?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","No, no, no."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Just me.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Besides, could anyone get out of here
without your seeing them?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Believe me, Colonel, you wouldn't believe me."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I popped in out of thin air.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","No, Colonel."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I know it's no game.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","For the fourth time, my name is James T. Kirk."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Colonel, would you mind being careful with that?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Of some kind.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","If you don't stop being careless with that, you'll have one."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","A
big one."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",This little thing?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Just something I slipped on.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Did I sabotage something?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Believe me, Colonel, nothing at all."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",That's what would have happened if you hadn't interfered.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","All right, Colonel."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","The truth is, I'm a little green man from
Alpha Centauri."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",A beautiful place.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",You ought to see it.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",That ought to be just about right.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Yes, I do."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What's he doing here?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I see.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",No harm done.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Mister Sulu, did you check out those tapes?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",All they have is a mystery and no answers.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Mister Sulu, signal
the Transporter Chief."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Four to beam up.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Don't be a fool.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",You know what's at stake.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",You can't explain your presence on the base.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","You'll go home, Christopher but you'll do it our way."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Four to beam up, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","You won't have anything to remember, because it never would have
happened."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Helm control?
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Well, gentlemen, we all have to take a chance."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Especially if one
is all you have."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Assume your stations.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Ahead warp factor three, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Take a good look around, Captain."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","You made it here ahead of all
of them."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Get your gear.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Report to the transporter room.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","And Captain
Christopher, you only have about fifteen years, so you'd better hurry."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Now, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","(the ship lurches sideways) More power, Mister
Sulu."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Do you have the chronometer reading and the co-ordinates to
return Captain Christopher and the guard?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Bridge to transporter room.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Captain Christopher.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We're coming up on Earth fast, Captain."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Are
you ready?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Our pleasure, Captain."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Bridge out.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Bridge to transporter room.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Prepare to energise.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Energise.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Bridge to transporter room, prepare to energise."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Energise.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","What's our reading, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Bridge to engineering.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Begin full braking power.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","No choice, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Never mind, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Mister Scott is still with us.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Open a channel, Uhura."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Starfleet Control, this is the Enterprise."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Captain Kirk speaking.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Starfleet Control, repeating message."
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",The Enterprise is home.
KIRK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Kirk out.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Except for secondary systems, everything is out, sir."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We're on
impulse power only."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","If Mister Scott is still with us, auxiliaries should be on
momentarily."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","(Uhura is just stirring on the floor) Are you all right,
Lieutenant?"
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Mister Scott is still with us.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Captain?
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Casualty reports indicate only minor injuries.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Engineering reports warp engines
non-operational."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Mister Scott overrode the automatic helm setting and
is holding us in orbit on impulse power."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Earth, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We were on a general course in this direction
when we were pulled in by the star."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Apparently the breakaway threw us
on in the same direction."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We are too low in the atmosphere to retain this orbit, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Engineering reports we have sufficient impulse power to achieve escape
velocity."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Apparently, Captain, so are we."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Whiplash propelled us into a time warp, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Backward.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Exact
chronometer readings in a few moments."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Verified.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Scanners report some type of craft approaching from
below us."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Under cloud cover and closing.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Positive identification, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Aircraft is an interceptor,
equipped with missiles, possibly armed with nuclear warheads."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","If he
hits us with one, he might damage us severely, perhaps beyond our
capacity to repair under current circumstances."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Captain, this type of aircraft might be too fragile to take our
tractor beam."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Aircraft is breaking up, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Bridge to Captain Kirk.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","The aircraft has completely broken up, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Shall we
turn off the tractor beam?"
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Neither have I.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Captain.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We've achieved a stable orbit out of Earth's atmosphere.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Our
deflectors are operative, enough to prevent our being picked up again
as a UFO."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",And Mister Scott wishes to speak to you about the engines.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Captain Christopher.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We cannot return him to Earth, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","He already knows too
much about us and is learning more."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I do not specifically refer to
Captain Christopher, but suppose an unscrupulous man were to gain
certain knowledge of man's future?"
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Such a man could manipulate key industries, stocks, and even nations."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","and in so doing, change what must be."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","And if it is changed, Captain,
you and I and all that we know might not even exist."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Yes, sir."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I have investigated it, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","To correct the fault will
require an overhaul of the entire computer system and a minimum of
three weeks at a
Starbase."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We put in at Cygnet Fourteen for general repair and maintenance.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Cygnet Fourteen is a planet dominated by women.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","They seemed to feel the
ship's computer system lacked a personality."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",They gave it one.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Female,
of course."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I have run a computer check on all historical tapes.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","They show
no record of any relevant contribution by John Christopher."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Bridge to Captain Kirk.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Have some new information regarding Captain Christopher.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Important I see you both immediately.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Yes, sir."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Bridge out.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Crude methods, but effective."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I made an error in my computations.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I find that we must return Captain Christopher to Earth after
all."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Poor choice of words on my part.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I neglected, in my initial
run-through, to correlate the possible contributions by offspring."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I
find, after running a crosscheck on that factor, that your son Colonel
Shaun Geoffrey Christopher headed, or will head, the first successful
Earth-Saturn probe, which is a rather significant"
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",The doctor is correct.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Unless we return Captain Christopher to
Earth, There will be no Colonel Shaun Geoffrey Christopher to go to
Saturn."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Acknowledging that we must return Captain
Christopher, there are several problems, prime of which is the
explanation of his return."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We tracked his plane wreckage down after our tractor beam crushed it.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",It crashed in an open section of southern Nebraska.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",And Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Captain, our tractor beam caught and crushed an Air Force plane."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","It'll be impossible to explain this as anything other than a genuine
UFO."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Possibly alien, definitely destructive."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",A theory.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",A reverse application of what happened to us.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Logically, it could work."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Also, logically, there are a hundred
variables, any one of which could put us in a worse position than we're
in now."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Not at all.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","You'll simply be one of the thousands who thought he
saw a UFO."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Fifteen minutes, twenty eight seconds."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","It is a fact, Doctor, that prowling by stealth is more
time-consuming than a direct approach."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",In our case
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I am.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","You may be correct, Doctor."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Open communicator channel.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Beam up immediately.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We'll know in a moment, Doctor."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Spock here.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Are you all right, Captain?"
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I don't believe there'll be trouble in that respect, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Our guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Your decision to beam up was quite correct,
Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Spock here.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Do so now, engineer."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We'll need all power to test our theory.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",(examining a roll of film) Poor photography.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I am aware of that, Doctor."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",This is the first officer.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Captain
Christopher to the briefing room."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Quite logical, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Can you give us the co-ordinates to beam
down a landing party near those interrogation rooms?"
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I can't do that, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Mister Sulu, you and Captain Christopher will beam down with me."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",The captain will provide the co-ordinates for the transporter chief.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","One for you, one for me."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Set them on heavy stun force.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","In fact, I do."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",But only to a certain point.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Energise.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","(It's Spock, who neck-pinches the hapless airman."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Kirk punches Lt.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Colonel Fellini's lights out.)
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Don't you find that painful, Captain?"
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","He knew the exact beam down co-ordinates for this section of the
base."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",It was necessary to bring him along.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I suspected he might not wish to return with us.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Mister Scott and I both agree that the only
possible solution is the slingshot effect, like the one that put us
here."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","My computations indicate that if we fly toward the sun, seek out
its magnetic attraction, then pull away at full power, the whiplash
will propel us into another time warp."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Logically, as we move faster and faster toward the sun, we'll
begin to move backward in time."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We'll actually go back beyond
yesterday,
beyond the point when we first appeared in the sky."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Then, breaking free
will shoot us forward in time, and we'll transport you back before any
of this happened."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased
greatly."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","From here, we'll move even faster."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","And Captain, notice the
chronometers."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",They've started backward.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Minute by minute, the speed of
time passage will now increase."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Approaching breakaway point.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",On the countdown.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We've broken free and heading back.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Chronometers moving forward again, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Computed.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Twenty minutes, sir."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",It'll be close.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Ten minutes.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two,
one."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Approaching second beaming, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Now.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Approaching our century, Captain."
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Braking should begin now.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Fifty years to go.
SPOCK,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Forty, thirty."
UHURA,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Captain, normal Starfleet channel has nothing but static."
UHURA,"Tomorrow

FLIGHT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Can you see it?
FLIGHT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What is it?
FLIGHT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Bluejay 4.
FLIGHT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Come in.
FLIGHT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We've lost the image.
FLIGHT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We don't track mirages.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I have him on my screen.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Following.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Blackjack, this is Bluejay 4."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","UFO is
picking up speed and climbing."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I'm going in closer.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I can see it now.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Whatever this is, it's big."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Two
cylindrical projections on top, one below."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Purpose undetermined.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I won't be here.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",The UFO's climbing away fast.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Acknowledged.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Closing on target.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",You speak English.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Captain John Christopher, United States Air Force."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Serial
number 4857932."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What's going on here?
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Where am I?
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What happened?
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","You
people, who are you?"
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Don't give me any double-talk.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Just tell me who you are.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",A woman?
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Must have taken quite a lot to build a ship like this.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I see.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Did the Navy
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",United Earth?
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",You seem to have a lot of them.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","However, I can't deny the
fact that you're here."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",With this ship.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I never have believed in little green
men."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Interesting is a word and a half for it, Captain."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I take it that a lady computer is not routine.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Well, you people certainly have interesting problems."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I'd
love to stay around to see how your girlfriend works out, but"
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Can't?
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Spock here told me that your transporter can beam
down an object even from an orbit this high."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Well then my disappearance would change something, too."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Look, Captain, I don't buy all your time accident story."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",The experts can figure out who you are and what you are.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","It's my duty
to report what I've seen."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Well, what would you do?"
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I don't want to know about risks.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I have a wife, two
children."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What about them?
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Too bad, Captain."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Maybe I can't go home, but neither can
you."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",You're as much a prisoner in time as I am.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",All right.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Nice and easy.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Now I'm
going to step into that thing, and you're going to transport me back to
Earth."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",The answer to that is no.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I see physical training is required in your service,
too."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What does he mean by that?
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Why?
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",You said I made no relative contribution.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Wait a minute.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I don't have a son.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",A boy.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I'm going to have a son.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","When I made visual contact, I turned on my wing cameras."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I
got close enough to take some pretty clear pictures of you."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Air Defence
Command will be processing that film fast."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","And ADC Control was probably
recording my radio transmissions."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",That makes me out to be either a liar or a fool.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Captain, I know that base."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I was stationed there a year
ago."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I'd like to
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Well, I'd like to help."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I could sketch a layout of the
place for you."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Show you where the record section and the photo lab are.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","He's probably being held in security
section."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Even if they've notified the authorities, it'll take a little
time for someone to get there."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Yes, but you're not going to get them unless you take me
with you."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Something's already gone wrong.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Of course, you could beam
down anywhere inside that base, but it would take time to find him."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","You don't trust me, Spock."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",They know you've been here.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",(holding the security guard's gun) Uh-uh.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Not me.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",You bet I do.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",My family.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",A son that isn't born yet.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","You
don't have to return me now, Captain."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Spock, come out of there."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I told you it's my duty to report everything I've seen.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",That's explanation enough.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Spock!
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Over my dead body.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Slingshot effects are fine for you people.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","How do you
propose to return the Sergeant and me?"
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What if you can't pull free of the sun?
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I never thought I'd make it into space.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I was in line to
be chosen for the space
programme but I didn't qualify."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",This is Christopher.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Everything A-OK.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Captain, thanks for the look ahead."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Blackjack, this is Bluejay Four."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I could have sworn there
was some kind of ship, but nothing could have moved that fast."
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Mark it down as another UFO.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Bluejay Four returning to base.
CHRISTOPHER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Out.
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Tractor beam on, sir."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We have the target.
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Engine room to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Progress report, sir."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Everything's jury-rigged, but we're coming
along with the repairs."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We could re-energise in about four hours, but"
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Well sir, as I say, the engines are being
repaired, but we've no place to go in this time."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","If you, if you see
what I mean?"
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Sir?
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Engine room to Mister Spock.
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We've completed re-energising the warp engines, sir."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We can
re-fire them anytime."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Engine room out.
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Oh, we'll do that all right, Captain."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We'll not be getting so
close that my engines couldn't pull us out."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","What I am worried about,
sir, that we may not have much control when we're thrown forward again."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Braking control, sir."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","If I can't stop us soon enough, we may
overshoot our time, and if I stop the engines suddenly the strain may
tear us apart."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Anyway we do it, it's a mighty rough ride."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Pulling away from the sun weakened them,
sir."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",They may blow apart if I reverse.
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Engine room to Bridge.
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Engines are on full
reverse."
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",They're buckling!
SCOTT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Bridge!
KYLE,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Scanning area, sir."
KYLE,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","One emergency signal, sir."
KYLE,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Are you hungry?
KYLE,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What would you like?
CREWWOMAN,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Good morning, Captain."
COMPUTER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","(in a low, breathy voice) Recording."
COMPUTER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Computed and recorded, dear."
COMPUTER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Computed, dear."
COMPUTER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Recommendation for his disposition, dear?"
COMPUTER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",(petulant) Computed.
COMPUTER,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Record ship arrival, dear."
CHIEF,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Security Chief here, sir."
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Well, Jim, with the exception of a slight
bruise or two, our Captain is as healthy as a proverbial horse."
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","He'll
be coming out of it in a minute or two."
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Jim, what if we can't go back?"
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","What do we do, sit up here and
wait for our supplies to run out, our power to die?"
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","It has to
eventually, you know."
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We certainly can't go back to Earth.
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","It would be
worse than the Captain being returned."
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","There are four hundred and
thirty of us, and that means four hundred and thirty chances of
altering the future."
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I'm glad to hear it.
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Maybe he could be retrained, reeducated."
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","If you're going to get nasty, I'm going to leave."
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","It's just a joke, Captain."
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Oh?
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",This could be an historic occasion.
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",You mean yet.
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",How long have they been down there now?
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Well, shouldn't they be coming up?"
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Shouldn't you be working on your time warp calculations, Mister
Spock?"
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",It's been too long.
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Jim should have at least
signaled by now."
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Only one signal.
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What happened?
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Blast your theories and observations, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","What about
Jim?"
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","He's down there alone, probably under arrest."
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","He doesn't have a
communicator, and we can't locate him or beam him back aboard without
one."
MCCOY,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",If something went wrong
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Hold it.
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Get your hands up.
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Now, one at a time, hand me those
belts."
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",And the bag.
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What was that?
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",That noise.
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",That noise.
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",It's coming from one of these things.
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Stay right where you are.
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Do they do that all the time?
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Uh-huh.
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Maybe some chicken soup.
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","(Kyle puts a card in the slot and the hatch slides up to reveal a bowl
on a tray."
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",The Sergeant dips his finger in to taste it.)
SERGEANT,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",It is.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Photo lab.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",All right.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Where's the other one?
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Your partner.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I saw you looking that was and I saw somebody
move in there."
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",No.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Nobody should have been able to.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Now, look, Mister."
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","You and I had better
start communicating."
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I want to know how you got in here.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","That's a
simple question."
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Give me a simple answer.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Nobody saw you.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","You got all
the way inside without tripping any alarm."
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",How did you do it?
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Don't try to be funny.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",How did you get in?
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",You seem to think this is some kind of a game.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",All right.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",What did you say your name was?
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","And how did you get inside a top security installation, James
T. Kirk?"
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","That worries you a little bit, huh?"
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","What is that, a radio?"
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Transmitter of some kind?
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","You can be more specific than that, Kirk."
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","I don't like
mysteries."
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I'll have it disassembled and examined.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","We are not dummies,
mister."
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We know how to find out things we want to know.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","(tosses it to
the guard standing nearby) What is that?"
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Is that a uniform of some
kind?"
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Kirk, maybe you don't realise how serious this is."
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Sabotage of
a government installation"
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",No.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",We stopped you in time.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","But what would you have done if we
hadn't found you?"
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Is that what you're here for?
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Nothing at all?
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","All right, Kirk."
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Maybe this will make you laugh.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Sabotage,
espionage, unauthorised entry, burglary."
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",How are those for starters?
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",And I can think up lots more if you don't start talking.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",I am going to lock you up for two hundred years.
FELLINI,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","See what that is, airman."
GUARD,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Just a minute, sir."
GUARD,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Hold it.
STARFLEET,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday",Starfleet Control calling Enterprise.
STARFLEET,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Come in,
Enterprise."
STARFLEET,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Enterprise, this is Starfleet Control."
STARFLEET,"Tomorrow
is Yesterday","Come in, please."
SULU,The Return of The Archons,"O'Neil, we've got to keep going."
SULU,The Return of The Archons,"Come on, get up."
SULU,The Return of The Archons,The Captain gave us an order.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,We've got to find some clue.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,Scouting party to Enterprise.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,Come in.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,"Captain, beam us up quick."
SULU,The Return of The Archons,Emergency.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,"Mister O'Neil, stand tight."
SULU,The Return of The Archons,They'll beam us up any minute.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,O'Neil!
SULU,The Return of The Archons,What?
SULU,The Return of The Archons,Who?
SULU,The Return of The Archons,You.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,You're not of the Body.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,"You, you did it."
SULU,The Return of The Archons,They knew we were Archons.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,"These are the clothes they wear, not these."
SULU,The Return of The Archons,Landru.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,Landru.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,They're wonderful.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,"They're the sweetest, friendliest people in the universe."
SULU,The Return of The Archons,"It's paradise, my friend."
SULU,The Return of The Archons,Paradise.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,Paradise.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,Paradise.
SULU,The Return of The Archons,Relieving you.
O'NEIL,The Return of The Archons,It's no use.
O'NEIL,The Return of The Archons,They're everywhere.
O'NEIL,The Return of The Archons,"It's no use, Mister Sulu."
O'NEIL,The Return of The Archons,"Look, there's one of them."
O'NEIL,The Return of The Archons,There's another one.
O'NEIL,The Return of The Archons,We've got to make a run for it.
O'NEIL,The Return of The Archons,We can't just stand here.
O'NEIL,The Return of The Archons,"Run, I tell you."
O'NEIL,The Return of The Archons,We've got to get out of here.
O'NEIL,The Return of The Archons,You know what they're capable of.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"What is it, Mister Sulu?"
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Transporter room, lock onto Sulu and O'Neil."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Beam up immediately.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Sulu, what is it?"
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Where's Lieutenant O'Neil?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Lieutenant O'Neil.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Where is he?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Sulu, take it easy."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Sit down.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,(McCoy enters) What happened?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Lieutenant O'Neil.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Where is he?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Materialisation completed.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Like Sulu.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,If everybody on this planet is like him.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Let's go.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Joy to you.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Yes.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"This Festival, it starts at six o'clock?"
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Let's get out of here.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Yes, that's right."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We're from the valley.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Yes.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We heard that you might have rooms for us.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"We have no plans to attend the Festival, sir."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"I'd like to hear more about this Festival, and Landru."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What about Landru?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Landru.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,My guess is we have until morning.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Let's put the time to good use.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Doctor, do atmospheric readings to determine whether there's anything in the air to account for all this."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Mister Lindstrom, correlate all that you've seen with any other sociological parallels, if any."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Spock.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Spock, Lindstrom."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Doc.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,He'll give her a shot.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,It'll calm her down.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Trust us.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What about Landru?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Who is he?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,No.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What if we are?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We can take care of ourselves.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"What do you mean, absorbed?"
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We're not going anywhere.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,I said we're not going anywhere.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Everything we've seen here so far seems to indicate some sort of compulsive involuntary stimulus to action.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Why did you kill that man?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You tell Landru that we'll come in our own time and that we'll speak to him.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Where to?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Quite a festival they had.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What do you make of all this?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Now they're back to normal.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What is it?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Phasers on stun.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Which way, Reger?"
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"We'll handle Landru, Just get us out of this."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,I don't want to hurt them.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Warn them back.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Phasers on stun, wide field."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Fire.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Fire.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Security.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Lieutenant O'Neil.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,He's one of our men.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Bring him along.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We still don't know what's happened to the Archons.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Which way?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Bring him along.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,A lighting panel.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Before Landru?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,How long ago was that?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,But not inconsistent with what we've seen.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Security.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Those staffs.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Hollow tubes.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Antennae for some sort of broadcast power.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"What is it, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Absorbed?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What others?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Who?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Give him a shot.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Keep him asleep.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Reger, I want some answers."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,This underground.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"If Landru is so powerful, how do you survive?"
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,The Archons.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Tell me about them.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Pulled them down from the skies?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,A starship?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Mister Spock, those power readings you took, are they?"
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Kirk to Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Status report.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Orbit condition.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Keep your shield up.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Do everything you can to maintain orbit.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We'll try and locate the source of the beam and stop it here.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What is it?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"But beautiful, Mister Spock, with no apparatus at this end."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You are holding my ship.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,I demand that you release it.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We mean you no harm.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Ours is a mission of peace and good will.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Put that away.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Landru, listen to me."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Wake up.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Mister Lesley.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"He was gone when I woke up, along with the other guard and Mister O'Neil."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Where is here?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,No.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,All our phasers are gone.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,I checked.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,That's locked.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Enough analysis.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Let's think of a way to get out of here.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What about the Lawgivers' inability to cope with the unexpected?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Are you suggesting the Lawgivers are mere computers, that they aren't human?"
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Doc.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,How?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Doc!
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Don't you know me?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Think, man."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,The Enterprise.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,The ship.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Remember?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You do remember!
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,No.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,All right.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Work on Bones.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,See if you can't
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Joy to you, friend."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Peace and contentment will fill you.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You will know the peace of Landru.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Peace and tranquillity to you.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,(in a whisper) Are you all right?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,I understand.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Landru.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,And?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Joy be yours, and tranquillity, my friend."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,The Body is one.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,My friends.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"(guiding Red and Spock away to a quiet corner) What is your theory, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"And when something unexplained happens, their routine is disrupted."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Landru.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You're thinking the same thing I am.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Mister Spock, the plug must be pulled."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Landru must die.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"That refers to a living, growing culture."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Do you think this one is?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What we need is more information about Landru.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,(Reger shakes his head) You said you wanted us to help you.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Never mind what the prophecy says.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"If you want to be liberated from Landru, we'll need your help."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Peace
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"to you, friend."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Joy and tranquillity.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Doc, I don't want to hurt you."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Spock.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Isn't that somewhat old-fashioned?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Robes.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Where is Landru?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Where do we find him?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,In this building?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You're going to take us there.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"(the two men are terrified at the prospect) Spock, call the Enterprise."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Snap out of it!
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Start acting like men.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Scotty, stand by."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We're doing the best we can.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,How's Mister Sulu?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Put a guard on him.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,That's an order.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Watch him.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Captain out.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What happened to him?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You said you wanted freedom.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,It's time you learned that freedom is never a gift.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,It has to be earned.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Come on.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We're going to find Landru.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,It's too late for that.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"All right, it's up to you."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Take us to Landru.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Open it.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Open it.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Landru!
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Landru.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We are the Archons.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We are the Archons.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We've come to speak.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We are the Archons.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We want to talk to you.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We have no intention of causing harm.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,We do not intend to die.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Listen to me.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Yes, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Let's have a look at the projector.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Of course.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,It had to be.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Landru.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,But no soul.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Pull out its plug, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Landru died six thousand years ago.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,But not his wisdom.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"He may have programmed you, but he could not have given you a soul."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You are a machine.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Yes.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What is the good?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Landru is dead.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You are a machine.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,A question has been put to you.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Answer it.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Then I put it to you that you have disobeyed the Prime Directive.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You are harmful to the Body.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,The body is dying.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You are destroying it.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What have you done to do justice to the full potential of every individual of the Body?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Without freedom of choice, there is no creativity."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Without creativity, there is no life."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,The body dies.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,The fault is yours.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Landru, answer the question."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You must create the good.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"That is the will of Landru, nothing else."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Then the evil must be destroyed.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,That is the Prime Directive.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,And you are the evil.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You are the evil.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,The evil must be destroyed.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Fulfill the Prime Directive.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,You
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,are the evil.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Fulfill the Prime Directive.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Well, Marplon, you're on your own now."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,I hope you're up to it.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,(to Lawgivers) And you can get rid of those robes.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"If I were you, I'd start look for another job."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Come in.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What about the ship?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Excellent, Scotty."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Stand by to beam up landing party.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Let's go and see how the others are doing.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Marplon can finish up here.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,What?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"But only a machine, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"The original Landru programmed it with all his knowledge but he couldn't give it his wisdom, his compassion, his understanding, his soul, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"You'd make a splendid computer, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Yes, Lindstrom."
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,How's it going?
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Sounds most promising.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Good luck.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,Yes.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,And we never got it.
KIRK,The Return of The Archons,"Just lucky, I guess."
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,"Doctor McCoy, transporter room."
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,Quickly.
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,"Captain, we're under attack."
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,There are heat beams of some kind coming up from the planet surface.
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,"Our shields are holding, but they're taking all our power."
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,"If we try to warp out or move on impulse, we'll lose our shields and burn up like a cinder."
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,Checking.
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,"We're going down, Captain."
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,"Unless we can get those beams off us so we can use our engines, we're due to hit atmosphere in less than twelve hours."
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,Impossible to break away.
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,I've tried the emergency bypass circuits but they haven't been effective.
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,"Mister Spock, I've been trying to reach you."
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,The orbit's still decaying.
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,"I give it six hours, more or less."
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,Those heat beams are still on us.
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,"You've got to cut them off, Mister Spock, or we'll cook."
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,"He's peaceful enough, but he worries me."
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,On Sulu?
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,"Captain, are you all right?"
SCOTT,The Return of The Archons,"The heat rays are gone, Captain, and Mister Sulu's back to normal."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Odd.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,The expression on that man's face.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,The mindlessness.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Vacant contentment.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Evidently they're not prepared to deal with out right disobedience.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,How did you know?
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Your analysis seems logical.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Fascinating.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"This is merely a hollow tube, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,No mechanism.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Totally illogical.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Yesterday, without apparent cause or reason, they wrought total havoc."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Yet today, now"
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Telepathy, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Amazing in this culture.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,It took a very advanced technology to construct a device like this.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Inconsistent with this environment
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Strong power generations, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Near here, but radiating in all directions."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,An underground?
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,How are you organised?
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Powerful enough to destroy a starship?
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Affirmative.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Captain.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Sensor beams, very strong."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,We're being probed.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,In this direction.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Block them out.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Too strong, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Can't be blocked.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Projection, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Unreal.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"He doesn't hear you, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Where's Doctor McCoy?
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,I should say they've been here and been removed.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Evidently a maximum security establishment.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Are you armed?
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,The natural result of being subjected to a hypersonic.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Sound waves.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Stronger, they might have killed us."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"As it was, they merely rendered us unconscious."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"We shouldn't depend on that happening again, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"In a society as well organised as this one seems to be, I cannot conceive of such an oversight going uncorrected."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Interesting, however."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Their reaction to your defiance was remarkably similar to the reaction of a computer when fed insufficient or contradictory data.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Quite human, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,It's simply that all the facts are not yet in.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,There are gaps.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Like Sulu.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"You've been corrected, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,You'd better go.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Doctor McCoy, what will happen to him?"
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Impossible.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,He's under extremely powerful control.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Little else we can do, unless you can think of a way to get through that door."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,And apparently commanding powers far beyond our comprehension.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Not simple, not ridiculous."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Very, very dangerous."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,What about the Captain?
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"We are not Archons, Marplon."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Where is Reger?
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Who is Landru?
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Joy be with you.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Peace and contentment.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Captain.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Quite all right.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Be careful of Doctor McCoy.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"I am formulating a theory, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Not here.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,The doctor.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"This is a soulless society, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"It has no spirit, no spark."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,All is indeed peace and tranquillity.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"The peace of the factory, the tranquillity of the machine."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,All parts working in unison.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Until new orders are received.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"The question is, who gives those orders?"
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"There is no Landru, Captain, not in the human sense."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Sir?
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Captain, our Prime Directive of non-interference."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Captain.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,status report.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Report, Scott."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Captain.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,(gives him a phaser)
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Useless, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,A projection.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,A machine.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,This whole society is a machine's concept of perfection.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Peace, harmony."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"The good of the Body, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,That's the key.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Are you aiding the body, or are you destroying it?"
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"Not necessary, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,They have no guidance.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Possibly for the first time in their lives.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Then the body dies.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Creativity is necessary for the health of the Body.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"What's left of him, after he built and programmed this machine six thousand years ago."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Marvellous.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"The late Landru, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,A marvellous feat of engineering.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,A computer capable of directing the lives of millions of human beings.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,Predictably metaphysical.
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"I prefer the concrete, the graspable, the provable."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,"That is very kind of you, Captain."
SPOCK,The Return of The Archons,How often mankind has wished for a world as peaceful and secure as the one Landru provided.
BILAR,The Return of The Archons,"Joy to you, friends."
BILAR,The Return of The Archons,You be strangers.
BILAR,The Return of The Archons,"Come for the Festival, are ya?"
BILAR,The Return of The Archons,Got a place to sleep it off yet?
BILAR,The Return of The Archons,Go round to Reger's house.
BILAR,The Return of The Archons,He's got rooms.
BILAR,The Return of The Archons,But you'll have to hurry.
BILAR,The Return of The Archons,It's almost the Red Hour.
BILAR,The Return of The Archons,"Tula, these folks come for the Festival."
BILAR,The Return of The Archons,"Your daddy can put them up, can't he?"
BILAR,The Return of The Archons,"Tula, come!"
BILAR,The Return of The Archons,"Morning, friends."
TULA,The Return of The Archons,You're from the Valley?
TULA,The Return of The Archons,"My father will be glad to put you up, though."
TULA,The Return of The Archons,It's right over there.
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,We've just arrived.
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,Are you Reger?
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,You have a daughter named Tula.
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,"Well, you'd better do something."
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,She's outside.
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,"But the girl, out there."
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,You didn't even try to bring her back.
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,What kind of father are you?
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,Your daughter.
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,That's the man.
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,"Captain, now that we've got Lieutenant O'Neil, let's beam up out of here."
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,(drawing his phaser) Maybe he'll hear this.
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,"Oh, does my head ache."
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,"Oh, is that what it was?"
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,Well?
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,Are we just going to stand here?
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,"Well, this is simply ridiculous."
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,A bunch of stone age characters running around in robes.
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,"I just wanted to say goodbye, Captain."
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,Couldn't be better.
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,"Already this morning, we've had half a dozen domestic quarrels and two genuine knock-down drag-outs."
LINDSTROM,The Return of The Archons,"It may not be paradise, but it's certainly human."
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,Welcome?
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,You are strangers?
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,"Hacom, these be strangers."
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,The Valley has different ways.
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,"No, of course not."
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,It's simply they may have different ways.
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,"Surely, Hacom, they already know."
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,Are they not infallible?
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,"But, Hacom"
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,It is true then.
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,You did not attend the Festival last night.
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,We must hide them.
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,Quickly.
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,The Lawgivers.
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,Landru will know.
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,He will come.
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,"No, Hacom."
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,It was a jest.
TAMAR,The Return of The Archons,I hear and obey the voice of Landru.
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,You came for the Festival?
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,Then how come you here?
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,"Reger, these are young men."
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,They are not old enough to be excused.
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,"Well, have they no Lawgivers in the Valley?"
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,Why be they not at the Festival?
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,The Red Hour has already struck.
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,Do you say that Landru is not everywhere?
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,"She is in festival, as you should be."
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,The Lawgivers should know.
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,You mock them!
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,You mock the Lawgivers.
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,And the strangers are not of the Body.
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,You will see.
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,He is the one.
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,He mocked the Lawgivers.
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,I heard him.
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,"The others, they were here, but they scorned the Festival."
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,I saw it.
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,"There, you see?"
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,Not of the body.
HACOM,The Return of The Archons,Landru.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Yes.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Yes.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,I know.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,It's Festival.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,It's the will of Landru.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,They're visitors.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,There.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"You see, Hacom?"
REGER,The Return of The Archons,They've merely come looking for a place to rest afterwards.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,They've come looking for shelter.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Can I turn them away?
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"Come, please."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"Come, please."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Hurry.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,You can return here at the close of the Festival.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,It's quiet.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,You'll have need of rest.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,The hour is struck.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,You can hear.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,(alarmed) Landru?
REGER,The Return of The Archons,You ask?
REGER,The Return of The Archons,You're strange.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,You scorn Festival?
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Are you?
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Are you?
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"No, no it's all over now."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"It's all over now, child."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,That's all right.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Quiet.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,It's all right.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,It's all over.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,It's Landru's will.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Then you're not of the Body.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,You couldn't be.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"Are you, are you Archons?"
REGER,The Return of The Archons,It was said more would follow.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,If you are indeed
REGER,The Return of The Archons,They're communing.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,We have time.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Come with me.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,To a place I know.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"You'll be safe there, but we must hurry."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Landru will come.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Peace.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"No, it wasn't Bilar."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,It was Landru.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"Let's hurry, we haven't much time."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,It's too late.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Look.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Landru.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,He's summoning the body.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"Perhaps through there, but Landru"
REGER,The Return of The Archons,They're in the Body.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,It's Landru.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Not anymore.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,He's been absorbed.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,The Lieutenant is one of them.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"When he wakes, Landru will find us through him."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Leave him there.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,He's our enemy.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,He's been absorbed.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Comes from a time before Landru.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Nobody knows positively.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Some say as long ago as six thousand years.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,He must not.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,He's been absorbed.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,The Body absorbs its enemies.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,It only kills when it has to.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"When the first Archons came, they were free, out of control, opposing the will of Landru."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"Many were killed, many more were absorbed."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"When he regains consciousness, Landru will find us through him."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,And if the others come
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"Those like you and me, who resist Landru."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,In threes.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"Myself, Tamar, who's dead now, and one other."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,I don't know.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Tamar was my contact.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,He must not regain consciousness.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,He'll destroy us all.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,He's of the Body.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"I don't know, Captain."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Some of us escape the directives.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"Not many, but a few."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,It was that way when the first Archons came.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"They had invaded the Body, but they resisted the will of Landru."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"You see, Landru had pulled them down from the skies."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Landru.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,(adopting a prayerful posture) Oh.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Oh.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,There was war.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Convulsions.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,The world was destroying itself.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Landru was our leader.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,He saw the truth.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,He changed the world.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"He took us back, back to a simple time."
REGER,The Return of The Archons,A time of peace and tranquillity.
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"No, no, I was wrong!"
REGER,The Return of The Archons,"I submit, I bear myself to the will of Landru!"
REGER,The Return of The Archons,No!
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Lawgivers!
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Help!
REGER,The Return of The Archons,Help me!
RIOTER,The Return of The Archons,Festival!
RIOTER,The Return of The Archons,Festival!
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,Excuse me.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,She's asleep.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,Captain.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,Put him over there.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,"He'll be coming around soon, Captain."
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,"Give me a decision, Captain."
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,He's coming out of it.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,"Hello, friend."
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,We were told to wait here.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,"Can I help you, friend?"
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,We all know one another and Landru.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,"You speak very strangely, friend."
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,Are you from away?
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,Ask Landru.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,He remembers.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,He knows and he watches.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,You are strange.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,Are you not of the Body?
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,"He goes to joy, peace, and tranquillity."
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,He goes to meet Landru.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,"Happiness is to all of us, blessed by Landru."
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,You speak in strange whispers.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,This is not the way of Landru.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,And peace and harmony.
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,Are you of the Body?
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,"Blessed be the Body, and health to all of its parts."
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,"Joy to you all, friends."
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,You're not of the Body!
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,You're not!
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,Lawgivers!
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,Lawgivers!
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,(trying to strangle Kirk) Traitor!
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,Traitors!
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,Traitors!
MCCOY,The Return of The Archons,Traitors!
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,"Tamar, stand clear."
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,You attacked the Body.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,You have heard the Word and disobeyed.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,You will be absorbed.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,You will be absorbed.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,The Good is all.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,Landru is gentle.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,You will come.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,It is the law.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,You must come.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,It is clear that you simply did not understand.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,I will re-phrase.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,You are ordered to accompany us to the absorption chambers.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,Out of order.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,You will obey.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,It is the word of Landru.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,You cannot.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,It is Landru.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,Come.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,Then you will die.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,Come.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,With thanks.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,Happy communing.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,You.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,Come.
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,Landru!
LAWGIVER,The Return of The Archons,"Guide us, Landru!"
ALL,The Return of The Archons,"Good morning, Bilar."
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,I am Landru.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,You have come as destroyers.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,You bring an infection.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,"You have come to a world without hate, without fear, without conflict."
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,"No war, no disease, no crime."
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,None of the ancient evils.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,Landru seeks tranquillity.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,Peace for all.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,The universal good.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,The good must transcend the evil.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,It shall be done.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,So it has been since the beginning.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,You will be absorbed.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,"Your individuality will merge into the unity of the good, and in your submergence into the common being of the Body, you will find contentment and fulfillment."
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,You will experience the absolute good.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,"Despite my efforts to save you, you have invaded the Body and you are causing great harm."
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,Obliteration is necessary.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,The infection is strong.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,"For the good of the Body, you must die."
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,It is a great sorrow.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,"All who saw you, all who know of your presence here must be excised."
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,The memory of the Body will be cleansed.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,I am Landru.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,You have intruded.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,Your devices have been neutralised.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,So it shall be with you.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,I am Landru.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,I am Landru.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,I am he.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,"All that he was, I am."
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,"His experience, his knowledge."
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,Your statement is irrelevant.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,You will be obliterated.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,The good of the Body is the Prime Directive.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,I am Landru.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,The good is the harmonious continuation of the Body.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,"The good is peace, tranquillity."
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,The good of the Body is the directive.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,The body is.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,It exists.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,It is healthy.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,Do you ask a question?
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,Insufficient data.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,"(sounding very machine-like, Davros-like) I am not programmed to answer that question."
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,"Peace, order, and tranquillity are maintained."
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,"The body lives, but I reserve creativity to me."
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,This is impossible.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,But there is evil.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,I think.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,I live.
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,"Landru, help me!"
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,Help me!
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,Help me!
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,Help me!
LANDRU,The Return of The Archons,Help me!
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,I am Marplon.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,It is your hour.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,Happy communing.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,"Have no fear, friend."
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,The effect is harmless.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,My name is Marplon.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,I was too late to save your first two friends.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,They have been absorbed.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,Beware of them.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,"He is unharmed, unchanged."
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,I am the third man in Reger's triad.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,We have been awaiting your return.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,"Whatever you may call yourselves, you are in fulfillment of prophecy."
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,We ask your help.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,He will join us.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,He is immune to absorption.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,Hurry.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,We have not much time.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,I cannot answer your questions now.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,"Landru, he will hear."
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,Here are your weapons.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,You may need them.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,Behave as you saw your Captain behave.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,It is done.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,It is the gift of Landru.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,(goes over to Kirk) I've brought your signalling devices.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,You may need them.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,The prophecy says
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,"No, no."
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,We do not see him.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,"We hear him, in the Hall of Audiences."
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,(reluctantly) Yes.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,No.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,He's still alive.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,He is here now.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,He sees.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,He hears.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,We have destroyed ourselves.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,"Please, no more."
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,This is the Hall of Audiences.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,But this is Landru.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,Landru speaks here.
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,Landru!
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,He comes!
MARPLON,The Return of The Archons,Is this truly Landru?
UHURA,The Return of The Archons,"Captain, Mister Lindstrom from the surface."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Nothing yet, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Nothing yet, Ambassador."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We're awaiting a reply.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Today's the
first time we've had any evidence they've picked up our signal."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Are you sure?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Code seven-ten means under no circumstances are we to approach
that planet."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",No circumstances what so ever.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mister Fox, it is their planet."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","By disregarding code seven-ten, you might well involve us in an
interplanetary war."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You are.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I'm thinking about this ship, my crew."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yes, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",This is the Captain.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Condition Yellow Alert.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Phaser crews stand by.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Deflector shields up.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We're going in.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Peacefully, I hope."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","But peacefully or not, we're going in."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Anything else?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Not alone.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm taking some security people with me.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I can't risk beaming you down there until I know what kind of
reception you're going to receive."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Your safety is my responsibility.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Those are my orders, sir."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",What co-ordinates?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Final sensor readings?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Ship's defences?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Good.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Landing party will pick up phaser number one's from the
arsenal."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Keep them inconspicuous.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Mister Scott.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",The ship is yours.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Take care of her until I come back.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We'll do our best.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Let's go.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I'm Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise,
representing the United Federation of Planets."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Yes?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I had orders to come here.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Why did your people tell us to stay
away?"
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I see no danger here.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm Captain Kirk.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","This is my first officer, Mister Spock,
Lieutenants Galloway, Osborne, Yeoman Tamula."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","My mission is to establish diplomatic relations between your
people and mine."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Would you mind telling me why?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You're still at war?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You conceal it very well.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Mister Spock?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",To say the least.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Don't you take shelter?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",What is it?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Do you hear any explosions, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mea, if this is an attack, may I ask what weapons the enemy is
using?"
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Kirk to Bridge.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Scotty?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Scanners operative on the planet's surface?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Anything unusual?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Thank you.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Kirk out.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Sir, I have been in contact with my ship, which has had this
entire planet under surveillance."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","All during this so-called attack of
yours,
we have been monitoring you."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","There's been no attack, no explosions, no
radiations, no disturbances whatsoever."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If this is some sort of game
you're playing"
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Computer don't kill a half million people.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",To report?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You mean to tell me your people just walk into a disintegration
machine when they're told to?"
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",What has happened?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We require a great deal.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I wish to speak to Anan Seven.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","He'll have more casualty lists than he knows what to do with if
he doesn't get in here and talk to me."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Your duty doesn't include stepping into a disintegrator and
disappearing."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Is that all it means to you?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",To report and die?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Then how can you stand
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","No, I don't see that at all."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Yes.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Anan Seven.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Good news, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","The Eminians have agreed to the
establishment of full normal diplomatic relations."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","They've also extended an invitation to all personnel to come
ashore, for shore leave."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","They've assured me that our people will have a
wonderful time."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Are you sure you can do it, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Do your best.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Thank you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We get our communicators back and try and contact the ship.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mister Spock, we'll need more weapons."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We'll try to take it easy, but if we're forced to kill"
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",A disintegration machine.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Mea.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",What do you think you're doing?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You're not going in there.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",No you're not.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mister Spock, that guard."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'll cover you.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","All right, you people, clear out of the way."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Throwing a monkey wrench into the machinery.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I've done it.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",(The booth finally blows up.)
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Come on, let's get
out of here."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",The last place they'll look for us is the place we escaped from.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",(gives her a gun) Cover the door.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Are you that anxious to die?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mister Spock, how did that little raid work out?"
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Will it reach the ship?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Work on it.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We've got to contact the ship.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mea, I want you to
give me a complete layout of this building complex."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","How do I get to the
War Room?"
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Now listen to me.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm trying to help you.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","To save your life and
the lives of millions like you."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If you help me, maybe I can do it."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If
you don't, you'll die,
we'll die, and the killing will go on."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Or are you that fond of the war?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We're going to try and stop the killing.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We're trying to help.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Believe me.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Tell me what I want to know.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Please.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I didn't come to drink.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",A very efficient weapon.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm not afraid of using it.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I am?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We're less cold-blooded about it than you are.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I want to contact my ship.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Where are my communicators?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You take a lot of chances, Councilman."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If I were you, I'd think about saving my life."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm not interested in discussing our differences.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You don't seem
to realise the risk you're taking."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We don't make war with computers and
herd the casualties into suicide stations."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We make the real thing,
Councilman."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I could destroy this planet.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I don't need the ship for that.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",That's exactly what I mean.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You seem to think I'm joking.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Where are the communicators?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Something like that.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",My people are not responsible for your agreements.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",That seems to frighten you.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Yes.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You're quite right.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm a barbarian.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You said it yourself.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Oh, no."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You were quite accurate.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I plan to prove it to you.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Scotty, General Order Twenty Four."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Two hours!
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",In two hours!
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",All that it means is that I won't be around for the destruction.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You heard me give General Order Twenty Four.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","That means in two hours
the Enterprise will destroy Eminiar Seven."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I didn't start it, Councilman, but I'm liable to finish it."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You're wrong.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It hasn't begun.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You have less than two hours, Councilman."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Stop it?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm counting on it.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Hold it!
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Over there.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You, over there."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Move, move, move."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Now we'll talk.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",No.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I need the help.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","In there, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Come in, Scotty."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Everything's secure here.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Maintain position.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If everything goes
according to plan, you can beam us up in ten minutes."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If you don't hear
from us,
carry out General Order Twenty Four on schedule."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Cross your fingers.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Kirk out.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Death, destruction, disease,
horror."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","That's what war is all about, Anan."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","That's what makes it a
thing to be avoided."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You've made it neat and painless.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","So neat and
painless, you've had no reason to stop it."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","And you've had it for five
hundred years."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Since it seems to be the only way I can save my crew and
my ship, I'm going to end it for you, one way or another."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mister
Ambassador."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Would you mind taking these people out into the corridor and
holding them there."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",(to Sar) You.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Come with me.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Mister Osborne.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Our communicators, weapons."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","All right, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yes, go on."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Good.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Get him out of here.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Let's go.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Against the wall!
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yes, I do."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I've given you back the horrors of war.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","The Vendikans
now assume that you've broken your agreement and that you're preparing
to wage real war with real weapons."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They'll want do the same.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Only the
next attack they launch will do a lot more than count up numbers in a
computer."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","They'll destroy cities, devastate your planet."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You of course
will want to retaliate."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If I were you, I'd start making bombs."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yes,
Councilman, you have a real war on your hands."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You can either wage it
with real weapons, or you might consider an alternative."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Put an end to
it."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Make peace.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",All right.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It's instinctive.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",But the instinct can be fought.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We're human beings with the blood of a million savage years on our
hands, but we can stop it."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We can admit that we're killers, but we're
not going to kill today."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",That's all it takes.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Knowing that we won't
kill today."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Contact Vendikar.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I think you'll find that they're just as
terrified, appalled, horrified as you are, that they'll do anything to
avoid the alternative I've given you."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Peace or utter destruction.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","It's
up to you."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Scotty?
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Cancel implementation of General Order Twenty Four.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Alert
transporter room."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We're ready to beam up.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Lay in a course for Argona Two, Navigator."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Mister Scott.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Good.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Did I, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","They've been killing three million people a
year."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It had been going on for five hundred years.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","An actual attack
wouldn't have killed any more people than one of their computer
attacks, but it would have ended their ability to make war."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","The
fighting would have been over permanently."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",No.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It was a calculated risk.
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Still, the Eminians keep a very
orderly society, and actual war is a very messy business."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","A very, very
messy business."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I had a feeling that they would do anything to avoid
it, even talk peace."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Sometimes a feeling, Mister Spock, is all we humans have to go
on."
KIRK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Why, Mister Spock, you almost make me believe in miracles."
UHURA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Nothing, Captain."
UHURA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Hailing frequencies are open.
UHURA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Captain, message coming in from Eminiar Seven."
UHURA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Sir, it's code
seven-ten."
UHURA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Positive.
UHURA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It repeats over and over.
UHURA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mister Scott, message coming in from the Captain."
UHURA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","A channel is open, Mister Ambassador."
UHURA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You
will be speaking to Anan Seven, head of the High Council of the Eminian
Union."
UHURA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mister Scott, it's Mister Spock."
UHURA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Message from Eminiar Seven, Captain."
UHURA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Ambassador Fox reports
negotiations underway with Vendikar."
UHURA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Outlook hopeful.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Have you received an answer to your message yet, Captain?"
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Is that supposed to mean something?
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You will disregard that signal, Captain."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Captain, in the past twenty years, thousands of lives have been
lost in this quadrant."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Lives that could have been saved if the
Federation had a treaty port here."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We mean to have that port and I'm
here to get it."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm quite prepared to take that risk.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I have my orders, Captain, and now you have yours."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You will
proceed on course."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Achieve orbit status and just leave the rest to me.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You're well aware that my mission gives me the power of command.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I now
exercise it."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You will proceed on course.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",That's a direct order.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Kirk, what's this about you going down alone?"
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It is my prerogative.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","(entering the Bridge) You'll do no such thing, Mister Scott."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You have taken defensive measures.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",There are no buts.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Obviously it's a misunderstanding, and one of
my jobs is to clear up misunderstandings."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We have no proof of that.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","And I'm responsible for the success of this mission, and that's
more important than this ship."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Is that clear?
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We came here to establish
diplomatic relations with these people."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",This is a diplomatic matter.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If you check your regulations, you'll
find that my orders get priority."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I'll try to make contact with the
planetary officials."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Lieutenant, open up a channel and keep it open."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Tell them to expect a priority one message from me.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","There will be no
punitive measures, gentlemen."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Those are my orders.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mister Anan, this is Robert Fox"
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Special Ambassador for the United
Federation of Planets."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We have approached you openly
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","With the intent of establishing formal
and friendly relations between our peoples, but now,"
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","For some reason, you have attacked us, and
apparently you're holding several special representatives of our
Federation."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Thank you.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I thought perhaps it was all a mistake.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I understand.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mister Anan, I presume that you
have our ship's Captain on hand when I beam down."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I'm sure that from this day forward, your planet and our
Federation will attain the deepest friendship."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I look forward to seeing
you."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Diplomacy, gentlemen, should be a job left to diplomats."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You will,
of course, immediately resume a peaceful status."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",What did you say?
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You are taking orders from me.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You will lower the screens as a
sign of good faith."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",My authority.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I want you and expect you to obey my lawful orders.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Your refusal to comply with my orders has endangered the entire
success of this mission."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I can have you sent to a penal colony for
this."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Your name will figure prominently in my report to the Federation
Central."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I am Robert Fox.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Have I the honour of addressing Anan Seven?
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I beg your pardon?
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You mean we are to be killed?
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",What are you doing?
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I'm a representative of the United Federation
of Planets!"
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",A special representative!
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Spock!
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","What are you doing, Mister Spock?"
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They have him.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",The guards told us.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","They took him to the Council
Room under heavy guard."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I've never been a soldier, Mister Spock, but I learn very quickly."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yes, Captain."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Gentlemen, if you please."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","As a third party interested only in peace and the establishment of
normal relations, I should be glad to offer my services as negotiator
between you and Vendikar."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I've had some small experiences in such
matters."
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Then it's long overdue.
FOX,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Shall we go?
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","In view of code seven-ten, Captain, may I suggest"
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We know very little about them.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Their
civilisation is advanced."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","They've had space flight for several
centuries, but they've never ventured beyond their own solar system."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","When first contacted more than fifty years ago, Eminiar Seven was at
war with its nearest neighbour."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","The Earth expedition making the report failed to return from its
mission."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",The USS Valiant.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Listed as missing in space.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Transporter room standing by, Captain."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We've selected a site which from the traffic seems to be near an
official establishment."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",No hostility directed toward us.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","No apparent notice taken of us
at all, which seems strange."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They did scan us when we assumed orbit.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Obviously, they know we're here."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Screens down, but all defensive details on general alert status,
Captain."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Sir, we have completely scanned your planet."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We find it highly
advanced, prosperous in a material sense, comfortable for your people,
and peaceful in the extreme."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Yet you say you are at war.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","There is no
evidence of this."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",With whom are you at war?
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Strange.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Are these attacks frequent?
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","None, Captain."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Yeoman Tamula.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Tricorder readings.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Radiation.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Disturbances of any kind.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Computers, Captain."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They fight their war with computers.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Totally.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Then the attack by Vendikar was theoretical.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",There is a certain scientific logic about it.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I do not approve.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I understand.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Limited telepathic abilities are inherent in Vulcanians,
Captain."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It may work.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It may not.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","My pleasure, Captain."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I understand.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","An entrance, Captain, but no exit."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","They go in, but they do not
come out."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",So I would assume.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Sir, there's a multi-legged creature crawling on your shoulder."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We captured four of their disrupter-type weapons, two complete
outfits of male clothing, and perhaps most important of all, one of
their communication devices."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Not at this time.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Its range is restricted in comparison with
ours."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I may be able to alter its components, but it will take time."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Spock to Enterprise, come in."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Is the ship all right?
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",The Captain is overdue.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We've suffered no casualties among us.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",This is important.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Under no circumstances shall any one beam down from
the Enterprise."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They'd be killed the moment they arrived.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",The Ambassador?
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Orbit out to maximum phaser range and stand
by for further orders."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Spock out.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Find the Ambassador and the Captain.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yeoman Tamula, you stay
here and prevent this young lady from immolating herself."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Knock her
down if necessary."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",This is a killing situation.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Do what you must to
protect yourself."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Clear?
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Please, Mister Fox."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Ladies and gentlemen, please move quickly
away from the chamber or you may be injured."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Practicing a peculiar variety of diplomacy, sir."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I'll take you to a place of comparative safety, then I must find
the Captain."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","By now, Mister Ambassador, I'm sure you realise that normal
diplomatic procedures are ineffective here."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Very well, sir."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We need all the help we can get.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I had assumed you needed help.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I see I'm in error.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","These are the attack computers,
Captain."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","That one's defence, that one computes the casualties."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","They're
all tied in with a subspace transmission unit, which keeps them in
constant contact with their Vendikan counterparts."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","At the moment contact is broken, it abrogates the agreement
between the two warring parties."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",This one's the key.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",The circuit is now locked.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Destroy this one,
and they'll all go."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","There's a chance it may work, Captain."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Captain, you took a big chance."
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon",A feeling is not much to go on.
SPOCK,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Captain, you almost make me believe in luck."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yes, sir."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Aye, aye, sir."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",And have a bonny trip.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Scott here, Captain."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Of course, sir."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",As per orders.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Nothing, sir."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",All quiet.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Aye, Doctor, that we should, but we haven't, and we cannot raise
them."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You know, if there'd been trouble, they should have at least
managed to get word back to us."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",What would you suggest?
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Would you have me open fire?
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Scott here, Captain."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Mister Fox'll be glad to hear about that.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Er, Captain?"
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",All personnel?
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Aye, aye, Captain."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We'll start forming shore
parties immediately."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Scott out.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Well now, what do you think of that?"
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Well, I do."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Computer, last message received and recorded from
Captain Kirk."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Run it through analyser.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Question.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Is it or is it not the
Captain's voice?"
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",A voice duplicator?
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Well, they've got them, Doctor, and now they're trying to get
us."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yes, Mister DePaul?"
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Well, now."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They're taking pot shots at us.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Holding, Mister
DePaul?"
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Aye, but what about our Captain and the landing party down there
somewhere?"
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If they're alive, and if we can find them."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",That's a big planet.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We can't fire full phasers with our screens up, and We can't
lower our screens with their disruptors on us."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Of course I could treat
them to a few dozen photon torpedoes."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mister Fox, we're under attack."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They're trying to knock us down.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Of course, but"
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm responsible for the safety of this ship.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","But they're the ones who're looking for a fight, Mister Fox."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Diplomats.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","The best diplomat I know is a fully activated phaser
bank."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Maintain status, Mister DePaul."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","No, sir, I will not."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I'll not lower the screens, not until the Captain tells me to."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I know about your authority, but the screens stay up."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","No, sir."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I won't lower the screens.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","That you can, sir, but I won't lower the screens."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Aye.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","The haggis is in the fire for sure, but I'll not lower my
defences on the word of that mealy-mouthed gentleman down below."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Not
until I know what happened to the Captain."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Scotty here, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Go ahead.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We've been through a bit, but we're all right now."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","How
about the Captain and you?"
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",That ties it.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","That popinjay Fox went down a
couple minutes ago."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I knew it had a rotten ring to it.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",This is the USS Enterprise.
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Open a channel, Lieutenant."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","This is the
commander of the USS Enterprise."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","All cities and installations on Eminiar
Seven have been located, identified, and fed into our fire-control
system."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",In one hour and forty five minutes
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","The entire inhabited surface of your planet
will be destroyed."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You have that long to surrender your
hostages."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Aye, Captain, are you all right?"
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Aye, aye, Captain."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Is there anything else we can do?
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Scott here, Captain."
SCOTT,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Space details set, Captain."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They will materialise there.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Remember your instructions; They are
to be treated correctly, nothing more."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I know.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm Mea 3.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I congratulate you on your instrumentation.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You've come directly to the Division of Control.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If you'll follow me,
please."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Captain, I wish"
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You were warned not to come here.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","It was for your own safety, Captain."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",The danger exists.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Nevertheless, you are here."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","It would be morally
incorrect to do less than extend our hospitality."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Anan 7 and members of
the High Council await you."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If you will come this way, please."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It will not last long.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","There is no shelter, Captain."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Oh yes, and we will retaliate immediately."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Oh!
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",A hit right here in the city.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Fusion bombs, materialised by the enemy over their targets."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I have been sent to ask if you require
anything."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",He's busy co-ordinating casualty lists.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Don't you understand?
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Our duty
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I'm afraid mine does, Captain."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I too have been declared a
casualty."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I must report to a disintegrator by noon tomorrow.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","My life is as dear to me as yours is to you, Captain."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Don't you see?
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If I refuse to report, and others refuse, then
Vendikar would have no choice but to launch real weapons."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We would have
to do the same to defend ourselves."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",More than people would die then.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","A
whole civilisation would be destroyed."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Surely you can see that ours is
a better way."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It's been our way for almost five hundred years.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Is there anything
I can bring you?"
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm going
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",But I must.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Please.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","All right, don't worry about me."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",What are you doing?
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You can't do this.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Captain, you've got to let me go."
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",My time is almost up.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You don't understand.
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",No!
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",What are you going to do?
MEA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I believe you, but"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Welcome to Eminiar Seven.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Well, Captain, what can we do for you?"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",That is impossible.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Because of the war.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We have been at war for five hundred years.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Casualties among our civilian population total from one to three
million dead each year from direct enemy attack."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","That is one reason,
Captain,
why we told you to stay away."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","As long as your ship is orbiting our
planet, it is in severe danger."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","The third planet in our system, called Vendikar."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Originally
settled by our people and now a ruthless enemy."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Highly advanced
technologically."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Please excuse me.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Vendikar is attacking.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mea, care for our
guests."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yes, I see it."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They were warned.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Alert a security detachment.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They may be needed.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","It's a vicious attack, extremely destructive."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Fortunately, our
defences are firming, but our casualties are high."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Very high.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","This is no game, Captain."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Half a million people have just been
killed."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Activate the attack units, Sar."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Launch immediate counter attack.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yes, of course."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Deaths have been registered.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Of course they have twenty four
hours to report."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",To our disintegration machines.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You must understand, Captain, we
have been at war for five hundred years."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Under ordinary conditions,
no civilisation could withstand that."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",But we have reached a solution.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Oh, no, quite real."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",An attack is mathematically launched.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I lost
my wife in the last attack."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Our civilisation lives.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","The people die, but
our culture goes on."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We have a high consciousness of duty, Captain."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm glad you approve.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Good.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Then you will recall I warned you not to come here.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You
chose to ignore my warning."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I'm sorry, but it's happened."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Once your ship was in orbit about our planet, it became a
legitimate target."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","It has been classified destroyed by a tricobalt
satellite explosion."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","All persons aboard your ship have twenty four
hours to report to our disintegration machines."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","In order to ensure
their co-operation, I have ordered you, Captain, and your party held in
custody until they surrender."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If possible, we shall spare your ship,
Captain, but its passengers and crew are already dead."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",(It sounds like Kirk but it isn't.)
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yes, Mister Scott?"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",All personnel.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We'll transport up trained Eminians to assume
support positions."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Those are my orders, Mister Scott."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","All security personnel, Federation prisoners have escaped."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","They
are to be found."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They are armed.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If they resist, do what is necessary."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Planetary disruptor banks, calculate orbit of star cruiser now
circling."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Stand by to fire.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Full power.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","In ten seconds, open fire."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Destroy the star cruiser.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Those are
the orders of the Council."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Time is running out.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We have been unable to
destroy the Earth ship."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","One of our disintegration chambers has been
eliminated and we have already fallen far behind in our quota."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","This is
a grave crisis and I am at a loss to know how to proceed."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","What is the great immorality, open honesty or a deception which
may save our lives?"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Put me through to the Earth Ambassador.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","A great honour, Mister Ambassador."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","A mistake, Mister Ambassador."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We are at war.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","An error in our sensors indicated that
your ship was about to attack us."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm giving orders that our attack be stopped.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Now, as to your representatives, you
have my sacred word as an Eminian that they are alive and well."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We are most anxious to establish relations with you, Mister
Fox."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We will make arrangements to receive you.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","(to
Sar, closing the channel) The minute their screens are down, open fire."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","(reopening the channel) I apologise deeply for the
misunderstanding."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","These are trying times for us, you understand."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","He will be there, sir."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I give you my word.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Won't you join me in a drink, Captain?"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You'll find our trova most
interesting."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I assume that is what you used to destroy disintegration chamber
number twelve."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",My first impression was correct.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You are a barbarian.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Don't sound so incredulous, Captain."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Of course you are.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We all
are."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","A killer first, a builder second."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","A hunter, a warrior, and let's
be honest, a murderer."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","That is our joint heritage, is it not?"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","What do you want, Captain?"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",In a safe place.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You're worried about your ship, Captain."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I'm trying to save a
world."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Won't you have a drink, Captain?"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",And then we can discuss our differences.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Why do you think I don't let you talk to your ship ?
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You mean, all by yourself with a disruptor, you can destroy this
planet?"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I had no idea you were so formidable.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If I told you, Captain, would you walk right out and get them?"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Very well, Captain."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They're in the War Room.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Go left down the
corridor, left again."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They are unguarded.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Is he alive?
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Pity.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Man like that would have preferred to die
fighting."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Take him to the Council Room.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Ambassador Fox?
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Welcome to Eminiar, Mister Ambassador."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mister Ambassador, I am truly sorry for what
must happen."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You and your party have been declared war casualties.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You will be
taken immediately
to one of our casualty stations so that your deaths may be recorded."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","That is correct, Mister Ambassador."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I regret it very much, but
there is nothing I can do about it."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Captain, surely you can see the position we
are in."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If your people do not report to our disintegration chambers, it
is a violation of an agreement that dates back five hundred years."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You will be responsible for an escalation that will destroy
everything."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Millions of people horribly killed.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Complete destruction of
our culture here and yes, the culture on Vendikar."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Disaster, disease,
starvation, horrible, lingering death, pain and anguish!"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It would frighten any sane man.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Don't you understand, Captain?"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We have done away with all that.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Now you are threatening to bring it down on us again.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Are those five
hundred people of yours more important than the hundreds of millions of
innocent people on Eminiar and Vendikar?"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",What kind of monster are you?
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I had hoped I'd spoken only figuratively.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Open a channel to the Enterprise.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","You give me no choice, Captain."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We
are not bandits, but you force us to act as bandits."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Enterprise, this is Anan Seven, First Councilman of the High
Council of Eminiar."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We hold your Captain, his party, your
Ambassador and his party prisoners."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Unless you immediately start transportation
of all personnel aboard your ship to the surface, the hostages will be
killed."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You have thirty minutes.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I mean it, Captain."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Planetary defence System, open fire on the Enterprise!"
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You wouldn't do this.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Hundreds of millions of people.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You see?
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It's started.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",What I want or don't want has nothing to do with it.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Escalation
is automatic."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You can stop it!
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",What can I do?
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Somebody, please tell me."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",You realise what you have done?
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",There can be no peace.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Don't you see?
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We've admitted it to
ourselves."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We're a killer species.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It's instinctive.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","It's the same with
you."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Your General Order Twenty Four.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",There may be a chance.
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon","We have a direct channel with Vendikar's
High Council."
ANAN,"A
Taste of Armageddon",It hasn't been used in centuries.
TAMULA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Sir?
TAMULA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Working, sir."
TAMULA,"A
Taste of Armageddon",No evidence.
TAMULA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","What do we do now, Captain?"
TAMULA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Why did we come back here, Captain?"
TAMULA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","What are you going to do, Mister Spock?"
TAMULA,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yes, sir."
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Look, Anan."
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon",(another flare on another screen)
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Just as it happened fifty years ago.
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yes, Councilman."
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon","The central channel, Anan."
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon","The Earth ambassador's calling with an
urgent message."
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Yes, Councilman."
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Councilman, I received a message from Vendikar."
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Our time is nearly
up."
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Our quota is short by several thousand.
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon","They accuse us of reneging
on the treaty."
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon",What are you going to do?
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Now wait a minute.
SAR,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Please, please!"
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I tell you, we should have heard something
by now."
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We can't just sit here.
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Me?
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I'm a doctor.
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If I were an officer of the line, I'd"
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Of course not.
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon",I don't know.
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Well, I guess that answers our questions, Mister Scott."
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon","They're
not very friendly, are they?"
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon",We get them out.
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Not too big for the Enterprise to handle if it has to.
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They're holding our Captain.
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mister Fox, they faked a message from the Captain, they've
launched an attack against our ship."
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Now
you want us to trust them openly?"
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Well, Scotty, now you've done it."
MCCOY,"A
Taste of Armageddon",But you didn't know that it would work.
COMPUTER,"A
Taste of Armageddon",In place.
COMPUTER,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Negative.
COMPUTER,"A
Taste of Armageddon",A close copy.
COMPUTER,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Ninety eight percent probability.
SECURITY,"A
Taste of Armageddon","The Federation prisoners have
attacked their guard and escaped."
SECURITY,"A
Taste of Armageddon",They are armed.
SECURITY,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Disintegration
station number twelve destroyed, Councilman, apparently by disruptor
fire."
SECURITY,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Councilman, planetary disruptor banks locked onto
target."
SECURITY,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Standing by.
SECURITY,"A
Taste of Armageddon","I'm sorry, Councilman."
SECURITY,"A
Taste of Armageddon","The target has moved out of
range."
SECURITY,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Councilman, Disintegrator station eleven has been
destroyed."
SECURITY,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Guard positions in tunnels eight and ten fail to answer.
SECURITY,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Earth party reported seen in corridor 4A.
DEPAUL,"A
Taste of Armageddon",All stations reporting.
DEPAUL,"A

DEPAUL,"A

DEPAUL,"A

DEPAUL,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Correction.
DEPAUL,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Mister Scott.
DEPAUL,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Sensor readings just shot off the scale.
DEPAUL,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Screens firm, sir."
DEPAUL,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Extremely powerful sonic vibrations.
DEPAUL,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Decibels eighteen to the twelfth power.
DEPAUL,"A
Taste of Armageddon","If those screens weren't up,
we'd be totally disrupted by now."
DEPAUL,"A
Taste of Armageddon","Mister Scott, disruptor beams are no longer hitting us."
GUARD,"A
Taste of Armageddon",Get in line.
SPINELLI,"Space
Seed","Coming up on it fast, sir."
SPINELLI,"Space
Seed","Rigging for tractor beam, sir."
SPINELLI,"Space
Seed","Aye, aye, sir."
SPINELLI,"Space
Seed","On course, sir."
SPINELLI,"Space
Seed",Warp factor two.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Are you certain of your sensor readings?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Origin?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Thank you.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","We're reading it, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","I thought you said it couldn't
possibly be an Earth vessel."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",An emotional Earth weakness of mine.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",There it is.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","An old Earth vessel, similar to the DY=500 class."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Then it's a derelict, its signal left on automatic."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Weapons status.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Bioscanners report.
KIRK,"Space

KIRK,"Space
Seed","Weapons department, maintain battle stations."
KIRK,"Space

KIRK,"Space
Seed","Alien bodies, Bones?"
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Then you can check the registry.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","All right, all right, gentlemen."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",As you were.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Rig for tractor
beam, Helm."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Lock onto that vessel.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","The Bridge is yours, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Care to join the landing
party, Doctor?"
KIRK,"Space
Seed",I'm not.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Oh, I'll need somebody familiar with the late
20th-Century Earth."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Here's a chance for that historian to do something
for a change."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",What's her name?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",McIvers?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Very interesting.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","You ready, Bones?"
KIRK,"Space
Seed","You're an old-fashioned boy, McCoy."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Where's that historian?
KIRK,"Space
Seed","(McGivers enters) Come on, Lieutenant"
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Energise.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","(Men and women are lying in clear-sided
compartments, seemingly asleep.)"
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Scotty?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Suspended animation.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Is it possible they're still alive after centuries of travel?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Scotty?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Could he be the leader?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",The leader.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Lieutenant?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",The others?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Circuit shorting.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Can we?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",What happens if we get him out of there?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",How long have you been sleeping?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Two centuries we estimate.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Landing party to Enterprise.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Come in.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Lock in on McCoy's beam.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","He's transporting back with a casualty
we discovered here."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Kirk to boarding party.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Scotty, any records, log books of any kind?"
KIRK,"Space
Seed",How many alive?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Kirk out.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Seventy two alive.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","A group of people dating back to the
1990s."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","A discovery of some importance, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","There are a great
many unanswered questions about those years."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Botany Bay.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","That was the name of a penal colony on shores of
Australia, wasn't it?"
KIRK,"Space
Seed",If they took that name for their vessel
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Oh?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Yes.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",So much for my theory.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",I'm still waiting to hear yours.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","And that irritates you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Yeah.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","My apologies, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",You suspect some danger in them?
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Well, we'd better get some facts."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Rig for towing.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Make course for Starbase Twelve.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Bones?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",My compliments.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",An improved breed of human.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","That's what the Eugenics War was all
about."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",I'd like to talk to you.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","If I were to rate your performance as a member of the landing
party today I"
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Lieutenant, at any one time, the safety of this entire vessel
might depend upon the performance of a single crewman, and the fact
that you find a man
strangely compelling to you personally"
KIRK,"Space
Seed",And men were more adventuresome then.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Bolder, more colourful."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Good.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","If I can have honesty, it's easier to overlook mistakes."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",That's all.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Fair?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",(leaves)
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Bridge.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",On my way.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","James Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",And your name?
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Our heading is Starbase Twelve, a planet in the Gamma 400 star
system."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Our command base in this sector.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Is that of any use to you?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Seventy two of your life-support canisters are still functioning.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",As soon as we reach Starbase Twelve.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",And now
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Khan.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Nothing else?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",What was the exact date of your lift off?
KIRK,"Space
Seed","We know it was sometime
in the early 1990s, but"
KIRK,"Space
Seed","The facts I need, Mister Khan, will take very little time."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","For
example, the nature of your expedition."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Yes, I understand."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","You have two hundred years of catching up to
do."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",They're available to any patient on the viewing screen.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Doctor
McCoy will show you how to tie into the library tapes."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","This Khan is not what I expected of a
twentieth century man."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Common courtesy, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","He'll spend the rest of his days
in our time."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",It's only decent to help him catch up.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Would you estimate
him to be a product of selective breeding?"
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Well, they were hardly supermen."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","They were aggressive, arrogant."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",They began to battle among themselves.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Interesting, if true."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","They created a group of Alexanders,
Napoleons."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",That fact isn't in the history texts.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Lieutenant McGivers' idea to welcome Khan to our century.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Just
how strongly is she attracted to him?"
KIRK,"Space
Seed","My curiosity's official, not personal, Bones."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Forgive my curiosity, Mister Khan, but my officers are anxious to
know more about your extraordinary journey."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","You have a tendency to express ideas in military terms, Mister
Khan."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",This is a social occasion.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",You fled.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Why?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Were you afraid?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",But you left at the very time mankind needed courage.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",We?
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Name, Khan, as we know him today."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","(Spock changes the picture)
Name, Khan Noonien Singh."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",He was the best of the tyrants and the most dangerous.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","They were
supermen, in a sense."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Stronger, braver, certainly more ambitious, more
daring."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Mister Spock, we humans have a streak of barbarism in us."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Appalling, but there, nevertheless."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Mister Spock, you misunderstand us."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","We can be against him and
admire him all at the same time."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Totally.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",This is the Captain.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Put a twenty four hour security on
Mister Khan's quarters, effective immediately."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Unusual treatment for Khan Noonien Singh.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",I'd like those answers now.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","First, the purpose of your star
flight."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Why?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Because I'm not a product of controlled genetics?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Thank you.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",They've all been answered.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Maintain.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",(he answers the intercom) Bridge.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Sound security alert.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Atmospheric controls cut off.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Engineering.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Scotty.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",This is the Bridge.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",What's going on down there?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Flood all decks with neural gas.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Contact Starbase Twelve.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Negative.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",I'm a little pleased myself.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Situation?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Our only chance is the intruder control circuit.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Although he's
cut it off at the Bridge."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Gas all decks but this one.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Where's Khan?
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",This hearing is now in session.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Under the authority vested in me
by Starfleet Command, I declare all charges and specifications in this
matter have been dropped."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Mister Spock, our heading takes us near the Ceti Alpha star
system."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","But no more than Australia's Botany Bay colony was at the
beginning."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Those men went on to tame a continent, Mister Khan."
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Can you
tame a world?"
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Yes.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",I understand.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",Lieutenant Marla McGivers.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Given a choice of
court martial or accompanying them there."
KIRK,"Space
Seed",This hearing is closed.
KIRK,"Space
Seed",The statement Lucifer made when he fell into the pit.
KIRK,"Space
Seed","'It is
better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.'"
KIRK,"Space
Seed","Yes, Mister Spock, it would indeed."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Definitely a space vessel of some type.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Unknown.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",It could hardly be an Earth ship.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","There have been no
flights into this sector for years."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","I fail to understand why it always gives you pleasure to see me
proven wrong."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Much older.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","DY-100 class, to be exact."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Captain, the last such
vessel was built centuries ago, back in the 1990s."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Or an old Earth ship being used by aliens.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Sensor reading, Captain."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Some sort of equipment functioning on
that vessel."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Hull surface is pitted with meteor scars.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","However, scanners make
out a name."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",SS Botany Bay.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",No such vessel listed.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Records of that period are fragmentary,
however."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",The mid=1990s was the era of your last so-called World War.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Of course.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Your attempt to improve the race through selective
breeding."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Lieutenant McGivers.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Attention.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","The following personnel report to transporter
room."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Engineering Officer Scott, Lieutenant McGivers."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Acknowledge.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","A strange, violent period in your history."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","I find no record what
so ever of an SS Botany Bay."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Captain, the DY-100 class vessel was
designed for interplanetary travel only."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","With simple nuclear-powered
engines, star travel was considered impractical at that time."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","It was
ten thousand to one against their making it to another star system."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",And why no record of the trip?
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","If you're suggesting this was a penal deportation vessel, you've
arrived at a totally illogical conclusion."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Your Earth was on the verge of a dark ages.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Whole populations
were being bombed out of existence."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","A group of criminals could have
been dealt with far more efficiently than wasting one of their most
advanced spaceships."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Even a theory requires some facts, Captain."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",So far I have none.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Irritation?
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",I am not capable of that emotion.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Insufficient facts always invites danger, Captain."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Aye, sir."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",I note he's making considerable use of our technical library.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","There is that possibility, Captain."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",His age would be correct.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","In
1993, a group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in
over forty nations."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Because the scientists overlooked one fact.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Superior ability
breeds superior ambition."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",I have collected some names and made some counts.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","By my
estimate, there were some eighty or ninety of these young supermen
unaccounted for when they were finally defeated."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Would you reveal to war-weary populations that some eighty
Napoleons might still be alive?"
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",And how you managed to keep it out of the history books.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",There was the war to end tyranny.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Many considered that a noble
effort."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Unify, sir?"
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Like a team of animals under one whip?
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Under dozens of petty dictatorships.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Then your sympathies were with
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","From 1992 through 1996, absolute ruler of more than a quarter of
your world."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",From Asia through the Middle East.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Gentlemen, this romanticism about a ruthless dictator is"
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",And as little freedom.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Gentlemen.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Illogical.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Turbo elevators inoperative.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Jammed, Captain."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Useless.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",They're on override in Engineering.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Impossible.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Intruder control systems inoperative.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Mister Khan
was very thorough in his study of our tech manuals."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Brilliant.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Every contingency anticipated.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Surprised to see you, Captain, though pleased."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Khan is holding our staff in the briefing room.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","His men have
control of the ship."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",There's a relay junction down the corridor.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Anesthesia gas in all sections except Engineering.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Someone
just closed that line."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Captain, acknowledge."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Unable to flood Engineering section.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",I suspect
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Negative.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","We must retake the vessel while the anesthesia
lasts."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Meet me in the Armoury.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",I'm blowing it clear first.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed",Spock out.
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Quite correct, Captain."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","Planet number five there is habitable,
although a bit savage, somewhat inhospitable."
SPOCK,"Space
Seed","It would be interesting, Captain, to return to that world in a
hundred years and to learn what crop has sprung from the seed you
planted today."
UHURA,"Space
Seed","I'm picking up a signal, sir."
UHURA,"Space
Seed","(a series of beeps comes over the
speakers) Captain, that's the old Morse code call signal."
UHURA,"Space
Seed",CQ.
UHURA,"Space
Seed",CQ.
UHURA,"Space
Seed","All decks acknowledging, sir."
UHURA,"Space
Seed","Go ahead, boarding party."
UHURA,"Space
Seed",We read you.
UHURA,"Space
Seed","Security alert, Captain."
UHURA,"Space
Seed","Communication channels are down,
Captain."
UHURA,"Space
Seed","All channels are totally jammed, Captain."
UHURA,"Space
Seed","Record tapes engaged and ready, Captain."
WEAPONS,"Space
Seed",Deflector shields on maximum.
WEAPONS,"Space
Seed","Phasers manned, sir."
MCCOY,"Space
Seed","Life science bioscanners are picking up heart beats from
over there."
MCCOY,"Space
Seed","Can't be human, though."
MCCOY,"Space
Seed","They're too faint, and average only
four beats per minute."
MCCOY,"Space
Seed","We're continuing to pick up some form of heart action over
there."
MCCOY,"Space
Seed","Very faint, very slow."
MCCOY,"Space
Seed","Seems to be coming from about sixty or
seventy bodies, as near as I can tell."
MCCOY,"Space
Seed",Could be.

MCCOY,"Space
Seed",No.
MCCOY,"Space
Seed","I signed aboard this ship to practice medicine, not to have
my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget."
MCCOY,"Space
Seed",It's theoretically possible.
MCCOY,"Space
Seed","I've never heard of it being tested
for this long a period."
MCCOY,"Space
Seed","Jim, I have a new reading."
MCCOY,"Space

mechanism."
MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

respiration beginning."
MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

pattern is firming up."
MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

his heart valve action has twice the power of yours and mine."
MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MCCOY,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space
Seed",I've seen old photographs of this.
MARLA,"Space
Seed","Necessary because of the time
involved in space travel until about the year 2018."
MARLA,"Space

to travel from one planet to another."
MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space
Seed","Captain, look here."
MARLA,"Space
Seed","(dragging herself back from just gazing at the man) Yes, sir."
MARLA,"Space
Seed",The leader was often set to revive first.
MARLA,"Space
Seed","This would allow him to
decide whether the conditions warranted revival of the others."
MARLA,"Space
Seed","From the northern India area, I'd guess."
MARLA,"Space
Seed",Probably a Sikh.
MARLA,"Space

were the most fantastic warriors."
MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space
Seed","Doctor, will he live?"
MARLA,"Space
Seed","I know, sir."
MARLA,"Space
Seed",I'm sorry.
MARLA,"Space
Seed","Not personally, Captain."
MARLA,"Space
Seed",Professionally.
MARLA,"Space
Seed","My profession is
historian, and when I find a specimen from the past alive, I'm in the
sheer delight of examining his mind."
MARLA,"Space
Seed","Yes, sir, I think they were."
MARLA,"Space
Seed","Yes, sir."
MARLA,"Space
Seed","Ship's historian, Lieutenant"
MARLA,"Space
Seed",Yes.
MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

purpose and"
MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

the past."
MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

you're going to like living in our time."
MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space

MARLA,"Space
Seed",Move away.
MARLA,"Space
Seed",No!
MARLA,"Space
Seed",Khan.
MARLA,"Space
Seed","There's no reason I must watch this, is there?"
MARLA,"Space
Seed",Khan said to watch him very closely.
MARLA,"Space
Seed","He may decide to
co-operate."
MARLA,"Space
Seed","Captain, I saved your life."
MARLA,"Space
Seed",Now please don't kill him.
MARLA,"Space

SCOTT,"Space

us."
SCOTT,"Space
Seed","We read heat coming on, complete oxygen atmosphere."
SCOTT,"Space

SCOTT,"Space

SCOTT,"Space

SCOTT,"Space

SCOTT,"Space

transistor units."
SCOTT,"Space
Seed",I'd love to tear this baby apart.
SCOTT,"Space
Seed",Beats me what's happening.
SCOTT,"Space
Seed",This one was probably programmed to be triggered first.
SCOTT,"Space
Seed","There's no change, and they're mixed types."
SCOTT,"Space
Seed","Western,
mid-European, Latin, Oriental."
SCOTT,"Space
Seed",Probably some dust.
SCOTT,"Space
Seed",It'd take an hour to figure it out.
SCOTT,"Space
Seed",Scott here.
SCOTT,"Space
Seed","Negative, Captain."
SCOTT,"Space
Seed","It appears they were in
suspended animation when the ship took off."
SCOTT,"Space
Seed","Twelve units have malfunctioned, leaving seventy two still
operating."
SCOTT,"Space
Seed",Thirty of those are women.
SCOTT,"Space
Seed","I must confess, gentlemen."
SCOTT,"Space
Seed","I've always held a sneaking
admiration for this one."
SCOTT,"Space

SCOTT,"Space

SCOTT,"Space

SCOTT,"Space

SCOTT,"Space

KHAN,"Space

KHAN,"Space
Seed",English.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I thought I dreamed hearing it.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Where am I?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Answer my question.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I like a brave man.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I remember a voice.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Did I hear it say I had been sleeping for two
centuries?"
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Where is your Captain?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I have many questions.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I see.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I have a few questions first.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",What is your heading?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",And my people?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",You will revive them.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I see.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Khan is my name.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Khan.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","I find myself growing fatigued, Doctor."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","May we continue this
questioning at some other time?"
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Captain, I wonder if I could have something to read during my
convalescence."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I was once an engineer of sorts.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","I would be most
interested in studying the technical manuals on your vessel."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Precisely.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Thank you, Captain."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",You are very co-operative.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Marla McGivers.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I am told you participated in my rebirth.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","I've been reading up on starships, but they have one luxury not
mentioned in the manuals."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",A beautiful woman.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",My name is Khan.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Please sit and entertain me.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",And why do you wear your hair in such an uncomplimentary fashion?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",But it's not attractive.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","(He takes her to a mirror and loosens a
couple of strands at the back.)"
KHAN,"Space
Seed",There.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Soft.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Natural.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Simple.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",You find no pleasure here?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",There.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Simple, soft."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Please remember.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I'm glad you came.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Please do it again.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Thank you.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I hoped you might guide me to our dinner engagement.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",(sees a picture on the wall) Very good.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Fine technique.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",And you've rearranged your hair for me.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Excellent.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",All bold men from the past.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Richard, Leif Ericson, Napoleon."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","A
hobby of yours, such men?"
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I am honoured.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Thank you.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",But I caution you.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Such men dare take
what they want."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Adventure, Captain."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Adventure.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","There was little else left on
Earth."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Tyranny, sir?"
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Or an attempt to unify humanity?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I know something of those years.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Remember, it was a time of great
dreams, of great aspiration."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",One man would have ruled eventually.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",As Rome under Caesar.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Think
of its accomplishments."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","You are an excellent tactician, Captain."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","You let your second in
command attack while you sit and watch for weakness."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","It has been said that social occasions are only warfare
concealed."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Many prefer it more honest, more open."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I've never been afraid.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",We offered the world order!
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Excellent.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Excellent.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","But if you will excuse me, gentlemen and
ladies, I grow fatigued again."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","With your permission, Captain, I will
return to my quarters."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Quite understandable, since I'm something of a mystery to them."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Do you?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Then I'll have to remold it to my liking.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Go.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Or stay.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",But do it because it is what you wish to do.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Well?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",How many minutes do you graciously offer?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",This grows tiresome.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",You must now ask to stay.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Open your heart.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Will you open your heart?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I intend to take this ship.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Do you agree?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I need your help.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Now you question me?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Will you assist me?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Leave me then.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Go, I say."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","I'm sorry, Captain."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I was lost in thought.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",My door.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Locked from
outside, a guard posted."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Excellent.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","You identified me with your computer system, I
imagine."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","A new life, a chance to build a world."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Other things I doubt you
would understand."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Captain, although your abilities intrigue me, you are quite
honestly inferior."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Mentally, physically."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","In fact, I am surprised how
little improvement there has been in human evolution."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Oh, there has
been technical advancement, but, how little man himself has changed."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Yes, it appears we will do well in your century, Captain."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Do you have
any other questions?"
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Otto.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Joaquin.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",The trip is over.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",The battle begins again.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Only
this time it's not a world we win."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",It's a universe.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Kati.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","He's not able to answer you at the moment,
Captain."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Your ship is mine.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","I have shut off the
life-support system to your Bridge, and jammed up your exit routes."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","I
am willing to negotiate."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Your air should be getting quite thin by now.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Do you surrender the Bridge?
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Academic, Captain."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Refuse,"
KHAN,"Space
Seed","And every person on the Bridge will
suffocate."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Nothing ever changes, except man."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Your technical accomplishments?
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Improve a mechanical device and you may double productivity.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","But
improve man and you gain a thousand fold."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I am such a man.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Join me.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I'll treat you well.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","I need your training to operate a vessel this
complex."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I see now I made one serious error.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","You are the Communications
Officer?"
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Engage the viewing screen, please."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","I should have realised that suffocating together on the Bridge
would create heroic camaraderie among you."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","But it is quite a different
thing to watch it happening to someone else."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Engage the viewing screen.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","I'm sure you recognise your medical decompression chamber here, Doctor."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",And the meaning of that indicator.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","(It is dropping to 10Hg) Your
Captain will die."
KHAN,"Space
Seed","If you join me, Mister Spock, I will save his life."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",My vessel was useless.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I need you and yours to select a colony planet.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",One with a population willing to be led by us.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Each of you in turn will go in there.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Die while the others watch.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",(Shakes his head) But I hoped you would be stronger.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","(She leaves)
If any one of you joins me, anyone!"
KHAN,"Space
Seed",I'll let him live.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",It's so useless!
KHAN,"Space
Seed",It does not matter.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",The Captain is dead.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Take Mister Spock next.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Armoury, this is Khan."
KHAN,"Space

KHAN,"Space

KHAN,"Space

KHAN,"Space

KHAN,"Space
Seed",Anyone.
KHAN,"Space
Seed",Report status.
KHAN,"Space

KHAN,"Space
Seed",Your ship flares up like an exploding sun within minutes.
KHAN,"Space

KHAN,"Space
Seed",You're no match for me.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","Have you ever read Milton, Captain?"
KHAN,"Space
Seed",(gazing into her eyes) It will be difficult.
KHAN,"Space
Seed","A struggle at first
even to stay alive, to find food."
KHAN,"Space
Seed",A superior woman.
KHAN,"Space

KHAN,"Space

I wanted."
KHAN,"Space

LAB TECH,"Space

KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Standard orbit, Mister Painter."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Yes, Lieutenant."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Maintain transmission pattern until we've established orbit.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Mister Spock, there were one hundred and fifty men, women, and children in that colony."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,What are the chances of survivors?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Are you saying that those people built a future in a place knowing they might not survive?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,And what about us?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Can we afford to send people to the planet's surface?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Thank you, Mister Painter."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Mister Spock, equip a landing party of five to accompany me to the planet's surface."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Include Doctor McCoy and a biologist.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I'll want them in ten minutes.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Another dream that failed.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,There's nothing sadder.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,It took these people a year to make the trip from Earth.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,They came all that way and died.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Actually, Mister Sandoval, we didn't come here because of your silent radio."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,But these people shouldn't be alive.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Gentlemen, we're debating in a vacuum."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Let's go get some answers.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,What was the reason for the dispersal?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Mister Sandoval, we do have a mission here."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Examinations, tests."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,We'll try not to interfere with your work.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Anything?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Kirk here.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Sulu had the same observation.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Any explanations?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Very well.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Continue investigations.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Kirk out.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Yes, especially in view of the fact that the records for this expedition indicate that they did have some for breeding and food purposes."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Apparently, none of them survived."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Yes, I thought you might."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,He promised to throw away his shingle.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Go ahead, Lieutenant."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Make your point.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,It's like a jigsaw puzzle all one colour.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,No key to where the pieces fit in.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Why?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Kirk here.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Trouble?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,On my way.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,What's so strange about that?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Instrument malfunction?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Mister Sandoval, within the hour I've received orders from Starfleet Command to evacuate all personnel from this colony."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Naturally, you'll inform your people to begin preparations."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,We will have accommodations for you aboard the Enterprise.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,It's not an arbitrary decision on my part.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I have my orders.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,What about your animals?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"That doesn't answer my question, sir."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Why did all your animals die?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Sandoval.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,You're being unreasonable.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Excuse me.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,My orders are to remove all the colonists.

KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Where are you?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Spock, I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is an order."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Report back to me at the settlement in ten minutes.

KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"You don't think so, what?"
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Spock, report to me immediately."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Spock?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Acknowledge.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Spock.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"The frequency is open, but he doesn't answer."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,No.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I thought you said you might like him if he mellowed a little.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,You said that.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Yes, take over the landing party detail and start getting those colonists aboard."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,The frequency is open.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,It'll act as a homing device.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Contact DeSalle.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Have him meet you here.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Make sure the landing party work in teams of two.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I don't want anybody left alone down here.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Spock.

KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Mister Spock.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Are you out of your mind?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,You were told to report to me at once.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,You?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Yes, I can see that."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Miss Kalomi, you'll have to come back to the settlement and prepare to transport up to the ship."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Mister Sulu, Mister Spock is under arrest, and he's in your custody until we get back to the Enterprise."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,What's?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"I don't know what these plants are or how they work, but you're all going back to the settlement with me, and those colonists are going aboard the ship."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,How many of those did you beam up?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,This is the Captain.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Beam me up.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I most certainly do.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Energise.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Lieutenant, put me through to Admiral Komack at Starfleet."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"What do you mean, you can't do that."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Follow standard procedure.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,That's an order.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Out?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Get back to your stations.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Get back to your stations.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I said get back to your station.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"This is mutiny, mister."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I've heard that word a lot lately.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Perfect.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Everything's perfect.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I'll bet you've even grown your tonsils back.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Look, Bones, I need your help."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Can you run tests, blood samples, anything at all to give us a lead on what these things are, how to counteract them?"
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Bones.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Bones.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Where's McCoy?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,In your own private paradise.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Where did they originate?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,That's paradise?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,No wants.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,No needs.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,We weren't meant for that.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,None of us.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Man stagnates if he has no ambition, no desire to be more than he is."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Except a challenge.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I'm going back to the ship.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Engineering?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Scotty?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Biochemistry lab?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Security?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Is there anyone on board?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,This is the Captain.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Captain's log, stardate 3417.7."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Except for myself, all crew personnel have transported to the surface of the planet."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Mutinied.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Lieutenant Uhura has effectively sabotaged the communications station.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I can only contact the surface of the planet.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"The ship can be maintained in orbit for several months, but even with automatic controls, I cannot pilot her alone."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"In effect, I am marooned here."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"I'm beginning to realise just how big this ship really is, how quiet."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"I don't know how to get my crew back, how to counteract the effect of the spores."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I don't know what I can offer against paradise.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Enterprise to Mister Spock.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I've joined you.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I understand now.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,There are some things in my quarters I want to pack.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Kirk out.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,No.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,No!
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I can't leave!
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,(he's very relieved) Emotions.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Violent emotions.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Needs.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Anger.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Captain's log, supplemental."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"I think I've discovered the answer, but to carry out my plan entails considerable risk."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Mister Spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Aroused, his great physical strength could kill."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,But it's a risk I'll have to take.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Enterprise to Mister Spock.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,It's Jim.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"I've been packing some things, and I realise there's some equipment here that we should have down at the settlement."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,You know we can't come back on board once the last of us has left.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"No, I think you and I can handle it."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Why don't you beam up now?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,(with a large metal bar in his hand) Energising.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"All right, you mutinous, disloyal, computerised, half-breed, we'll see about you deserting my ship."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,What makes you think you're a man?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"You're an overgrown jackrabbit, an elf with a hyperactive thyroid."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Of course you don't understand.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,You don't have the brains to understand.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,All you have is printed circuits.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"What can you expect from a simpering, devil-eared freak whose father was a computer and his mother an encyclopedia?"
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Your father was a computer, like his son."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,An ambassador from a planet of traitors.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,A Vulcan never lived who had an ounce of integrity.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,You're a traitor from a race of traitors.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Disloyal to the core, rotten like the rest of your subhuman race, and you've got the gall to make love to that girl."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Does she know what she's getting, Spock?"
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"A carcass full of memory banks who should be squatting in a mushroom, instead of passing himself off as a man?"
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"You belong in a circus, Spock, not a starship."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Right next to the dog-faced boy.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Had enough?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I didn't realise what it took to get under that thick hide of yours.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Anyhow, I don't know what you're so mad about."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,It isn't every first officer who gets to belt his Captain several times.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Believe me, Mister Spock, it was painful in more ways than one."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,You said they were benevolent and peaceful.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Violent emotions overwhelm them, destroy them."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I had to make you angry enough to shake off their influence.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"That's the answer, Mister Spock."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,I had something else in mind.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Can you put together a subsonic transmitter.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Something we can hook into the communications station and broadcast over the communicator?
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Good.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Let's get to work.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Well, if we're both in the Brig, who's going to build the subsonic transmitter?"
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Mister Spock, Miss Kalomi is strictly your concern, but should you talk to her while she's still under the influence of the spores?"
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,The Captain discovered that strong emotions and needs destroy the spore influence.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,As though somebody had put itching powder on their skin.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Put him on the speaker.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Kirk here.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Start making preparations, Mister Sandoval."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,We'll begin transporting your people aboard as soon as more of our crew checks in.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Good.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"No, no, Bones."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,This time we walked out on our own.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Maybe we weren't meant for paradise.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Maybe we were meant to fight our way through.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"Struggle, claw our way up, scratch for every inch of the way."
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,Maybe we can't stroll to the music of the lute.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,We must march to the sound of drums.
KIRK,This Side of Paradise,"We haven't heard much from you about Omicron Ceti Three, Mister Spock."
UHURA,This Side of Paradise,Captain.
UHURA,This Side of Paradise,I've been transmitting a contact signal every five minutes.
UHURA,This Side of Paradise,All I get is dead air.
UHURA,This Side of Paradise,Shall I continue?
UHURA,This Side of Paradise,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,This Side of Paradise,"Oh, I'm sorry, Captain."
UHURA,This Side of Paradise,I can't do that.
UHURA,This Side of Paradise,"Oh, I know it is, Captain, but you see, all communications are out."
UHURA,This Side of Paradise,"I short-circuited them, except ship to surface."
UHURA,This Side of Paradise,We'll need that for a while.
UHURA,This Side of Paradise,"It's really for the best, Captain."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Absolutely none, Captain."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Berthold rays are such a recent discovery.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,We do not yet have full knowledge of their nature.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"It is known, however, that living animal tissue disintegrates under exposure."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Sandoval's group could not have survived after three years.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,I am saying they knew there was a risk.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,The breakdown of tissue does not develop immediately.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,We can risk a limited exposure.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Captain, this planet is being bombarded by Berthold rays, as our reports indicated."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"At this intensity, we'll be safe for a week if necessary."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,But
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,There's also no question of the fact that Berthold rays are incontrovertibly deadly.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"There's no miracle connected with it, Doctor, you know that."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"No cures, no serums, no antidotes."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"If a man is exposed long enough, he dies."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"There seems to be a total absence of life on the planet, with the exception of the colonists and various types of flora."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Not at the moment, sir."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"I am conducting various tests with the tricorder, but results are inconclusive."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Nothing.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Not even insects.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Yet your plants grow, and you've survived exposure to Berthold rays."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Please do.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,I have never understood the female capacity to avoid a direct answer to any question.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,I would like to know how your people have managed to survive here.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Logically, you should all be dead."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Emotions are alien to me.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,I'm a scientist.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,You've not yet explained the nature of this thing.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,What you're describing was once known in the vernacular as a happiness pill.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"And you, as a scientist, should know that that's not possible."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Spores?
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,No.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"No, I can't."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Please, don't!"
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,I am not like you.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,I love you.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,I can love you.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,That one looks like a dragon.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,You see the tail and the dorsal spines?
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,I have.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,On Berengaria Seven.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,But I've never stopped to look at clouds before.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Or rainbows.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"You know, I can tell you exactly why one appears in the sky, but considering its beauty has always been out of the question."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Yes, what did you want?"
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,What did you want?
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,I don't believe I want to tell you.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"No, I don't think so."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"I don't think so, sir."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"I didn't want to, Jim."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"There'll be no evacuation, Jim, but perhaps we should go back and get you straightened out."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Very well.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Come with me.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Mister Sulu understands, don't you, Mister Sulu?"
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,I can see the Captain is going to be difficult.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Almost the entire ship's complement has beamed down.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,He went off to create something called a mint julep.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"That's a drink, Jim."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,It's impossible to say.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,They drifted through space until they finally landed here.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"You see, they actually thrive on Berthold rays."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,The plants act as a repository for thousands of microscopic spores until they find a human body to inhabit.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"It's a true Eden, Jim."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,There's belonging and love.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"You don't understand, Jim, but you'll come around sooner or later."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Join us.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Please.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Yes, Jim."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,What is it now?
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Wonderful, Jim."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,When will you beam down?
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Good.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Leila and I will meet you at the beam down point.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Spock here.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"What's keeping you, Jim?"
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,We've been waiting.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Do you want me to beam up a party?
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Just a moment.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,It won't take long.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Do you mind?
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Ready to beam up, Jim."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"The term half-breed is somewhat applicable, but computerised is inaccurate."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"A machine can be computerised, not a man."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Jim, I don't understand."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Captain, if you'll excuse me."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,My mother was a teacher.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,My father an ambassador.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Captain, please don't"
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,That's enough.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,You did that to me deliberately.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,The spores.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,They're gone.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,I don't belong anymore.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"That may be correct, Captain, but trying to initiate a brawl with over five hundred crewmen and colonists is hardly logical."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,It can be done.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Captain.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Striking a fellow officer is a court martial offence.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"That is quite logical, Captain."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Enterprise.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Spock here.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Yes.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Yes.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,I'm quite well.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Are you still at the beam down point, and is the doctor there?"
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Give your communicator back to Doctor McCoy.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,You won't need it to beam up.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,It'll take a few moments.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Just wait there.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Out.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"I'll be back shortly, Captain."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,It was necessary.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,I can't.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"I have a responsibility to this ship, to that man on the Bridge."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"I am what I am, Leila, and if there are self-made purgatories, then we all have to live in them."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Mine can be no worse than someone else's.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,(wiping away her tears) You couldn't pronounce it.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"They'll not hear this, of course."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,It'll be more a sensation of feeling it.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Precisely.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,It should begin to work on their nerves in a few minutes.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Enterprise.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Spock here.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Just a moment.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"They're all beginning to call in, Captain."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Rather contritely, I should say."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Sandoval wishes to speak to you.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"Poetry, Captain."
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,Non-regulation.
SPOCK,This Side of Paradise,"I have little to say about it, Captain, except that for the first time in my life I was happy."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Hardly that, sir."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,Welcome to Omicron Ceti Three.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,I'm Elias Sandoval.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We haven't seen anyone outside our group for four years since we left Earth.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We've been expecting someone for some time.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Our subspace radio didn't work properly, and I'm afraid we didn't have anyone who could master its intricacies."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"It makes little difference, Captain."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,You're here.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We're happy to see you.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Come, let me show you our settlement."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"There are two other settlements, but we have forty five colonists here."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We felt three groups would have better potential.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"If disease were to strike one group, the others would be less likely to be affected."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"You see, Omicron is an ideal agricultural planet."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We determined not to suffer the fate of expeditions that went before us.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Leila, come meet our guests."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"This is Leila Kalomi, our botanist."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"This is Captain Kirk, Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"By all means, make them."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,I think you'll find our settlement an interesting one.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Our philosophy is a simple one, that men should return to a less complicated life."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We have few mechanical things here.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"No vehicles, no weapons."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We have harmony here.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,Complete peace.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Make yourselves at home, gentlemen."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,You've known the Vulcanian?
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,Did you love him?
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,How did he feel?
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Would you like him to stay with us now, to be as one of us?"
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Captain, I've been looking for you."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,You haven't seen our fields and crops.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,I'd like to show you and the Doctor what we've accomplished here.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,You'll find no weaklings here.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,Captain.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"This is the reason, Captain."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,This soil will grow anything we plant in it.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,It's a perfect world.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"We have a moderate climate, moderate rains all year round."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,It gives us all we need.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,It is perfect.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"I have work to attend to myself, Captain."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,No.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Captain, it's entirely unnecessary."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We're in no danger here.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Doctor, how can I make you understand?"
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,Your own instruments have shown that we're all in perfect health.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We've had no deaths here.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We're vegetarians.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Captain, you stress very unimportant matters."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We will not leave.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Captain, your arguments are very valid, but they do not apply to us."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Well, nevertheless."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,Excuse me.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,I'm very pleased.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,The entire landing operation is proceeding quite well.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Captain, why don't you join us?"
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,The spores have made it that.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"In return, they give you complete health and peace of mind."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"We have no need or want, Captain."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We have what we need.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Well, Doctor, I've been thinking about what sort of work I could assign you to."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Not any more, of course."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We don't need you.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,Not as a doctor.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,I am the leader of this colony.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,I'll assign you whatever work I think suitable.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We've done nothing here.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"No accomplishments, no progress."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,Three years wasted.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We wanted to make this planet a garden.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"I think I'd, I think we'd like to get some work done."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,The work we started out to do.
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,"Oh, Captain, as I understood it, you were to transport us to Starbase Twenty Seven."
ELIAS,This Side of Paradise,We'll give you every co-operation.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"On pure speculation, just an educated guess, I'd say that man is alive."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"You shook hands with him, Jim."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,His flesh was warm.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,He's alive.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,There's no doubt about that.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,That'll be all.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Thank you very much.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"I've examined nine men so far, varying in ages from twenty three to fifty nine."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,They're all in perfect condition.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Text book responses.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Heart, lungs, excellent."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Co-ordination, excellent."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Reflexes, excellent."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"If there are many more of them, I could throw away my shingle."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,No animals.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,That's peculiar.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,I'd like to see the medical records on the expedition.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,I'm afraid I'll have to bow out.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,I have to continue with these medical examinations.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"However, if I find everyone else's health to be as perfect as yours, I"
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"This is McCoy, Jim."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,I think you'd better get back here.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"No, but I'd like you to see this for yourself."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Sandoval's medical record, four years ago when the expedition left Earth."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,He registered scar tissue on his lungs from lobar pneumonia suffered when he was a child.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"No major operations, but there was an appendectomy."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Received all required inoculations, et cetera."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Nothing, but I examined that man no more than two hours ago."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,You know what his readings were?
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Perfect, perfect, and perfect."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Just like everyone else I've examined here.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,No.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,I thought of that and tested it on myself.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,It accurately recorded my lack of tonsils and those two broken ribs I had once.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"It did not record the scar tissue on Sandoval's lungs, but it did record a healthy appendix where one was supposedly removed."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,We've explained the Berthold rays to you and their effect.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Can't you understand?
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Would you like to use a butterfly net on him, Captain?"
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,DeSalle said he was going to examine some native plants he found.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Did Spock call in at all?
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"That didn't sound at all like Spock, Jim."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,I didn't say that.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Not exactly.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,He might be in trouble.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,How will you find Spock?
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"What are you doing with those things, DeSalle?"
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"(No equipment or colonists now, just plants going up to the ship.)"
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,(with an extreme southern drawl) Ready to beam up.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Hiya, Jimmy boy!"
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Hey, I've taken care of everything."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,All y'all gotta do is relax.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Doctor's orders.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Oh, must be nigh onto a hundred by now."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"I'm not interested in any physical-psychological aspects, Jim boy."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,We all perfectly healthy down here.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Yeah.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,That's right.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,That's just what it is.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Sho'nuf.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Hey, Jim boy, y'all ever have a real cold Georgia-style mint julep, huh?"
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Who wants to counteract paradise, Jim boy?"
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,McCoy out.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Well now, it's a little early to be counting stars, Miss Leila."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Well, now, I think I can fix that for you."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Enterprise?
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"What do you mean, what sort of work?"
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,I'm a doctor.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Oh, no?"
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Would you like to see how fast I can put you in a hospital?
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Just a minute.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,You'd better make me a mechanic.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Then I can treat little tin gods like you.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"(He punches Elias) Sorry, Sandoval."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,I don't know what made me do that.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,You can't stay here.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,You can't survive without the spores.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"After you've cleared at the Starbase, you could be relocated."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,It depends upon what you want.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Enterprise.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,This is McCoy.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,Sandoval would like to talk to the Captain.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Well, Jim, I've just examined the last of the colonists, and they're all in absolutely perfect, perfect health."
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,A fringe benefit left over by the spores.
MCCOY,This Side of Paradise,"Well, that's the second time man's been thrown out of paradise."
SULU,This Side of Paradise,Is it possible that they're not?
SULU,This Side of Paradise,"Whatever doesn't look right, whatever that is."
SULU,This Side of Paradise,"When it comes to farms, I wouldn't know what looked right or wrong if it were two feet from me."
SULU,This Side of Paradise,What is it?
SULU,This Side of Paradise,"Come to think of it, we haven't seen any animals."
SULU,This Side of Paradise,"No horses, no pigs, not even a dog."
SULU,This Side of Paradise,Nothing.
SULU,This Side of Paradise,"Captain, we've checked out everything."
SULU,This Side of Paradise,"It all seems normal, except for the absence of any animals."
SULU,This Side of Paradise,We haven't seen them since we began our check.
SULU,This Side of Paradise,"Yes, sir."
SULU,This Side of Paradise,"Yes, I see now."
SULU,This Side of Paradise,Of course we can't remove the colony.
SULU,This Side of Paradise,It'd be wrong.
SULU,This Side of Paradise,"[Field]  Sorry, DeSalle."
SULU,This Side of Paradise,I said I was sorry.
SULU,This Side of Paradise,If you hadn't gotten in my way
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Elias.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Mister Spock and I have met before.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,It's been a long time.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"On Earth, six years ago."
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"If I did, it was important only to myself."
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Mister Spock's feelings were never expressed to me.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,It is said he has none to give.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"There is no choice, Elias."
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,He will stay.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,That can be explained.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Later.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,And I never understood you.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Until now.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,There was always a place in here where no one could come.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,There was only the face you allow people to see.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Only one side you'd allow them to know.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,I missed you.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"If I tell you how we survived, will you try to understand how we feel about our life here?"
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,About each other?
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Someone else might believe that.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"Your shipmates, your Captain, but not me."
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Come.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,It's not much further.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Its basic properties and elements are not important.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"What is important is it gives life, peace, love."
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Come.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,I was one of the first to find them.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,The spores.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,It shouldn't hurt.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Not like this.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,It didn't hurt us.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Now.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"Now, you belong to all of us and we to you."
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,There's no need to hide your inner face any longer.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,We understand.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,I've never seen a dragon.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Not here.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,I'll wait.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,I'm waiting for Mister Spock and the Captain to transport down.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,They had some equipment to be moved.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,But it's been so long.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,I wish he'd come back.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,This is Leila.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,I borrowed the doctor's communicator.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,I was worried something might have happened to you.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"You are all right, aren't you?"
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Can I come aboard?
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,I've never seen a starship before
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,and I want to talk to you.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Yes to both questions.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"You're no longer with us, are you?"
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,I felt something was wrong.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Come back to the planet with me.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,You can belong again.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"Come back with me, please."
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,I love you.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"I said that six years ago, and I can't seem to stop repeating myself."
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"On Earth, you couldn't give anything of yourself."
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,You couldn't even put your arms around me.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,We couldn't have anything together there.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,We couldn't have anything together anyplace else.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,We're happy here.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"(crying) I can't lose you now, Mister Spock."
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,I can't.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"I have lost you, haven't I?"
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"And not only you, I've lost all of it."
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,The spores.
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"I've lost them, too."
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,And this is for my good?
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,Do you mind if I say I still love you?
LEILA,This Side of Paradise,"You never told me if you had another name, Mister Spock."
KELOWITZ,This Side of Paradise,"What exactly are we looking for anyway, sir?"
KELOWITZ,This Side of Paradise,(opening up the barn door) Hey.
KELOWITZ,This Side of Paradise,No cows.
KELOWITZ,This Side of Paradise,"This barn isn't even built for them, Just for storage."
KELOWITZ,This Side of Paradise,Come on.
KELOWITZ,This Side of Paradise,Break it up.
KELOWITZ,This Side of Paradise,Break it up.
LESLIE,This Side of Paradise,"Pardon me, Captain."
LESLIE,This Side of Paradise,"Biology report ready, sir."
LESLIE,This Side of Paradise,I heard Sandoval saying they could grow anything here.
LESLIE,This Side of Paradise,"That's true, sir."
LESLIE,This Side of Paradise,They've got a variety of crops in.
LESLIE,This Side of Paradise,"Grains, potatoes, beans."
LESLIE,This Side of Paradise,"Well, sir, for an agricultural colony, they have actually very little acreage planted."
LESLIE,This Side of Paradise,"There's enough to sustain the colony, but very little more."
DESALLE,This Side of Paradise,"I want you to take a close look at these, Doc."
DESALLE,This Side of Paradise,They're very interesting.
DESALLE,This Side of Paradise,What do you think you're doing?
DESALLE,This Side of Paradise,More like you're clumsy.
CHIEF,This Side of Paradise,"Hey, Doc, I'm ready to energise."
CHIEF,This Side of Paradise,Everything okay with those plants?
CHIEF,This Side of Paradise,"Well, sure, if you want."
CREWMAN,This Side of Paradise,"I'm sorry, sir."
CREWMAN,This Side of Paradise,We're all transporting down to join the colony.
CREWMAN,This Side of Paradise,"No, sir."
CREWMAN,This Side of Paradise,"Yes, sir."
CREWMAN,This Side of Paradise,It is.
SAM,"The
Devil In The Dark",Who's there?
SAM,"The
Devil In The Dark","Didn't see a thing, Chief."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","(enters with a lot of men) It's your relief, Sam."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","All
quiet?"
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Stay on your toes, Schmitter."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Keep your phaser in your hand
at all times."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","I'm sorry, Schmitter."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","I know how you feel, but we've got to
have guards."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Keep alert.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","If you hear anything or see anything, call in."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Somebody can arrive in three minutes.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's coming.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",You'll be all right.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Come on.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Schmitter.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Like the rest of them.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Burned to a crisp.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","About three months ago, we opened up a new level."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Sensors
gave us an unusually rich pergium reading."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Not only pergium, whatever
you want."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Uranium, sirium, platinum."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",The whole planet's like that.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","It's
a treasure house."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","First, the automatic machinery, piece by piece, started to
almost disintegrate."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Metal began dissolving away.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","There was no reason
for it, and our chemists were unable to analyse the corrosive agent."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, it has."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","I don't know what this butchering monster is,
but I know what it's doing."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Our maintenance engineers sent down to the
drifts to repair the corroded machinery."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","We found them seared to a
crisp."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",He's right.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",None.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","At first the deaths were down deep, but
they've been moving up toward our levels."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","The last man died two days
ago three levels below this."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",We kept it for you.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",There isn't much left.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Roberts will
show you."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",(McCoy and the guard leave) It isn't pretty.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Of course.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Five of them have died.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","This is Ed Appel, chief processing engineer."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Ed shot it.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",You'll get it.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's a silicon nodule.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","There are a millions of them are
down there."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",No commercial value.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",A few trace elements.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Look, we didn't call you here so you
could collect rocks."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",You'll have it.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Just find that creature, whatever it is."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",I've got a quota to meet.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Come on, Appel."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",(reentering) They were made last year.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",That's right.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","When that creature appears, men die."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Something's happening in the reactor room!
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Back to your stations.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Look at that.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Kirk, quickly!"
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",The main circulating pump for the entire reactor is gone.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","No, none."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","It's outdated, but we never had any trouble with
it."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Without the pump mechanism, the reactor will go
supercritical."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",It could poison half the planet.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",We can't shut it down.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","It provides heat and air and life support for
the whole colony."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",What happens when it breaks down?
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Hopefully.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Small chance.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","I'm concerned with my people right here, Kirk."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","They're
being murdered."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",You find that monster and kill it.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Except the bloody thing.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",The twenty-third.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Why?
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","I don't know any safe place, Captain, the way that thing
comes and goes."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Not all of them, Captain."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","I and some of
my key personnel are staying."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",We'll be down to join you.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Then we'll use clubs.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","We're not being
chased away from here."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",We're staying.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Come on.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",That thing has killed fifty of my men.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",What?
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",We didn't know.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",How could we?
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","You mean if these eggs hatch,
there'll be thousands of those things crawling around down here?"
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Sounds all right, if it will work."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Just wanted to tell you the eggs have
started to hatch, Captain."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","First thing the little devils do
is start to tunnel."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","We've already hit huge new pergium
deposits."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","I'm afraid to tell you how much gold and platinum and rare
earths we've uncovered."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","You know, the Horta aren't so bad once you're used to
their appearance."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark",Well.
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","that's about it, Kirk."
VANDERBERG,"The
Devil In The Dark","Thanks for
everything."
SCHMITTER,"The
Devil In The Dark",Nobody ever does.
SCHMITTER,"The
Devil In The Dark","Whatever the thing is, it's already killed
fifty people."
SCHMITTER,"The
Devil In The Dark",I never realised before how dark it is down here.
SCHMITTER,"The
Devil In The Dark",What good will that do?
SCHMITTER,"The
Devil In The Dark","You saw what happened to Ed Appel
when he shot at it."
SCHMITTER,"The
Devil In The Dark","How about those other people before the monster got
them?"
SCHMITTER,"The
Devil In The Dark","Okay, Chief."
SCHMITTER,"The
Devil In The Dark",I'll do what I can.
SCHMITTER,"The
Devil In The Dark",A lot can happen in three minutes.
SCHMITTER,"The
Devil In The Dark","Chief, is it true the
Enterprise is on its way?"
SCHMITTER,"The
Devil In The Dark",You think it could get here in the next four hours?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","All right, let's assume there is a monster."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",What has it done?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",When did it start?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, we're aware of that."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","If mining conditions weren't so
difficult, Janus Six could supply the mineral needs of a thousand
planets."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",But what happened?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Volcanic activity?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Same way?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Burned?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Do you post sentries?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Guards?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Who else has seen this?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Describe it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","That's why we're here, Mister Vanderberg."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I don't think we'll need to, Mister Appel."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister Vanderberg,
we'll need a complete subsurface chart of all the drifts, galleries and
tunnels."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Thank you, Mister Vanderberg."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","We'll need your complete
co-operation."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",The vast number of tunnels won't make our hunting any easier.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Doc?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Explain.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Strong enough to eat machinery?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister Vanderberg, how recent are these charts?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Before the appearance of whatever it is?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I see.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Mister Spock give us a report on life beneath the surface.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",We can't cover tunnel by tunnel on foot.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","We must get production
going again."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",We must have that pergium.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Too many tunnels.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",We couldn't possibly.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister Spock, our sensors
can pick up normal life functions at a considerable distance, but what
about abnormal life functions?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Is there a replacement for that?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Spock, on board?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister Spock, we seem to have been given a choice."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Death by
asphyxiation or death by radiation poisoning."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Can you rig one up?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's vital.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",How long?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Forty eight hours is better than nothing.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Gather what you need
and beam down here with it."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Top priority.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Hopefully we'll have found the missing part by then.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","We'll have to, Chief."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The alternative is to evacuate all you
people up to the Enterprise."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","A dozen planets depend on you for pergium
for their reactor."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",They're already screaming.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Reactors closing down,
life support systems"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Do you think the creature is trying to push the colonists off the
planet?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","But why now, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","These production facilities have been
in operation for over fifty years."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",What's that?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Not necessarily, Bones."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I've heard of the theoretical possibility
of life based on silicon."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","A silicon-based life would be of an entirely
different order."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's possible that our phasers might not affect it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","All right, how about this?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","A creature that lives deep in the
planet below us, at home in solid rock."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","It seems to me that in order to
survive, it would have to have some form of natural armour plating."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",But our people have phaser number two.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","You may be right, Doctor, but at least it's something to go on."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister Spock, have Lieutenant Commander Giotto assemble the security
troops and arm them with phaser number two."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","You make the proper
adjustments."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",You seem fascinated by this rock.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Do they tie in?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Speculate.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","A short time, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",We have very little.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","How's it going, Scotty?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It has to hold longer than a bit.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",(answers comm.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",beep) Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I'll be right there.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Kirk out.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Scotty, ride herd on it."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Kind
words."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Tender, loving care."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Kiss it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Baby it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Flatter it if you have
to, but keep it going."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","You will proceed from level to level, checking out every foot,
every opening."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","You are searching for some sort of creature which is
highly resistant to phaser fire."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Phasers will be set on maximum, and
remember this."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Fifty people have died.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I want no more deaths.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",The creature may or may not attack on sight.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","However, you must."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It is vitally important we get this installation back into production.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's one of the possibilities we've discussed.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","(to Vanderberg) I
want your people to stay on the top level, together at a safe place."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Well, gentlemen, you have your instructions."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Let's get at it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Mister Spock?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Find something?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Traces?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",One of our people?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Come on.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's only been seconds since we heard him scream.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The creature
must still be around."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Are you certain?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",This tunnel goes back as far as the eye can see.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Our best
machinery couldn't cut a tunnel like this, not even with phasers."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Gone.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",These walls are hot.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, perfectly."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, we saw it."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Where does the tunnel go?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Yes.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",We took a bite out of it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's not animal tissue.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",What is it?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Then your guess was right.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Summation.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",That would account for the tunnels.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Powerful enough to dissolve the door of the reactor chamber.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's definitely phaser resistant.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","We had our weapons set for
silicon and on full power, yet we only damaged it."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It still lives.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",No.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","No, it might require amassed phasers."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Commander, pass this on to your men We knew it was a killer."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Now
it's wounded, probably in pain somewhere back there."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Commander Giotto,
instruct your men to concentrate the search in this sector."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Remind them
the creature is wounded."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","What is it, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",One creature in a hundred miles?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Then we're dealing with more than one creature, despite your
tricorder readings, or we have a creature with an extremely long life
span."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister Spock, our mission is to protect this colony, to get the
pergium moving again."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",This is not a zoological expedition.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Maintain a
constant reading on the creature."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","If we have to, we'll use phasers to
cut our own tunnels."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",We'll try to surround it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I'm sorry, Mister Spock,
but I'm afraid the creature must die."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Good.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","So it is wounded, and therefore twice as dangerous."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Stay in
pairs."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","If you see it, concentrate your phaser fire at what appears to
be its head."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Concentrate it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Maintain it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","It is definitely resistant,
but it can be hurt."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","And if it can be hurt, it can be killed."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister
Spock."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Your orders are shoot to kill.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Protect yourself at all times.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Commander Giotto, disperse your search parties."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Capture it?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I don't recall giving any such order.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I will lose no more men.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The creature will be killed on sight and
that's the end of it."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I want you to assist Scotty in maintaining that
makeshift circulating pump."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",You heard me.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's vital that we keep that reactor in operation.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Your scientific knowledge
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister Spock, you are second in command."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","This will be a dangerous
hunt."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Either one of us by himself is expendable.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Both of us are not.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","2,228.7 to 1?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Those are pretty good odds, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Of course.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Well, I hate to use the word, but logically, with
those kind of odds, you might as well stay."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","But please stay out of
trouble, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Can you fix it again?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Start immediate evacuation of all colonists
to the Enterprise."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",We haven't enough phasers for you.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Good.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Get everybody else aboard the
Enterprise."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The fewer people we have breathing the air down here, the
longer the rest of us will be able to hold out."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","How much longer,
Scotty?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",We'll do our best.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Start feeding us constant
status reports, Scotty."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Vanderberg, you and your crew assemble at level
twenty three, checkpoint Tiger."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Kirk out.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Team up with the Enterprise security personnel.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","They're better
armed than you."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Keep someone in sight at all times.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Vanderberg, take
two men."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Go through that tunnel there.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Rendezvous with Commander
Giotto."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Appel and the rest of the men, go through there and tie up with
Lieutenant Osborne's detail."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister Spock and I will control the
operation from a central point."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",That's all.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Mister Spock?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Are you sure?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Intuition?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The chart says both of these tunnels converge a few thousand
yards further."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",You take the left.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I'll take the right.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Two tunnels, two of us."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",We separate.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I've found a whole layer of these silicon
nodules of yours, hundreds of them."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Explain.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, Mister Spock, I'm all right."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","We seem to
have had a cave-in."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",No.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","No, no, you'd better not."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Any disturbance might bring
down the rest of the wall."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Besides, it isn't necessary."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The chart said
the tunnels meet further on."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Very well, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I'll meet you at the
other end."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","(Just then a part of the wall vanishes, and their strange adversary
emerges."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The pair have a stand off, with the creature approaching when
Kirk lowers his phaser, and backing off when he raises it."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The
communicator beeps.)"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","It's not necessary, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I know exactly where the
creature is."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Ten feet away from me.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","It's not making any threatening moves, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I thought you were the one who wanted it kept alive, captured if
possible."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It seems to be waiting.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","(sitting down) Well, what do we do, just talk
it over?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Well, you can be hurt, can't you?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",We just sit here?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","It's your
move."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","No, no!"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Don't shoot.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Come on over, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",No.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It seems to be waiting.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I tried talking to it, but it didn't
do any good."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, they're all through here, all over the place."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Thousands of
them."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Does it means something to you?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",You think you can get through to that thing?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister Spock, I know it's a terrible personal lowering of mental
barriers but if there's a chance"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",No kill I.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","What is that, a plea for us not to kill it, or a
promise that it won't kill us?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",A Horta.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",A Horta!
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister Spock, we need that retardation
mechanism."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",You must re-establish communications with it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, I'm aware of that."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",If we could only win its confidence.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Doctor McCoy, this is Captain Kirk."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Grab your medical kit and come down here on the double.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I've got
a patient for you."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Never mind.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Just come down to the twenty third level.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","You'll be
led to us by tricorder readings."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Kirk out.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","He's a healer, let him heal."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister Spock, you must re-establish
communications."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I want to know why it suddenly took to murder.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",We've seen how the creature destroys.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Lieutenant Commander Giotto.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Perfectly all right.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Where are you?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Under no circumstances allow them in here
yet."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The minute Doc McCoy gets there, send him through."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's wounded.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Badly.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",You've got to help it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Go take a look.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Help it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Treat it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",You're a healer.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",There's a patient.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",That's an order.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister
Spock."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Tell it we're trying to help.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",The mechanism.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Spock.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Spock!
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Come out of it.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I found
the unit in there."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's in pretty good shape.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I also found about a
million of these silicon nodules."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","They're eggs, aren't they?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The miners must
have broken into the hatchery."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Their operations destroyed thousands of
them."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",No wonder.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","How are you doing, Doc?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Don't fire.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",First man that fires is dead.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",You've killed thousands of her children.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Those round silicon nodules that you've been collecting and
destroying?"
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",They're her eggs.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Tell them, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The Horta is intelligent, peaceful, mild."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","She had no objection to
sharing this planet with you, till you broke into her nursery and
started destroying her eggs."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Then she fought back in the only way she
knew how, as any mother would fight when her children are in danger."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",This is where they live.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","They digest rock, they tunnel for
nourishment."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, I know."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Here's your circulating pump.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","You've complained this
planet is a mineralogical treasure house if you had the equipment to
get at it."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Gentlemen, the Horta moves through rock the way we move
through air, and it leaves tunnels."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The greatest natural miners in the
universe."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","It seems to me we could make an agreement, reach a modus
vivendi."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",They tunnel.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","You collect and process, and your process
operation would be a thousand times more profitable."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Can you help it?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",How?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Well, Spock, I'm going to have to ask you to get in touch with
the Horta again."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Tell her our proposition.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","She and her children can do
all the tunnelling they want."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Our people will remove the minerals, and
each side will leave the other alone."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Think she'll go for it?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Very good, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Fine.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, Chief."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I'm delighted to hear that, Chief."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Once
Mother Horta tells her kids what to look for, you people are going to
be embarrassingly rich."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Our pleasure, Chief."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Kirk out.
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",She really liked those ears?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Because she approved of you?
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Does not bear close examination, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I suspect you're
becoming more and more human all the time."
KIRK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Ahead, warp factor two."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I'm sure there is an answer.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","It simply has not yet been
discovered."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","There is no current volcanic activity on this planet, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Oh.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",You mean shot at it.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","(examining a large globe from Vanderberg's desk) Mister
Vanderberg, what is this?"
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","But a geological oddity, to say the least."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Pure silicon?
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","(at the mine map) I've charted the positions of the deaths and
acts of sabotage."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Here, here, and here."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","If the times of these incidents
are to be accepted as accurate, the creature would have to have moved
at an incredible rate of speed."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",If we could force another appearance of this creature
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I wouldn't touch it, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",An extremely active corrosive.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Traces may linger.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The same indication as shown at the door, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","A very strong
corrosive."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Nothing for a device this antiquated, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",The missing pump wasn't taken by accident.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","It was the one piece of equipment absolutely essential for the
operation of the reactor."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It would seem so.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I don't know.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",But there is a possibility.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Life as we know it is universally based on some combination of
carbon compounds, but what if life exists based on another element?"
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","For instance, silicon."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Certainly not phaser one, which is far less powerful than phaser
two."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","It could explain much, especially since the colonists are armed
only with phaser one."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Which I could adjust to be more effective against silicon.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","It may be, Doctor, that the creature can exist for brief periods
in such an atmosphere before returning to its own environment."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","You recall that Vanderberg commented there were
thousands of these at a lower level, the level which the machinery
opened just prior to the first appearance of the creature."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I don't know.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I have already given Doctor McCoy sufficient cause for
amusement."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I'd prefer to cogitate the possibilities for a time.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Captain, the security officers have gathered in Chief
Vanderberg's office."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister Vanderberg, may I ask at which level you discovered the
nodules of silicon?"
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Adjusting my tricorder to register for silicon, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Interesting.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","A life form, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Bearing one hundred eleven degrees,
elevation four degrees."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","No, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Silicon.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","He never even had a chance to fire, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Captain.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",This tunnel.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",My readings indicate it was made within the hour.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Moments ago, in fact."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Positive.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Indeed, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I'm quite at a loss.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Disappeared.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Astonishing that anything of that bulk could move
so rapidly."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Indeed.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",This tunnel was cut within the last two minutes.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Readings indicate a maze of tunnels of this general category in
that direction."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The closest approximation I could come to would be fibrous
asbestos."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","A mineral, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It would seem so.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Silicon-based.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","We are dealing with a silicon creature of the deep rocks,
capable of moving through solid rock as easily as we move through the
air."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Correct.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","This creature's body secretes an extremely powerful
corrosive."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",And it explains the murdered men.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Or a single phaser with much longer contact.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I've run a complete spherical check on all life forms, radius
one hundred miles."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I've located our men, all of them, and I've located
one creature moving rapidly through native rock, bearing two hundred
and one."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",And that is all.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Exactly.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Captain, there are literally thousands of these tunnels
in this general area alone, far too many to be cut by the one creature
in an ordinary lifetime."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Or it is the last of a race of creatures which made these
tunnels."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","If so, if it is the only survivor of a dead race, to kill it
would be a crime against science."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I see no alternative myself, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It merely seems a pity.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",The search team is gathering in the main tunnel.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Gentlemen, if you'll examine your charts, please."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I last located
the creature in the area marked adit26 moving in bearing two zero one."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","This particular group will move out beyond that area in all directions
in an effort to surround it, and possibly capture it."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","You did not, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I merely thought that if the opportunity arose
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Very well, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","II beg your pardon, sir?"
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Is not needed there, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister Scott has far more knowledge of
nuclear reactors than I do."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",You're aware of that.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Captain, there are approximately one hundred of us engaged in
this search, against one creature."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","The odds against you and I both
being killed are 2,228.7 to 1."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","And they are of course accurate, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","That is always my intention, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Captain, we are being watched."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","No, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",We're being watched.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Captain.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Fresh readings within the hour in each of these
tunnels."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Should we separate?
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Indeed?
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I find that most illuminating, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Be absolutely certain you do not damage any
of them."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Only a theory I have.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Captain?
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Are you all right?
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Jim?
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Jim!
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I could phaser you out.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Very well, but I find it extremely
disquieting that your roof chose that particular moment to collapse."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Please proceed with extreme caution.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I shall quicken my pace.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Captain, I just read some fresh signs."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",The creature is in this area.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I'll take
a lifeform reading."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Where, Captain?"
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Kill it, Captain, quickly."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","You don't dare take the chance, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Kill it.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Jim, your life is in danger."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","You can't take
the risk."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I remind you it's a proven killer.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I'm on
my way."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Spock out.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's made no moves against you?
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, I see."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Possibly the answer, Captain, but I'm not certain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Captain, you
are aware of the Vulcan technique of the joining of two minds."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's possible.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",I'll try.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Pain!
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Pain!
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Pain!
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","(he staggers back) That's all I got, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Waves and waves of searing pain.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's in agony.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I don't know, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Evidently, it gained an immediate
knowledge of us from its empathy with me."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","In my brief contact with the
creature's mind, I discovered it is a highly intelligent, extremely
sophisticated animal."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","In great pain, of course, because of its wound,
but not reacting at all like a wounded creature."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","It calls itself a
Horta."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Captain, it has no reason to give us the device, and apparently
every reason for wishing us off this planet."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Jim, I remind you that this is a silicon-based form of life."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Doctor McCoy's medical knowledge will be totally useless.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","To obtain that kind of communication, Captain, it will be
necessary to touch it."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Murder.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Of thousands.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Devils!
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Eternity ends.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",The chamber of the ages.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",The altar of tomorrow!
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Murderers!
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Stop them.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Kill!
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Strike back!
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Monsters!
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",The end of life.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Murderers.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Understood.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It is the end of life.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Eternity stops.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Go out into
the tunnel."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",To the chamber of the ages.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Cry for the children.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Walk
carefully in the vault of tomorrow."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Sorrow for the murdered children.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",The thing you search for is there.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Go.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Go.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Sadness.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Sadness for the end of things.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Go into the tunnel.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","There is a
passageway."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Quickly, quickly."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",(channeling the Horta) It is time to sleep.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It is over.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Failure.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",The murderers have won.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Death is welcome.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Let it end here.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, Captain, eggs and about to hatch."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",There have been many generations of Horta on this planet.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Every
fifty thousand years, the entire race dies, all but one, like this one,
but the eggs live."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","She cares for them, protects them."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","And when they
hatch, she is the mother to them, thousands of them."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","This creature here
is the mother of her race."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",And they are the most inoffensive of creatures.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","They harbour ill
will towards no one."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Except for one thing.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",The Horta is badly wounded.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",It may die.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","It seems logical, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",The Horta has a very logical mind.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","And after close association with humans, I find that curiously
refreshing."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Ship ready to leave orbit, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Course
laid in."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Chief Engineer Vanderberg standing by on channel one.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark",Curious.
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","What Chief Vanderberg said about the Horta is exactly
what the Mother Horta said to me."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","She found humanoid appearance
revolting, but she thought she could get used to it."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Not specifically, but I did get the distinct impression she
found them the most attractive human characteristic of all."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","I didn't
have the heart to tell her that only I have"
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Captain, the Horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive
creature, with impeccable taste."
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Really, Captain, my modesty"
SPOCK,"The
Devil In The Dark","Captain, I see no reason to stand here and be insulted."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",I'd like to examine the body.
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","Schmitter didn't burn to death, not in the usual sense, anyway."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","Well, there are only fragments of bone and teeth left, but the
plant's physician agrees with me."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",A chemical corrosion.
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","Almost as if
he'd been thrown into a vat of extremely corrosive acid."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",Strong enough to eat anything else that you can think of.
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","You're creating fantasies, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","Silicon-based life is physiologically impossible, especially in
an oxygen atmosphere."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",I still think you're imagining things.
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","Yes, Captain?"
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",Is somebody injured?
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",What happened?
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",What in the name of?
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",What is Spock doing?
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",Help that?
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",You can't be serious.
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",That thing is virtually made out of stone!
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","(into communicator) That's right,
Lieutenant."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","Just beam it down to me immediately, and never mind what I
want it for."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",I just want it!
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",Now move!
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",I'll let you know.
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",It won't die.
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","By golly, Jim, I'm beginning to think I can cure a
rainy day."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",Help it?
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",I cured it.
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","Well, I had the ship beam down a hundred pounds of that
thermoconcrete."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","You know, the kind we use to build emergency shelters
out of."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's mostly silicone.
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","So I just trowelled it into the wound,
and it'll act like a bandage until it heals."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark",Take a look.
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","It's as good
as new."
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","Oh, she did, did she?"
MCCOY,"The
Devil In The Dark","Now tell me, did she happen to make any
comment about those ears?"
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark",(entering) I have.
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark",I can't.
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark","I only got a glimpse of it, but it's big and shaggy."
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark",No.
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark",I mean shot it.
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark",With this.
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark",(a hand phaser)
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark","A good, clean shot."
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark",Didn't even slow it down.
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark","Well, I've made my
report to you."
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark","Production has stopped, nobody will go into the lower
levels, and I don't blame them."
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark","If the Federation wants pergium, then
you're going to have to do something about it."
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark","You're all pretty tough, aren't you?"
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark","Starship, phaser banks."
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark","You
can't get your starship down in the tunnels."
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark",That murdering monster's in there and we're going to kill it.
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark",There.
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark",They're coming.
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark",All right!
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark","All right, let's go!"
APPEL,"The
Devil In The Dark","Now look, we have pergium to deliver."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark",A PXK pergium reactor?
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","No, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","We don't
have any spare circulating pump for a thing like that."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","I haven't seen a
PXK in twenty years."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","Well sir, I can put together some odds and
ends, but it won't hold for long."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","Forty eight hours maybe, with a bit of luck."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark",I'll be right down.
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark",Scott out.
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","Well sir, it's a plumber's nightmare, but it'll hold for a bit."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","Sorry, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","That's about the best I can do, but I guarantee it's
not good enough."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","I'll do what I can, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","Scotty here, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","My brilliant improvisation Just gave
up the ghost."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark",It couldn't stand the strain.
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","Negative, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark",It's gone for good.
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark","The reactor will go super-critical in about
ten hours, Sir."
SCOTT,"The
Devil In The Dark",You have that long to find the mechanism.
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark","Aye, aye, sir."
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark","May I ask if you have reason to suspect this
creature may be on that level?"
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark",Did you see it?
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark",Did you shoot at it?
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark","Aye, aye, sir."
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark","Aye, aye, sir."
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark","Louis, Vinci, take your men out."
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark","Giotto here, Captain."
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark",Are you all right?
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark",We're at the end of the tunnel.
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark","Mister
Vanderberg and his men are here, and they're pretty ugly."
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark","Shall I let
them through?"
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark","Aye, aye, sir."
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark","The Captain said for you to wait here, and
here is where you'll wait."
GIOTTO,"The
Devil In The Dark",You're going to stay here.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, we've reached the designated position for scanning the coded directive tape."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Strategically sound.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Organia is the only Class M planet in the disputed area, ideally located for use by either side."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Inhabited by humanoids.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"A very peaceful, friendly people living on a primitive level."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Little of intrinsic value.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Approximately Class D minus on Richter's scale of cultures.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Sir?
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"We've hit him, Captain."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,He's hurt.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Minor, Captain."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,We were most fortunate.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Blast damage in decks ten and eleven, minor buckling in the antimatter pods, casualties very light."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Yes.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,It would seem to be an unfriendly act.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"With the outbreak of hostilities, that might not be easy."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Negotiating with the Organians will be time-consuming, Captain, and time is one thing we'll have the least of."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Yes.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Curious lack of interest.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Notice the ruins in the distance, Captain."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Quite large.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Whatever it is, it would seem to be inconsistent with the reports we've been given on this culture."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,It would seem so.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, if you don't mind, I should like to wander about the village and make some studies."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, our information on these people and their culture was not correct."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,This is not a primitive society making progress toward mechanisation.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,They are totally stagnant.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,There is no evidence of any progress as far back as my tricorder can register.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Nevertheless, it is true."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"For tens of thousands of years, there has been absolutely no advancement, no significant change in their physical environment."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,This is a laboratory specimen of an arrested culture.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Negative, Captain, but it seems a logical development."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,So it would seem.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Not a very pleasant prospect.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, our phasers are gone."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Vulcan merchants are not uncommon, Captain."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,It is a practical approach.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"I am Spock, a dealer in kevas and trillium."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Perfectly, Baroner."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,But it was an interesting experience.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Not necessary, Commander."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,I understand you very well.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"It should not be underestimated, Captain."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,It reaches directly into the mind.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,We Vulcans have certain mental (a Klingon walks past) certain disciplines which enable me to maintain a shield.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Without those disciplines, there would be no protection."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"I'm sorry, sir."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,We did not notice you.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, I strongly suggest we direct our energies toward the immediate problem."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Accomplishing our mission here.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,I thought you might.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,We'll receive no help from the Organians.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Verbal persuasion seems to be ineffective.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Perhaps a more direct approach?
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,You did.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"A very meritorious idea, Captain."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,I'm certain the Klingons will provide whatever is necessary.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"It's a pleasure doing business with you, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,With a delayed action fuse.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,These crates contain chemical explosives.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,They should make a most satisfactory display.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Six, five, four three."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Our fleet will eventually arrive.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"In the meantime, the battle is ours."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,It can be a successful one.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"It's no use, Jim."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,There's no way out.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Six hours, forty three minutes, if the Klingons are punctual."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,They do not seem to understand.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Most peculiar.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"We may not get the chance, Captain."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,These walls are very thick.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Nor do we understand what happened to the guard at the citadel.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Indeed, there are several questions I would like to ask as well."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"It would appear so, Captain."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,But only two.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,More Organians will die.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Difficult to be precise, Captain."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"I should say approximately 7,824.7 to 1."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"7,824.7 to 1."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,I endeavour to be accurate.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Very good.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Clear, Captain."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Less than seven thousand to one, Captain."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,It's remarkable we've got this far.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,(taking his weapon) I believe you'll find that several of them are no longer in perfect operating condition.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,You may be premature.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,There are many possibilities.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Inexplicable, Captain."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Extreme heat.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Not only the weapons but the bodies as well.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Pure energy.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Pure thought.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Totally incorporeal.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Not life as we know it at all.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Conventionalisations, I should say."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Useless to the Organians.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Created so that visitors such as ourselves, could have conventional points of reference."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,We have seen it with our own eyes.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,I should say the Organians are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the amoeba.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,You've been most restrained since we left Organia.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, it took millions of years for the Organians to evolve into what they are."
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,Even the gods did not spring into being overnight.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,You and I have no reason to be embarrassed.
SPOCK,Errand of Mercy,"We did, after all, beat the odds."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Good.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,(puts it into a decoder) We both guessed right.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Negotiations with the Klingon Empire are on the verge of breaking down.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Starfleet Command anticipates a surprise attack.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We are to proceed to Organia and take whatever steps are necessary to prevent the Klingons from using it as a base.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Organia's description, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Another Armenia, Belgium."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,The weak innocents who always seem to be located on the natural invasion routes.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Configuration, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Phaser banks, lock on."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Return fire.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Maintain firing rate.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,One hundred percent dispersal pattern.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Damage control, report to the first officer."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"All hands, maintain general alert."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Hold battle stations.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Damage report, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Maintain surveillance, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Well, we've been anticipating an attack."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I'd say what we've just experienced very nearly qualifies.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Well, there it is."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,War.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"We didn't want it, but we've got it."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"War or not, we've still got a job to do."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Denying Organia to the Klingons.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Lay in a course for Organia, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We won't get it by talking about it.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,The trigger's been pulled.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We have to get there before the hammer falls.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Ahead warp factor seven.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,What bearing?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Mister Sulu, have the phaser crews stand by their positions."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Full power deflector screens.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Mister Spock and I are going to the planet's surface.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You will be in command.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Your responsibility is to the Enterprise, not to us."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Is that clear?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,The Klingon fleet is in this quadrant.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We know that Organia will be a target.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,If they should emerge
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You will evaluate the situation.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"If there is a fleet of them, you'll get out of here, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,No buts.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You'll get to safety and alert the fleet.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You will not attack alone.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Mister Spock and I will be all right.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Mister Spock, let's you and I pay the Organians a visit."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You'd think they had people beaming down every day.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Yes.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"A fortress, perhaps."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,A castle.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Reception committee?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"I am Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,This is my first officer Mister Spock.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I would like to speak to someone in authority.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You people are in great danger.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Is there someplace we can go and talk?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Gentlemen, my government has informed me that the Klingons are expected to move against your planet with the objective of making it a base of operation against the Federation."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"My mission, frankly, is to keep them from doing it."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"No, sir."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"With the Federation, you have a choice."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You have none with the Klingons.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,The Klingons are a military dictatorship.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,War is their way of life.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Life under the Klingon rule would be very unpleasant.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We offer you protection.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You have this planet and its strategic location.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"I assure you that if you don't take action to prevent it, the Klingons will move against you as surely as your sun rises."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"We will help you build defences, build facilities."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Gentlemen, I have seen what the Klingons do to planets like yours."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,They are organised into vast slave labour camps.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,No freedoms whatsoever.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Your goods will be confiscated.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Hostages taken and killed, your leaders confined."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You'd be far better off on a penal planet.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Infinitely better off.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You keep insisting there's no danger.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I keep assuring you there is.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Would you mind telling me
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,That's the first thing that would be lost!
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"I'm a soldier, not a diplomat."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I can only tell you the truth.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Certainly.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,That doesn't seem likely.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,That might be useful.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Gentlemen, I must get you to reconsider."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We can be of immense help to you.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"In addition to military aid, we can send you specialists, technicians."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We can show you how to feed a thousand people where one was fed before.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"We can help you build schools, educate the young in the latest technological and scientific skills."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Your public facilities are almost non-existent.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"We can help you remake your world, end disease, hunger, hardship."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,All we ask in return is that you let us help you.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Now.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"(answering communicator) Excuse me, sir."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Kirk here.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Positive identification?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Mister Sulu, follow your orders."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Get out of here.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Contact the fleet.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Return if the odds are more equal.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Kirk out.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Gentlemen, you kept insisting that there was no danger"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Can you verify that?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,If you had listened to me
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,How does he know that?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"So we're stranded here, in the middle of a Klingon occupation army."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"You have a gift for understatement, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,It's not a very pleasant prospect at all.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Did you take them?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I must ask you to return them.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,They know that Vulcan is a member of the Federation.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,What about the rest of you?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"You have a lot to learn, sir."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"And if I know the Klingons, you'll be learning it the hard way."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I have a tongue.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,My what?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,He's no spy.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,He's done nothing.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Nothing at all.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You're here.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,There's nothing I can do about it.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You need my approval?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You seem to be in command.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Me?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I don't want the job.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,And Mister Spock?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,He is my friend.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I don't understand.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,And you're proud of it.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Are you sure you're all right?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Or I will be killed.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,That mindsifter can't be all the terror they think it is.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I'll try and avoid it.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"You didn't really think I was going to beat his head in, did you?"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You're right.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"But as you say, we still have a job to do."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Maybe, but sooner or later they'll start resenting how the Klingons run things."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"If we could prove to them they could do something to strike back, to keep the Klingons off balance."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,That's exactly what I had in mind.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Mister Spock Did I or did I not see something that looked like a munitions dump outside of Kor's headquarters?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I think it's time we did a little simple and plain communicating.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Tonight.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We're short of tools.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Okay so far.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Sonic grenade?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"You were right, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,A most satisfactory display.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Of course we blew it up.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Deliberately.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We did it to show you that you can fight back.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"You don't have to be sheep, you can be wolves."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,History is full of examples of civil populations fighting back successfully against a military dictatorship.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"We may not be able to destroy the Klingons, but we can tie them up."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Blow up their installations, disrupt their communications, make Organia useless to them."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Why?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Are you afraid of retribution?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Does your personal freedom mean so little to you?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,All I understand is that you apparently don't have the backbone to fight and protect your loved ones.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"I speak of courage, gentlemen."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Does courage mean so little to you?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Ayelborne!
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"I'm used to the idea of dying, but I have no desire to die for the likes of you."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"No, thank you."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,What do you want from me?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You think I'm going to sit here and just talk with the enemy?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Something was destroyed?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Nothing inconsequential, I hope."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We're nothing like you.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We're a democratic body.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"It's a very large universe, Commander, full of people who don't like the Klingons."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Go climb a tree.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"It will take a lot longer than that, Commander."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,How much of the twelve hours do we have left?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I think we can count on them being punctual.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Blowing that munitions dump wasn't enough.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"If we get out of here, we've got to carry the attack directly to Kor."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,These Organians
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Nevertheless, our orders still stand."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We've got to make some attempt to neutralise the Klingon occupation.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,And there are guards every few feet down the hall.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Go?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You turned us over to them.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You expect us to trust you now?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We can't stay here.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,This is the first place they'll look.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"First you turn us in, then get us out."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"What are you doing now, waiting for the Klingons to post a reward so you can turn us in again and collect it?"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,What happened to them?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Is that's all you can do, smile?"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"I want to know how I'm free, and why."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"This idiotic placidity of yours, your refusal to do anything to protect yourselves"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Those are Klingon phasers.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Take the door.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Get down, gentlemen."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Did you hear them?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Well, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,It seems it's up to you and me.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,The Federation has invested a great deal of money in our training.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,They're about due for a small return.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We have two hours with which to do it in.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,No.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"No more will die on account of us, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Where are those phasers?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You've told us a great deal about how you hate violence.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Unless you tell me where those phasers are, you're going to have more violence than you know what to do with."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,It's entirely up to you.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Gentlemen, I have no great love for you, your planet, your culture."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Despite that, Mister Spock and I are going to go out there and quite probably die, in an attempt to show you that there are some things worth dying for."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Come on, Mister Spock, let's get out of here."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Mister Spock, can we get those two guards?"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,What would you say the odds on our getting out of here?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Difficult to be precise?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"7,824 to 1?"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,That's a pretty close approximation.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You do quite well.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Set your phaser on stun.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"We're after the top dog, not the members of the pack."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"But if the situation calls for it, we kill, is that clear?"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I'll take the one on the left.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Fire.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"If you don't tell me what I want to know, I'll kill you here and now."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Is that clear?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Is Kor's office down there?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,What about the hostages?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Talk.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Talk.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,To be killed?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Mister Spock.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Well, what are the odds now?"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Less than seven thousand to one.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Well, getting better."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Getting better.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Just stay where you are, Commander."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Checkmate, Commander."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I don't intend to kill you unless I have to.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Cover, Spock!"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Back!
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"What is it, Spock?"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You are stopping this?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Come in.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Stand by, Sulu."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,What have you done?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You're talking nonsense.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You can't just stop the fleet.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,What gives you the right?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We have legitimate grievances against the Klingons.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"They've invaded our territory, killed our citizens."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,They're openly aggressive.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,They've boasted that they'll take over half the galaxy.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You're the ones who issued the ultimatum to withdraw from the disputed areas!
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,You should be the first to be on our side.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,Two hundred hostages killed.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Even if you have some power that we don't understand, you have no right to dictate to our Federation"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,How to handle their interstellar relations!
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We have the right
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Well, no one wants war."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,But there are proper channels.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,People have a right to handle their own affairs.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Eventually, we would have"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"What do you mean, beings like yourselves?"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,But what about this planet?
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"The fields, the buildings, this citadel?"
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Well, Commander, I guess that takes care of the war."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Obviously, the Organians aren't going to let us fight."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I'm embarrassed.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,I was furious with the Organians for stopping a war I didn't want.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We think of ourselves as the most powerful beings in the universe.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,It's unsettling to discover that we're wrong.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,"Oh, no, no, no, Mister Spock, We didn't beat the odds."
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,We didn't have a chance.
KIRK,Errand of Mercy,The Organians raided the game.
SULU,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, the automatic deflector screen just popped on."
SULU,Errand of Mercy,Body approaching.
SULU,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, the other ship doesn't register."
SULU,Errand of Mercy,Only drifting debris.
SULU,Errand of Mercy,We got him.
SULU,Errand of Mercy,"No contact, Captain."
SULU,Errand of Mercy,He blew up all right.
SULU,Errand of Mercy,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,Errand of Mercy,"Yes, sir."
SULU,Errand of Mercy,"Perfectly, sir."
SULU,Errand of Mercy,"We'll handle them, sir."
SULU,Errand of Mercy,"But, Captain"
SULU,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, a large number of Klingon vessels have just arrived."
SULU,Errand of Mercy,They're opening fire.
SULU,Errand of Mercy,"Yes, sir."
SULU,Errand of Mercy,My screens are up.
SULU,Errand of Mercy,I can't drop them to beam you aboard.
SULU,Errand of Mercy,Captain.
SULU,Errand of Mercy,I can't explain it.
SULU,Errand of Mercy,We were just closing in on the Klingon fleet when
SULU,Errand of Mercy,Every control on our ship became too hot to handle.
SULU,Errand of Mercy,Our power's gone.
SULU,Errand of Mercy,Our phaser banks are dead.
UHURA,Errand of Mercy,"Automatic all-points relay from Starfleet Command, Captain, code one."
UHURA,Errand of Mercy,Captain.
UHURA,Errand of Mercy,"Unit XY-75847 report a fleet of Klingon ships in their sector, sir."
UHURA,Errand of Mercy,"Unable to ascertain, sir."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Welcome.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,You are our visitors.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Welcome, welcome."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,I am Ayelborne.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"You are most welcome, my friend."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"We don't have anybody in authority, but I am the chairman of the Council of Elders."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Perhaps I would do.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Oh, yes."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Our council chambers are nearby.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Please.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Of course, my friend."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Our village is yours.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Captain.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"What you're saying, Captain, is that we seem to have a choice between dealing with you or your enemies."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"We are a simple people, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,We have nothing that anybody could want.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"We have no defences, Captain, nor are any needed."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, we see that your concern is genuine."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,We are moved.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,But again we assure you we are in absolutely no danger.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"If anybody is in danger, you are, and that concerns us greatly."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,It would be better if you returned to your ship as soon as possible.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"It is our way of life, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"If you will excuse us, Captain, we will discuss your kind offer."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"We have discussed your offer, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Our opinion is unchanged.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,We are in no danger.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"We thank you for your kind offer of assistance, although we must decline it, and we strongly recommend that you leave Organia before you yourselves are endangered."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, I can see that you do not understand us."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Perhaps
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"That is correct, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,There is no danger.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Thank you, Trefayne."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, since it is too late for you to escape, perhaps we should do something about protecting you."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Oh, our friend Trefayne is really quite intuitive."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,You can rest assured that what he says is absolutely correct.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Yes, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,I took them.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"I'm sorry, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,I cannot do that.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Were you armed, you might be tempted to use violence, and that we cannot permit."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"You, Captain, will pass as an Organian, and Mister Spock."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Mister Spock presents a problem.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,He doesn't look like an Organian.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,We shall continue as before.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,We have nothing to fear.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"I am Ayelborne, temporary head of the council."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,I bid you welcome.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"He is Baroner, one of our leading citizens."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"We shall obey your regulations, Commander."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Commander, I assure you our people want nothing but peace."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,We shall cause you no trouble.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,But that was violence.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, I implore you never to do such a thing again."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"How little you understand us, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"What are you going to do with him, Commander?"
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"There's no need to use your machine on him, commander."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,I can tell you his name.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,It is Captain James T. Kirk.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"For some reason, he feels that he must destroy you, Commander, just as you feel you must destroy him."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,I didn't want you to harm him.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"I'm sorry, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,It was for the best.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,No harm would come of it.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Oh, there you are, gentlemen."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,I trust you are in good health?
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Shall we go?
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Yes.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Your captors plan to do violence to you.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,That we cannot permit.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,I came to take you away.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Is there really a choice, Captain?"
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,I offer you safety.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"They will not come here, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,You may believe me.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"How little you understand us, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Please do not concern yourself about them.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Why, nothing happened to them, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Nothing at all.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"You are free, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,We have already answered that question.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"To us, violence is unthinkable."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Yes, of course, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,But nothing has changed.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,I cannot tell you.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,You mean you would actually use force?
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Very well, but it will do you no good."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,They're in that cabinet.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,There are only two of you against an army.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Don't you realise that what you intend to do will be hopeless?
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Yes, but so foolish."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Of course, we cannot allow it."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,To stop them is very bad.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Trefayne.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,And then?
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,We will wait.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Very well.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Prepare yourselves.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"We are terribly sorry to be forced to interfere, gentlemen, but we cannot permit you to harm yourselves."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,The same conditions exist on both the star-fleets.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,There will be no battle.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,I suggest you contact them.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"You too, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Your ship is now within range of your communications device.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"As I stand here, I also stand upon the home planet of the Klingon Empire, and the home planet of your Federation, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,I'm putting a stop to this insane war.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,It is being done.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Unless both sides agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities, all your armed forces, wherever they may be, will be immediately immobilised."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"It is no trick, Commander."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,We have simply put an end to your war.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"All your military forces, wherever they are, are now completely paralysed."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"No one has been killed, Captain."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"To wage war, Captain?"
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,To kill millions of innocent people?
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,To destroy life on a planetary scale?
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,Is that what you're defending?
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Oh, eventually you will have peace, but only after millions of people have died."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"It is true that in the future, you and the Klingons will become fast friends."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,You will work together.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Yes, please leave us."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,The mere presence of beings like yourselves is intensely painful to us.
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,"Millions of years ago, Captain, we were humanoid like yourselves, but we have developed beyond the need of physical bodies."
AYELBORNE,Errand of Mercy,That of us which you see is mere appearance for your sake.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,"We thank you for your altruistic offer, Captain, but we really do not need your protection."
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,We must be sure you are not harmed.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,"A Vulcan trader, perhaps."
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,A dealer in kevas and trillium.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,Harmless to the Klingons.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,Terrible to destroy.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,Brave men.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,It is necessary.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,They may harm one another.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,It will be hard.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,We have put a stop to your violence.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,All instruments of violence on this planet now radiate a temperature of three hundred and fifty degrees.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,They are inoperative.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,"We find interference in other people's affairs most disgusting, but you gentlemen have given us no choice."
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,No one has died here in uncounted thousands of years.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,Your emotions are most discordant.
CLAYMARE,Errand of Mercy,"We do not wish to seem inhospitable, but gentlemen, you must leave."
TREFAYNE,Errand of Mercy,"Ayelborne, eight space vehicles have assumed orbit around our planet."
TREFAYNE,Errand of Mercy,They are activating their material transmission units.
TREFAYNE,Errand of Mercy,"Ayelborne, several hundred men have appeared near the citadel."
TREFAYNE,Errand of Mercy,They bring many weapons.
TREFAYNE,Errand of Mercy,"Ayelborne, this is of no matter."
TREFAYNE,Errand of Mercy,Perhaps you'd better let him have what he wants.
TREFAYNE,Errand of Mercy,He
TREFAYNE,Errand of Mercy,"Interesting, however."
TREFAYNE,Errand of Mercy,They will wait until darkness.
TREFAYNE,Errand of Mercy,Terrible.
TREFAYNE,Errand of Mercy,Inconceivable.
TREFAYNE,Errand of Mercy,Savage.
TREFAYNE,Errand of Mercy,It has begun.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,This is the ruling council?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,No doubt you do.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"I am Kor, military governor of Organia."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,(looking at Kirk) Who are you?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,And he has no tongue?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Good.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You will be taught how to use it.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Where is your smile?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"The stupid, idiotic smile everyone else seems to be wearing."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,A Vulcan.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Do you also have a tongue?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Well, have we a ram among the sheep?"
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Do you object to us taking him?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Coming from an Organian, yours is practically an act of rebellion."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Very good.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,(to the Council) So you welcome me.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,(to Kirk) Do you also welcome me?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Good honest hatred.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Very refreshing.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"However, it makes no difference whether you welcome me or not."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I am here and will stay.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You are now subjects of the Klingon Empire.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You'll find there are many rules and regulations.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,They will be posted.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Violation of the smallest of them will be punished by death.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"You disapprove, Baroner."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I need your obedience.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Nothing more.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Will I have it?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Yes.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I am.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I shall need a representative from among you.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Liaison between the forces of the occupation and the civil population.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Smile and smile.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I don't trust men who smile too much.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"You, Baroner, you're the man."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Have I asked whether or not you want it?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,We Klingons have a reputation for ruthlessness.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You will find that it is deserved.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Should one Klingon soldier be killed, a thousand Organians will die."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I will have order.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Is that clear?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I'm sure you will not.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Take the Vulcan to the examination room.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"(to Kirk) You, come with me."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I will familiarise you with your new duties.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You are concerned?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You have a poor choice of friends.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,He will be examined.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"If he is lying, he will die."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"If he is telling the truth, he will find that business has taken a turn for the worse."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Take him.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You do not like to be pushed.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Very good.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"You may be a man I can deal with, Baroner."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Come with me.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"From this day on, no public assemblages of more than three people."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,All publications to be cleared through this office.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Neighbourhood controls will be established, hostages selected."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,A somewhat lengthy list of crimes against the state.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You do not like them?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,(Spock is brought in.)
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Well?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Nothing else?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You are sure?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Very well, Lieutenant."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Would you like to try our little truth finder?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"It's a mind-sifter or mind-ripper, depending on how much force is used."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"We can record every thought, every bit of knowledge in a man's mind."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Of course, when that much force is used, the mind is emptied."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Permanently, I'm afraid."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,What's left is more vegetable than human.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"It is a tool, a weapon."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Somewhat drastic, but very efficient."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"All right, Vulcan, you may go."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,But you are an enemy alien.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You will be under our scrutiny at all times.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,If I have to warn you
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Return to your council, Baroner."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You will receive our official notifications as soon as they are published.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,In the meantime keep the people in order.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,It is your responsibility.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,That is exactly right.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You will be killed.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You speak of courage.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Obviously you do not know the difference between courage and foolhardiness.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Always it is the brave ones who die.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,The soldiers.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I hope you will continue to savour the sweetness of your life.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You disgust me.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,What is always done with spies and saboteurs.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"He will be killed, after he has had first-hand experience of our mind scanner."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,What?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,(A big grin spreads across his face) Captain of the USS Enterprise.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,A starship commander.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,And his first officer?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"I had hoped to meet you in battle, but"
KOR,Errand of Mercy,That's going to be rather difficult now.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Isn't it, Captain?"
KOR,Errand of Mercy,What an admirable people.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Do you always betray your friends?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"I don't blame you, Captain."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Lock up the Vulcan.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Take the Captain to my office.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,We'll have a talk before I do what must be done.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"You'll have a drink with me, Captain?"
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I assure you it isn't drugged.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"With our mind-scanner, we have no need for such crude methods."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Oh, a very great deal, but first I want to talk."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Just talk.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You'll talk.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Either here, now, voluntarily, or under our mind-scanner."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"The fact is, Captain, I have a great admiration for your Starfleet."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,A remarkable instrument.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,and I must confess to a certain admiration for you.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"I know, of course, that it was you who destroyed our supplies last night."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Hardly.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"They were quite important to us, but they can be replaced."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"You of the Federation, you are much like us."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Come now.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I'm not referring to minor ideological differences.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I mean that we are similar as a species.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Here we are on a planet of sheep.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Two tigers, predators, hunters, killers, and it is precisely that which makes us great."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,And there is a universe to be taken.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Excellent.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Then it shall be a matter of testing each other's wills.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Of power.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Survival must be earned, Captain."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Tell me about the dispersal of your Starfleet.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"I can get what I want through our mind-scanner, but there would be very little of your mind left, Captain."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I have no desire to see you become a vegetable.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"This friend of yours, the Vulcan."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,He seems to have the ability to block our scanner.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I think perhaps I will find out why.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I will have him dissected.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Your friend killed.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"You, a mental vegetable."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Not a pleasant prospect, Captain, but it lies ahead for you unless you tell me everything I want to know."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Twelve hours, Captain."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Longer than that I will not wait.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"I respect you, Captain, but this is war, a game we Klingons play to win."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Take him to the cell with his friend.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,And watch him closely.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Don't you see I'm busy?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You mean they've escaped?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,If you're lying to me.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"All right, Lieutenant."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Implement Special Occupation Order Number Four.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Immediately!
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Attention.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Attention all Organians.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Attention.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,This is Commander Kor.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"The two Federation prisoners have escaped, obviously with outside aid."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,They will be returned immediately.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"So that you will know we mean what we say, listen."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"In the courtyard of my headquarters,"
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Two hundred Organians have just been killed.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"In two hours, two hundred more will die, and two hundred more after that until the two Federation spies are turned over to us."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,This is the order of Kor.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Nothing?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"They know what death is, don't they?"
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Bad enough to be a military governor, but to govern a population of sheep!"
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Very well, Lieutenant, round up two hundred more."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,(going into his office) Fools!
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Will I have to kill them all?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You have done well to get this far through my guards.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"So, you are here."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You will be interested in knowing that a Federation fleet is on its way here at the moment.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Our fleet is preparing to meet them.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Shall we wait and see the results before you kill me?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Sentimentality, mercy."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,The emotions of peace.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Your weakness, Captain Kirk."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,The Klingon Empire shall win.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Think of it, as we sit here, in space above us the destiny of the galaxy will be decided for the next ten thousand years."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Can I offer you a drink?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,We can toast the victory of the Klingon fleet.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Today we conquer.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"If some day we are defeated, well, war has its fortunes good and bad."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Do you know why we are so strong?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Because we are a unit.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Each of us is part of the greater whole, always under surveillance."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Even a commander like myself, always under surveillance, Captain."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,If you will note.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Shoot!
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Shoot!
KOR,Errand of Mercy,What are you talking about?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,My fleet!
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Ridiculous!
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"My fleet, it's helpless."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You're what?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You can't interfere.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,What happens in space is not your business.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Why not?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,We're the stronger!
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"You've tried to hem us in, cut off vital supplies, strangle our trade!"
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You've been asking for war!
KOR,Errand of Mercy,They are not disputed!
KOR,Errand of Mercy,They're clearly ours.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,And now you step in with some kind of trick.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You are liars.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,You are meddling in things that are none of your business.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Or our Empire!
KOR,Errand of Mercy,Never!
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"Captain, it's a trick."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,We can handle them.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,I have an army.
KOR,Errand of Mercy,But is all of this possible?
KOR,Errand of Mercy,"A shame, Captain."
KOR,Errand of Mercy,It would have been glorious.
KOS,Errand of Mercy,You do not look like a storekeeper.
KOS,Errand of Mercy,Take this man.
KOS,Errand of Mercy,Vulcans are members of the Federation.
KOS,Errand of Mercy,He may be a spy.
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,"He is what he claims to be, Commander, a Vulcanian merchant named Spock."
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,His main concern seems to be how he would carry out his business under our occupation.
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,The usual.
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,A certain amount of apprehension regarding us.
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,The mind is remarkably disciplined.
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,"I used force four, which is sufficient to break down any pretence."
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,Commander!
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,The two Federation prisoners.
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,They're gone.
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,I swear.
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,No one was at fault.
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,"The guards, ten of them were constantly on duty watching the cell."
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,"Then when they opened it to give them food, they simply weren't there, and there was no way out."
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,I swear!
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,Sir!
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,"No results, Commander."
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,I cannot understand these people.
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,They do not seem to be worried about anything.
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,"Yes, sir."
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,Yes.
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,Yes.
KLINGON,Errand of Mercy,I am to gather two hundred more.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Stay on top of it, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Understood, Engineer."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Mister Spock?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","We can't avoid these areas of
turbulence."
KIRK,"The

KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",To the Bridge.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Spock?
KIRK,"The

KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Open the channel to Starfleet Command.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Precautionary measure, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Broadcast to Starfleet Command my
past week's log entries, starting with the unusual readings we had on
the instruments and how they led us here."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Inform Starfleet Command that
apparently something or someone down on this planet"
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",(pointing to Sulu) Bones.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Can effect changes in time, causing
turbulent waves of space displacement."

KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Who, me, Doctor?"
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Mister Spock?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Bones!
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Get back to your positions.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",It was set for cordrazine.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Communications, emergency medical team."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Security alert.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Continue alert, decks four through eleven."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",The medical department knows as little as we do.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","In dosages approaching
this, there's some record of wild paranoia."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Bridge here.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Go ahead.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","So whatever's down there, McCoy is in the heart of it."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Set up a
landing party."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Let's go get him.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Kirk out.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",These ruins extend to the horizon.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Begin recording.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Detail, fan out."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","What is this thing, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","It seems to be
pulsating with power of some kind."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Analysis, please."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",That's funny.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Explain.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Then what is it?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",What are you?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Are you machine or being?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Annoyed, Spock?"
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Spock!
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","If that is a doorway back through time, could we somehow
take Bones back a day in time, then"
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Guardian.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Can you change the speed at which yesterday passes?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Strangely compelling, isn't it?"
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","To step through there and lose
oneself in another world."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Bones, no!"
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Where is he?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Scotty.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",McCoy has somehow changed history.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Earth's not there.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","At least, not the Earth we know."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","We're totally
alone."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Make sure we arrive before McCoy got there.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","It's vital we stop
him before he does whatever it was that changed all history."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Guardian, if we are successful"
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Scotty, when you think you've waited long enough."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Each of you
will have to try it."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Even if you fail, at least you'll be alive in some
past world somewhere."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I've seen old photographs of this period.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","An economic upheaval
had occurred."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",We seem to be costumed a little out of step with the time.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Well, Mister Spock, if we can't disguise you, we'll find some way
of explaining you."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Let's get out of here.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Well, we'll steal from the rich and give back to the poor later."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I think I'm going to like this century.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Simple, easier to manage."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","We're
not going to have any difficulty explaining"
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You're a police officer.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I recognise the traditional
accoutrements."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",My friend is obviously Chinese.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I see you've noticed the ears.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",They're actually easy to explain.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",The unfortunate accident he had as a child.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","He caught his head in
a mechanical rice picker."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","But fortunately, there was an American
missionary living close by who was actually a skilled plastic surgeon
in civilian life."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Oh, how careless of your wife to let you go out that way."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","You were actually enjoying my predicament
back there."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","At times, you seem quite human."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Sorry.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Time we faced the unpleasant facts.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Arrives where?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Honolulu, Boise, San Diego?"
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Why not Outer
Mongolia, for that matter?"
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","And the same currents that swept McCoy to a certain time and
place might sweep us there, too."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Couldn't you build some form of computer aid here?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Yes, well, it would pose an extremely complex problem in logic,
Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Excuse me.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I sometimes expect too much of you.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Excuse us, miss."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",We didn't mean to trespass.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",It's cold outside.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",No.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",We were being chased by a policeman.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",These clothes.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",We stole them.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",We didn't have any money.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Mine is Jim Kirk.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",His is Spock.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Excuse me, Miss."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Where are we?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Do you run this place?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Radio tubes and so on.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I approve of hobbies, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Why?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Shut up.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Shut up.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I want to hear what she has to say.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Development of atomic power is years away, and space flight years
after that."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I find her most uncommon, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Then we can report back for other work?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",A what?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Oh.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Thank you.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",We have a flop.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",A place to sleep.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Mister Spock, I've brought you some assorted vegetables, baloney
in a hard roll for myself, and I've spent the other nine tenths of our
combined salaries for the last three days on filling this order for
you."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Mister Spock, this bag does not contain platinum, silver or gold,
nor is it likely to in the near future."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","McCoy'll be along in a few days, perhaps sooner."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","There's no
guarantee that these currents in time will bring us together."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","This has
to work."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Your hat.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","If Mister Spock says that he needs the tools and that they'll be
returned tomorrow morning, you can bet your reputation on that, Miss
Keeler."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",We served together.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Let me help.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","A hundred years or so from now, I believe, a famous
novelist will write a classic using that theme."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","He'll recommend those
three words even over I love you."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Silly question.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Want to hear a silly answer?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",A planet circling that far left star in Orion's belt.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",See?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",How are the stone knives and bearskins?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I think you may also find you have a connection burning someplace.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Good.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Let's see what you have.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","February 23rd, 1936."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Six years from now.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","(reading below the
headline FDR confers with slum area 'angel') The President and Edith
Keeler conferred for some time today"
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",How bad?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",The President and Edith Keeler.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",We know her future.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Within six years from now, she'll become very
important."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Nationally famous.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You must be mistaken.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",They both can't be true.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","She has two possible futures then, and depending on whether she
lives or dies, all of history will be changed."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",And McCoy
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","In his condition, what does he do?"
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Does he kill her?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Get this thing fixed.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",We must find out before McCoy arrives.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",How do you know?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",And make them spend it on life?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",The very same.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",How long before we get a full answer?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","McCoy could have been in the city a week now for all we know, and
whatever he does that affects her and changes history could happen
tonight or tomorrow morning."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I must know whether she lives or dies, Spock."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I must know what to
do."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Germany.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Fascism.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Hitler.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",They won the Second World War.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",But she was right.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Peace was the way.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",No.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",How did she die?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",What day?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Spock, I believe I'm in love with Edith Keeler."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Edith.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",With ulterior motives.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Does that please you?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","No, of course you didn't."
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",It's not yet time.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",McCoy isn't here.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",What?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",McCoy!
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Leonard McCoy?
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Stay right here.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Spock!
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Stay right there!
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",McCoy!
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",He's in
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Edith.
KIRK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Let's get the hell out of here.
SULU,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","We're holding orbit, sir."
SULU,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",The helm is sluggish.
SCOTT,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Control circuits threatening to overload, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Switching to manual, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Do we maintain this orbit?
SCOTT,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",(at the helm) We're guiding around most of the time ripples now.
SCOTT,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Doctor McCoy!
SCOTT,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Nothing wrong with the communicator, sir."
SCOTT,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You mean we're stranded down here?
SCOTT,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Then even finding McCoy would be a miracle.
SCOTT,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Aye.
SCOTT,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Good luck, gentlemen."
SCOTT,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","What happened, sir?"
SCOTT,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You only left a moment ago.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I believe we'll have them plotted in a few more orbits, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","This is of great scientific importance, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","We're actually
passing through ripples in time."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","All plotted but one, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Coming up on it now.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Seems to be
fairly heavy displacement."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","The hypo, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Empty.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Confirmed by the library record tapes, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Subjects failed
to recognise acquaintances, became hysterically convinced that they
were in mortal danger, and were seeking escape at any cost."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Extremely
dangerous to himself or to anyone else who might"
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","And the transporter at that time, Captain, was focused on the
centre of the time disturbance."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",And of considerable age.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","On the order of ten thousand centuries
old."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Unbelievable, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",This single object is the source of all the time displacement.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I can't.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","For this to do what it does is impossible by any
science I understand."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",It is operating even now.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Putting out waves and
waves of time displacement, which we picked up millions of miles away."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Incredible power.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","It can't be a machine as we understand
mechanics."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I see no reason for answers to be couched in riddles.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","A time portal, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","A gateway to other times and dimensions,
if I'm correct."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Really.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Relive the accident.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","This time be certain that the hypo accident
is avoided."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Look at the speed with which the centuries are passing,
Captain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",To step through on precisely the day we wish
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I am a fool.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","My tricorder is capable of recording even at this
speed."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I've missed taping centuries of living history which no man
before has ever"
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","With no past, no future."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I was recording images at the time McCoy
left."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",A rather barbaric period in your American history.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I believe I
can approximate just when to jump."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Perhaps within a month of the
correct time."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","A week, if we're fortunate."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",There is no alternative.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Seconds now, sir."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Stand by.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",And now.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","It was called Depression, circa 1930."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Quite barbaric.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I'm afraid I'm going to be difficult to explain in any case,
Captain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",That should prove interesting.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Theft, Captain?"
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You were saying you'll have no trouble explaining it.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Perhaps the unfortunate accident I had as a child.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Oh, yes, it's quite untidy."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Here, let me help you."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Captain, I hardly believe that insults are within your
prerogative as my commanding officer."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","First, I believe we have about a week before McCoy arrives, but
we can't be certain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",There is a theory.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","There could be some logic to the belief that
time is fluid, like a river, with currents, eddies, backwash."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Unless that is true, Captain, we have no hope."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Frustrating.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Locked in here is the place and moment of his arrival, even the images
of what he did."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","If only I could tie this tricorder in with the ship's
computers for just a few moments."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",In this zinc-plated vacuum-tubed culture?
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",At what rate of payment?
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I need radio tubes and so forth.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","My
hobby."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Yes, of course, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Speculation.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Gifted insight.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","We have a what, Captain?"
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",One might have said so in the first place.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Captain, I must have some platinum."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","A small block would be
sufficient, five or six pounds."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","By passing certain circuits through
there to be used as a duodynetic field core..."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Captain, you're asking me to work with equipment which hardly
very far ahead of stone knives and bearskins."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Captain.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Captain, in three weeks at this rate, possibly a month,
I might reach the first mnemonic memory circuits."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I am endeavouring, ma'am, to construct a mnemonic memory circuit
using stone knives and bearskins."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Captain.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Tools for finely detailed work.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I needed the fine tools for my radio work.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","They'd have been
returned in the morning."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Interesting.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Where would you estimate we belong, Miss Keeler?"
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I'll finish with the furnace.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I may have found our focal point in time.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Yes.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I'm overloading those lines.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I believe we'll have our
answer on this screen, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","And, Captain, you may find this a bit distressing."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I've slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Bad enough.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","It would seem unlikely, Jim."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","A few moments ago, I read a 1930
newspaper article."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Or Captain, Edith Keeler will die this year."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I saw her obituary.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Some sort of traffic accident.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Captain, Edith Keeler is the focal point in time we've been
looking for, the point that both we and Doctor McCoy have been drawn
to."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Is the random element.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Or perhaps he prevents her from being killed.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","We don't know
which."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Captain, suppose we discover that in order to set things
straight again, Edith Keeler must die?"
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I'll need at least two more days before I dare make another
attempt."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Captain, our last bit of information was obtained at the expense
of thirty hours work in fused and burned circuits."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","This is how history went after McCoy changed
it."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Here, in the late 1930s."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","A growing pacifist movement whose
influence delayed the United States' entry into the Second World War."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","While peace negotiations dragged on, Germany had time to complete its
heavy-water experiments."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Because all this lets them develop the A-bomb first.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","There's no
mistake, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Let me run it again.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Edith Keeler.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Founder of the
peace movement."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","She was right, but at the wrong time."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","With the A-bomb, and with
their V2 rockets to carry them, Germany captured the world."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","And all this because McCoy came back and somehow kept her from
dying in a street accident as she was meant to."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","We must stop him, Jim."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","We can estimate general happenings from these images, but I
can't trace down precise actions at exact moments, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I'm sorry.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Jim, Edith Keeler must die."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Captain, I did not plan to eavesdrop."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I must point out that when she stumbled, she might have died
right there, had you not caught her."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",We're not that sure of our facts.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Who's to say when the exact
time will come?"
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Save her, do as your heart tells you to do, and
millions will die who did not die before."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",What is it?
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","No, Jim!"
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","He knows, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",He knows.
SPOCK,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",We were successful.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Some heart flutter.
MCCOY,"The

MCCOY,"The

this?"
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",(he drops the bottle) No!
MCCOY,"The

MCCOY,"The

MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","It's they
who do the killing!"
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Don't run!
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I won't kill you!
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I'm glad you got away, too."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Why do you think they want to kill
us?"
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Where?
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Where are we?
MCCOY,"The

MCCOY,"The

MCCOY,"The

MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Explain this trick.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Biped.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Small.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Good cranial development.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","No doubt considerable
human ancestry."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Is that how you're able to fake all of this?
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Very good.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Modern museum perfection.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Right down to the cement beams.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Very, very
good."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Oh, I'd give a lot to see the hospital."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Probably needles and
sutures."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",All the pain.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","They used to hand-cut and sew people like
garments."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Needles and sutures.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Oh, the terrible pain!"
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Oh, Miss."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","That coffee, it just smells wonderful."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I can't.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I got to keep moving.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I can't let them find me.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","The most common question to ask would be, where am I?"
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I don't
think I'll ask it."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","The only possible answer would conclusively prove that I'm
either unconscious or demented."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","This looks like old Earth around 1920
or 25."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I am unconscious, or demented."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I'm a surgeon, not a psychiatrist."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I am Leonard McCoy, Senior
Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",It's quite all right.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","It's quite all right dear, because I don't
believe in you, either."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Come in.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Thank you.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","No, not particularly."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","You know, I've convinced myself that this
is all in a cordrazine hallucination, but I've decided you're not."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","But if you're not, what are you?"
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I don't doubt it.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",What about this place?
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Do you run it?
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Why?
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Well, it was for me, at least."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You may have saved my life.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Not as wrong as the bottle I drank from.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Allow me to show my
gratitude."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Perhaps there's something I can do around here to thank you.
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",A who movie?
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Well, I know what a movie is, but."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","You deliberately stopped me, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I could have saved her.
MCCOY,"The

know what you just did?"

UHURA,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",No sign of Doctor McCoy.
UHURA,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Search
progressing."
UHURA,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Captain, I've lost contact with the ship."
UHURA,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I was talking to them.
UHURA,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Suddenly, it went dead."
UHURA,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","No static, just nothing."
UHURA,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Captain, I'm frightened."
UHURA,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Captain, it seems impossible."
UHURA,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Even if you were able to find the
right date"
UHURA,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Happiness at least, sir."
UHURA,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Captain, the Enterprise is up there."
UHURA,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","They're asking if we want
to beam up."

question."
GUARDIAN,"The

race was born, I have awaited a question."
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I am the Guardian of Forever.
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I am both and neither.
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I am my own beginning, my own ending."
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I answer as simply as your level of understanding makes
possible."
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",As correct as possible for you.
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Your science knowledge is
obviously primitive."
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Behold.
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","A gateway to your own past, if you wish."
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I was made to offer the past in this manner.
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I cannot change.
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",He has passed into what was.
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Your vessel, your beginning, all that you knew is gone."
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Then you will be returned.
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","It will be as though none of you
had gone."
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Time has resumed its shape.
GUARDIAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",All is as it was before.
GUARDIAN,"The

such journeys are possible."
GUARDIAN,"The

DRIVER,"The

DRIVER,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Why don't you watch where you're going?
POLICEMAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Well?
POLICEMAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","All right, all right."
POLICEMAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Drop those bundles and put your hands
on that wall there!"
POLICEMAN,"The

POLICEMAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",What?
POLICEMAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Where?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Who's there?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",A lie is a poor way to say hello.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",It isn't that cold.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Why?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Well, I could do with some help around here."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Doing dishes,
sweeping, general cleaning."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Fifteen cents an hour for ten hours a day.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",What are your names?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I'm Edith Keeler.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You can start by cleaning up down here.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You're in the 21st Street Mission.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Indeed I do, Mister Kirk."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Good evening.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Now, as I'm sure somebody out there has said, it's time to pay
for the soup."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Now, let's start by getting one thing straight."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I'm not a
do-gooder."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","If you're a bum, if you can't break off of the booze or
whatever it is that makes you a bad risk, then get out."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Now I don't
pretend to tell you how to find happiness and love when every day is
just a struggle to survive, but I do insist that you do survive because
the days and the years ahead are worth living for."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","One day soon man is
going to be able to harness incredible energies, maybe even the atom."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Energies that could ultimately hurl us to other worlds in some sort of
spaceship."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","And the men that reach out into space will be able to find
ways to feed the hungry millions of the world and to cure their
diseases."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","They will be able to find a way to give each man hope and a
common future, and those are the days worth living for."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Our deserts
will bloom."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",(She continues under the dialogue.)
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Prepare for tomorrow.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Get ready.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Don't give up.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Mister Kirk.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You are uncommon workmen.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","That basement looks like
it's been scrubbed and polished."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Yes.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Seven o'clock in the morning.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Do you have a flop for the
night?"
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","You really are new at this, aren't you?"
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","A flop is a place to
sleep."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","There's a vacant room at the place where I live for two dollars
a week."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",If you want to I'll take you there.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Good.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","If you can leave immediately, I can get you five hours work at
twenty two cents an hour."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",What?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",What on Earth is that?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","That toolbox was locked with a combination lock and you opened
it like a real pro."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Why did you do it?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I'm sorry, I can't"
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",On one condition.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Walk me home?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I still have a few questions I'd
like to ask about you two."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Oh, and don't give me that questions about
little old us?"
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",look.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","You know as well as I do how out of place you two
are around here."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","At his side, as if you've always been there and always
will."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",And you?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You belong in another place.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I don't know where or how.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I'll figure it out eventually.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Captain.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Even when he doesn't say it, he does."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Why does Spock call you Captain?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Were you in the war together?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",And you don't want to talk about it?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Why?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Did you do something
wrong?"
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Are you afraid of something?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Whatever it is, let me help."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Centuries from now?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Who is he?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Where does he come from er, where will he
come from?"
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Yes.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Why?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",What is so funny about man reaching for the moon?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I just know, that's all."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I feel it.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","And more, I think that one
day they'll take all the money they spend now on war and death"
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Yes.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You see the same things that I do.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","We speak the same
language."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You look terrible!
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You'd better sit down.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Come on.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",There's a cot in the back room.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",They won't find you there.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Come
on."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Hey, now, come on."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","You're not ready to take on any tigers just
yet."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Lie down.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Why not?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Would you care to try for 30?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I have a friend that talks about Earth the same way that you do.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Would you like to meet him?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I don't mean to disbelieve you, but that's hardly a Navy
uniform."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Get some rest.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Are you following me, sir?"
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I hope it means (she stumbles on the step and Kirk catches her,
while Spock watches.)"
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Oh!
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",How stupid!
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I've been up and down those
stairs a thousand times."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I could have broken my neck.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Well, you look just fine, Doctor."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I thought you might like to see the evening paper.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",That's reassuring.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",A friend.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","When you showed up here, you looked like you could use
one."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I try to.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",It's necessary.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Lots of people drink from the wrong bottle sometimes.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",We can talk about that later.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I have to go.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","My young man is
taking me to a Clark Gable movie."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",A Clark Gable.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Don't you know?
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",That's very strange.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You get some rest.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",I'll see you later.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","If we hurry, maybe we can catch the Clark Gable movie at the
Orpheum."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","You know, Doctor McCoy said the same thing."
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",Yes.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",He's in the Mission.
EDITH,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",He's
MAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You'll be sorry.
MAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",You expect to eat for free or something?
MAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","You got to listen to
Goody Two-shoes."
MAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Not that she's a bad-looking broad, but if she really wanted to
help out a fella in need"
MAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever",No!
MAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","Look, fella, you take a sip too much of that old wood alky, and,
and almost anything seems like it"
MAN,"The
City on the Edge of Forever","I, I,"

KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Try it.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Evaluation, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"And next in line, Deneva."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Bones, what's your theory about the cause of all this?"
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"But it follows a definite pattern, a systematic progression from planet to planet."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Plot an interception course, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Warp factor eight.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Lieutenant Uhura, try to contact that ship."

KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Acknowledge.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Reverse course.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,One hundred and eighty degrees about.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Very well.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Reduce to sub-warp speed.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Take us to Deneva.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,That Denevan ship headed deliberately into the sun.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Why?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Keep trying.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Put it on audio.

KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Keep trying to raise them.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Yes.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,You were right a while back.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,My brother Sam lives on Deneva.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,He's a research biologist.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,That woman sounded like his wife Aurelan.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Set your phasers on stun.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,We're going to beam directly into the capital city.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Alert status.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Mister Spock.

KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Let's go.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Energise.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,There are almost a million inhabitants of Deneva.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,There's more than one hundred thousand in this city alone.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Where is everyone?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,My brother's lab is over there.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,They signalled us once.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,There should be someone there.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Let's find out what's happening.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Stand by to fire.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Fire.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Did you hear what they said, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,They tried to brain us with these clubs.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Check them out, Bones."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,To say the least.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Fan out.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Follow me.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Security.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,(bearhugging her) Aurelan.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Bones.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"(McCoy sedates her) Aurelan, you're safe now."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Sam.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,It is my brother.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Was my brother.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Peter?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Get ready to beam up.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Yes.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Yes, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,You heard my sister-in-law say something about they being here.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Your guess.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,It doesn't make sense.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,There are no harmful life forms reported.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Our sensors didn't pick up anything that didn't belong here.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Take charge of the landing party, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,I want some answers to all this.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Can she talk?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Aurelan?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Aurelan, it's Jim."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,He's dead.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,But your son's still alive.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,You've got to help us.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Yes, I'm here."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"You have to tell us what happened, Aurelan, to you and the others."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Who?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,What kind of things?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Aurelan, it's important that you tell us."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,What kind of things?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"(One last scream and convulsion, then all her readings plummet to zero."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,My brother's son?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Report.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,You've seen some kind of creature?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Any alien form?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,All right.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Let's go find out what it is.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Set your phasers on force three, to kill."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"We're looking for some kind of creature, and we already know it will kill."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Spock!
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Form a ring.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Fire!
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,And it can bear up under full phaser power.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,It's too close in here.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,It may be a trap in here.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Let's move out.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Spock!
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Spock!
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,(He pulls it off) It's gone.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Can you stand?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Spock, are you all right?"
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,How is he?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Did you operate on Spock in time?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,My nephew?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Recommendations?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"All decks, security alert."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Locate and restrain Mister Spock.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,He may be dangerous.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Use phasers on stun if necessary.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Get him back to the Sickbay.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Use security restraints.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Spock.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,You're only half-Vulcan.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,What about the human half of you?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Can he control it the way he says, Bones?"
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"I need you, Spock, but we can't take any chances."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,We'll keep you confined for a while longer.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"If you can maintain control, we'll see."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,My nephew.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"If he regains consciousness, will he go through that?"
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Help them.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,I don't care what it takes or costs.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,You've got to help them.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Mister Spock, I gave you an order to stay in the Sickbay."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Scotty?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Mister Spock, your logic, as usual, is inescapable."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Beam him down.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Stay in constant touch with us.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Give him your phaser.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"He'll need that, too."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Energise.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"I don't have to, Bones."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,We both know he is.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Yes.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,That would answer a lot of questions.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,I think so.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,This may be one cell in a larger organism.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"An incredibly huge organism, in fact."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Existing so differently from any living matter or energy as we know it, that it may have come here, planet by planet, from an entirely different galaxy."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"But not impossible, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"The Denevan that flew into the sun cried out that he was free, that he'd won."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"That's the angle to work on, gentlemen."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,I want an analysis of all this from Medical and Life Science departments within the hour.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Then you're wasting your time.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,There has to be something that'll kill the creature without destroying the human host.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"I can't accept that, Bones."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,We've got fourteen science labs aboard this ship.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,The finest equipment and computers in the galaxy.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"No, no, Bones."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,There's more than two lives at stake here.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"I cannot let it spread beyond this colony, even if it means destroying a million people down there."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Gentlemen.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"I will accept neither of those alternatives, gentlemen."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"I cannot let this thing expand beyond this planet, nor do I intend to kill a million or more people to stop it."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,I want another answer.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,I'm putting you gentlemen on the hot seat with me.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,I want that third alternative.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Report.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Request denied.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Request denied.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,There must be another answer.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Something in the sun killed that thing before the Denevan died.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,All right.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,All right.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"We've tried heat, radiation."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,What other qualities or properties does the sun have?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,But one other thing you haven't mentioned.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,It's bright.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,It radiates a blinding light if you're close enough.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Not to us.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"But down on the surface, the creatures stayed in the shadows for the most part."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Suppose they weren't simply hiding.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Suppose they're sensitive to light.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Light, like in a sun, close up."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"No, but you can move the equivalent of the sun to Deneva."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Mister Spock?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Good.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Let's get on it.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Your figures are, of course, accurate."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,It worked in a lab.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,With the creature exposed to everything we can give it.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,But what about the people who are infected?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Maybe.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"There's no time for maybes, Bones."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,We need to know now.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Yes, we'd have to put someone who's infected under that light."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"We have to duplicate the conditions on the planet, and Spock"
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"There's no other way, Bones."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,We have to duplicate the brilliance that existed at the moment the Denevan declared himself freed.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,I agree completely.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Proceed.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Spock, are you all right?"
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,What is it?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Are you telling me that Spock need not have been blinded?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Bones, take care of him."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Good.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Scanners?
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Satellite control, this is the Captain."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Energise all satellites.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Report.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Sickbay.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Tell Spock it worked.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Bones, it wasn't your fault."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Bones.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Bones.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Yeoman, record this for Starfleet Command."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,The alien creatures on Deneva have been destroyed
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Spock.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,You can see.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Mister Spock.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,Regaining eyesight would be an emotional experience for most.
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"You, I presume, felt nothing?"
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"If you gentlemen are finished, would you mind laying in a course for Starbase Ten, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"What's that, Doctor?"
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"You've been so concerned about his Vulcan eyes, Doctor, you forgot about his Vulcan ears."
KIRK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Ahead warp factor one, Mister Sulu."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"No, sir."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,I've tried every major transmitting station on Deneva.
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,None of them have acknowledged my contact signal.
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"But sir, that's a call sign for a private transmitter."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"Making contact, Captain."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"Captain, I'm having difficulty on that transmitter call to Deneva."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,Captain.
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"I've made contact with your private transmitter, sir."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"Contact broken, sir."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"Sorry, sir."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"I'm afraid that's impossible at the moment, Captain."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,They stopped broadcasting immediately.
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,They do not acknowledge my contact signal.
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"Captain, receiving messages from a ground station."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,"The things are dying, sir."
UHURA,Operation: Annihilate!,It's working.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"As I speculated, Captain, the overall pattern of mass insanity destroying civilisations follows an almost straight line through this section of the galaxy."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Over here the Beta Portilin system the ancient civilisations.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Archaeologists have given us information indicating that they were the beginning.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Two hundred years ago, Levinius Five was swept by mass insanity, then Theta Cygni Twelve."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"The last was Ingraham B, two years ago."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"The ship is a one-man vessel of Denevan configuration, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,He does not seem to be out of control.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,His course is straight for the sun.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Outer hull temperature now four hundred and eighty degrees and rising.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,So are we.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Hull temperature one thousand degrees and rising.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,The sun's gravimetric pull increasing.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"All clear, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Hull temperature falling, gravimetric pull approaching tolerance level."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Planet development is normal, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Originally colonised as a freighting-line base in this area.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,No Federation contacts for over a year.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Lieutenant Uhura has had no further response to our signals.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Sensors report the expected number of humans on the planet surface.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"However, they are strangely quiet."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Very little activity.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"They're here, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,In the buildings.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Strangely quiescent.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Captain, several people approaching."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Indeed.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,They seemed most concerned for our safety.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Their attitude was inconsistent with their actions.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Captain, I understand how you must"
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Notice the ventilator, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Apparently they were trying to keep something outside from getting in.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Obviously they were not entirely successful.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,That is correct.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I am at a loss to understand it.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"The streets are extraordinarily quiet, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"We've seen no other Denevans, and the ones we stunned earlier were gone when we came out."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,A peculiar buzzing sound.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,We were about to investigate it.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Incredible.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Not only should it have been destroyed by our phasers, it does not even register on my tricorder."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,It is not life as we know or understand it.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Yet t is obviously alive, it exists."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Captain, I suggest we risk taking it aboard."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,No!
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,No!
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,(he sits up)
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"(hoarsely) No, I won't."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I must take the ship.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Down!
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I must take it down.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Doctor McCoy.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Captain.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,These restraints will no longer be necessary.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Nor will your sedatives, Doctor."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I'll be able to return to duty.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I apologise for my weakness earlier when I tried to take control of the ship.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I simply did not understand.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"I am a Vulcan, Doctor."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Pain is a thing of the mind.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,The mind can be controlled.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"It is proving to be an inconvenience, but it is manageable."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"And the creature, with all of its thousands of parts, even now is pressuring me."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"(the pain indicator hits the top of the monitor) It wants this ship, but I am resisting."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"I have my own will, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Let me help.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I am a Vulcan.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I am a Vulcan.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,There is no pain.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I was.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I have an errand on the planet's surface.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,You will beam me down to the same co-ordinates as before.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"That is an order, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Until the pain was gone, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,It has been discontinued by me.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"One of the creatures will have to be captured and analysed, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,We did not have a clear opportunity to do so earlier when I was attacked.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Since my nervous system is already affected, as you pointed out, Doctor, I don't believe they can do much more to me."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"I am in complete control of myself, Doctor."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,The fact that I am here proves that I do not belong in bed.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Thank you, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Come in, gentlemen."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I believe you'll find this interesting.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,(McCoy scans Spock.)
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Doctor, your medical skill and curiosity are quite admirable, but I assure you I'm all right."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Unimportant at the moment, Doctor."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Please observe.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Interesting, gentlemen."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"A one-celled creature resembling, more than anything else, a huge, individual brain cell."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Do you understand what I'm suggesting, Captain?"
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"And although it is not physically connected to the other cells, it is nevertheless part of the whole creature, guided by the whole, drawing its strength from the whole, which probably accounts for its unusual resistance to our phaser weapons."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,From a place where our physical laws do not apply.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"We may therefore find it difficult to destroy, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"I regret I see no other choice for you, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,We already know this thing has destroyed three civilisations.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Perhaps more.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Including myself, Doctor, and Captain Kirk's young nephew."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Understandably upsetting, but once it spreads past here, there are dozens of colonies beyond and billions of people."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I therefore request permission to beam down to the planet's surface.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I also suggest that your nephew accompany me.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Captain, I do not make this request lightly."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I do not know how much longer I can hold out against the pain.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,But I do know what the boy will go through should he regain consciousness.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,It exists physically.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,It occupies space.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"It has mass, therefore gravity."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,It converts matter to energy.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,A possibility.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Yes.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"In essence, it can be done."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,A string of satellites around the planet with burning tri-magnesite and trevium.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Of course.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,The light of the sun at the proximity where the Denevan declared himself free was one million candles per square inch.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"If this works, the satellites we orbit will produce light of such intensity that even someone in a closed, darkened area will be affected by it."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Captain, you'll need a host for the next step in the test to determine whether the creature can be driven from the body."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I am the logical choice.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"There'll be none on the planet's surface, Doctor."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,The creature within me is gone.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I am free of it and the pain.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,And I'm also quite blind.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"An equitable trade, Doctor."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Thank you.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Interesting.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which humans cannot hear, these creatures evidently are sensitive to light which we cannot see."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,Doctor it was my selection as well.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,It is done.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"An hereditary trait, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"The brightness of the Vulcan sun has caused the development of an inner eyelid, which acts as a shield against high-intensity light."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Totally instinctive, Doctor."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"We tend to ignore it, as you ignore your own appendix."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Quite the contrary, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,I had a very strong reaction.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,My first sight was the face of Doctor McCoy bending over me.
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"My pleasure, Captain."
SPOCK,Operation: Annihilate!,"Why, thank you, Doctor McCoy."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,There's no medical or scientific cause for what happened on those planets.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Jim.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,There's one possibility.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"The mass insanity may have reached this planet, too."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Jim, your brother Sam and his family, aren't they stationed on this planet?"
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Jim, did you know who that woman was?"
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"There's something wrong, Jim."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Their nervous systems.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Unconscious like this, there should be just routine autonomic activity, but I'm getting a very high reading, as though even in their unconscious state, they're being violently stimulated."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Is this your brother, Jim?"
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"I'm sorry, Jim."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"The boy's unconscious, but he's still alive."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,I'd better get the boy and his mother back to the ship.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,I can't do much for them down here.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,McCoy to Enterprise.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Prepare to beam up party of four.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Ready to beam up, Captain."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,I'd like you to be onboard when your sister-in-law regains consciousness.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,I won't be able to give you the exact cause until I get the plates back from the lab.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,They're both in extreme pain.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,I sedated them heavily.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,But your sister-in-law seems to have a high tolerance.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,The tranquilliser hasn't affected her much.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Yes.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"When she answers questions, any questions, it's as if she's fighting to get the answers out."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,As though something is exerting pain to stop her.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"I'll do everything I can, Jim, to save him."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Nurse.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,That's the second time he's come out of it.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Either he's fighting us, or something inside of him is fighting us."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Let's prepare to close.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Nurse!
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Miss Chapel.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Miss Chapel, if you cannot assist me as required, call another nurse in here."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,But do one or the other now.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"To be very frank, Jim, I don't know that I can do anything for Spock or your nephew."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,(hold up the jar) They're pieces of some form of living tissue.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"I removed one from Spock's spinal cord, the other from your sister-in-law's body."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,They're both the same.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,The boy's too weak to touch.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Besides, removal of the tissue wouldn't stop the pain anyhow as far as I can tell."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,No.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,I just removed these for examination.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"His body's full of these tentacles, entwining and growing all about his nervous system."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,The same.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Evidently, when the creature attacks, it leaves a stinger much like a bee or wasp, leaving one of these in the victim's body."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"It takes over the victim very rapidly, and the entwining is far, far too involved for conventional surgery to remove."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"I'm sorry, Jim."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"The lab, the science departments, we're all stumped."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,The K3 indicator registers the level of pain.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Watch as I turn it on.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,That's what he's been going through.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,I've never seen anything like it.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,No wonder the poor devils go mad.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Who knows, Jim?"
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"I know the amount of pain the creature can inflict upon him, but whether he can control it hour to hour"
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Yes.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Jim, aren't you forgetting something?"
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"There are over a million colonists on that planet down there, just as much your responsibility."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"They need your help, too."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Jim, this is ridiculous."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,I don't want my patients running around.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,He should be in bed.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Jim, that man is sick."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Don't give me any damnable logic about him being the only man for the job.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"You may be controlling the pain, Mister Spock, but you're far from all right."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"I'm sorry, Captain."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,I've tried everything I can.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Variant radiation, intense heat, even as great as nine thousand degrees."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Which happens to be my point.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"The thing won't die, even at temperatures and radiation which would burn Spock and your nephew to ashes."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Captain, I understand your concern."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Your affection for Spock, the fact that your nephew is the last survivor of your brother's family."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Gentlemen, I want it stopped, too, but not at the cost of destroying over a million people."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"If killing five people saves ten, it's a bargain."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Is that your simple logic, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"I'm sorry, Jim."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"We've been over and over it, made every conceivable test."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Jim, we've been through it and through it."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Radiation, heat"
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Nothing lethal about light.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"You can't move Deneva closer to the sun, Jim."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Well, I can rig a test cubicle in the bio-lab, put our specimen in it."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,But I don't
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Put on your masks.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Completed.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,It worked!
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,We can do it.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"What's the matter, Jim?"
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,We can do it.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Well, I don't know."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Maybe trial
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,But I'd have to put a
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Do you have any idea of the risk?
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Do you know what one million candlelight per square inch can do to your optic nerves?
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,All right.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,I'll rig up a protective pair of goggles.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Unfortunately, you're both right."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,It's the only thing we can do.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"All right, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Mister Spock's the best first officer in the fleet.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Completed.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"(reading) Oh, no."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,I threw the total spectrum of light at the creature.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,It wasn't necessary.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,I didn't stop to think that only one kind of light might've killed it.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"I didn't need to throw the blinding white light at all, Jim."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Spock, I"
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,McCoy here.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"Yes, Captain."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,He'll be happy to hear that.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"The blindness was temporary, Jim."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,There's something about his optical nerves which aren't the same as a human's.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"'Tis a pity your brief blindness did not increase your appreciation for beauty, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,Unusual eye arrangement.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,I might've known he'd turn up with something like that.
MCCOY,Operation: Annihilate!,"I said, please don't tell Spock I said he was the best first officer in the fleet."
SULU,Operation: Annihilate!,"Captain, we're picking up a ship on our sensors, heading directly into the Denevan sun."
SULU,Operation: Annihilate!,He'll burn up.
SULU,Operation: Annihilate!,"He's too close, Captain."
SULU,Operation: Annihilate!,"He burned up, Captain."
SULU,Operation: Annihilate!,"Aye, sir."
SULU,Operation: Annihilate!,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,Operation: Annihilate!,"Completing the seeding orbit, Captain."
SULU,Operation: Annihilate!,Two hundred and ten ultraviolet satellites now in position.
SULU,Operation: Annihilate!,"Seventy two miles altitude, permanent orbit about the planet."
SULU,Operation: Annihilate!,"Ready, Captain."
SULU,Operation: Annihilate!,"Warp factor one, sir."
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,"Out of range, sir."
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,"Captain, we'll get too close to the sun."
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,"Aye, they make regular trips from here carrying supplies to the asteroid belt for the miners and bringing cargo out."
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,I've made the run a couple of times myself as an engineering advisor.
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,"None, sir."
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,Just that noise we heard.
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,"Mister Spock, I thought you were still confined to Sickbay."
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,"Here, now."
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,Where do you think you're going?
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,"Not likely, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,"Aye, sir, and I'm sorry I have to disobey it."
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,The Captain said no one was to transport down.
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,Mister Spock.
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,"Freeze right there, Mister Spock, or I'll put you to sleep for sure."
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,This is Mister Scott in the transporter room.
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,Get me the Captain.
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,"He said he was transporting down to the surface, sir."
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,Your orders were that no one was to beam down unless you authorised it.
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,"And knowing Mister Spock's determination on some things, I thought I'd better hold him here until I got your orders."
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,"Scanners ready, sir."
SCOTT,Operation: Annihilate!,"All satellites operative, Captain."
PILOT,Operation: Annihilate!,I did it.
PILOT,Operation: Annihilate!,It's finally gone.
PILOT,Operation: Annihilate!,I'm free.
PILOT,Operation: Annihilate!,I'm
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Please hurry.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Help us.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,I don't have much time.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,They'll know.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Please!
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Please help us
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,They're here!
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,They're here!
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Please keep them away!
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,They're here!
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,They're here!
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Jim?
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,"Sam, he's"
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,You are here.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,"It is you, Jim."
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,They came eight months ago.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Things.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Horrible things!
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Visitors brought them in their vessel from a planet.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Ingraham B.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Not the ship's crew's fault.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,The things made them bring their ship here.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Not their fault.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,They use it to control us.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,"They're spreading, Jim."
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,They need us to be their arms and legs.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,They're forcing us to build ships for them.
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Don't let them!
AURELAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Don't let them go any further!
ZAHRA,Operation: Annihilate!,"Yes, sir."
ZAHRA,Operation: Annihilate!,"Captain, it doesn't even look real."
ZAHRA,Operation: Annihilate!,"Ready, sir."
ZAHRA,Operation: Annihilate!,"Captain, look."
ZAHRA,Operation: Annihilate!,Mister Spock.
MEN,Operation: Annihilate!,Go back!
MEN,Operation: Annihilate!,Get away!
MEN,Operation: Annihilate!,We don't want to hurt you!
MEN,Operation: Annihilate!,Go back!
MEN,Operation: Annihilate!,Get out of here.
MEN,Operation: Annihilate!,"Go on, get away!"
MEN,Operation: Annihilate!,Go away!
MEN,Operation: Annihilate!,Get out of here!
MEN,Operation: Annihilate!,We don't want to hurt you.
CHAPEL,Operation: Annihilate!,"Doctor, the readings have never looked like that before, not even on Mister Spock."
CHAPEL,Operation: Annihilate!,"Doctor, that's not all you're going to do?"
CHAPEL,Operation: Annihilate!,"Doctor, there is more of it in him, entwined all through his body."
CHAPEL,Operation: Annihilate!,Mister Spock.
CHAPEL,Operation: Annihilate!,Mister Spock.
CHAPEL,Operation: Annihilate!,"Bridge, this is Sickbay."
CHAPEL,Operation: Annihilate!,Tell Doctor McCoy Mister Spock just left here.
CHAPEL,Operation: Annihilate!,He's delirious and possibly dangerous.
CHAPEL,Operation: Annihilate!,"Ready, Doctor."
CHAPEL,Operation: Annihilate!,"Doctor, the results of the first tests on the creature's remains."
MAN,Operation: Annihilate!,Affirmative.
UHURA,Catspaw,"Still no response, sir."
UHURA,Catspaw,"Contact established, Captain."
UHURA,Catspaw,I'm sorry.
UHURA,Catspaw,"I can't clear it, Captain."
UHURA,Catspaw,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,Catspaw,Enterprise.
UHURA,Catspaw,Lieutenant Uhura here.
UHURA,Catspaw,"Captain, we are only registering on you."
UHURA,Catspaw,(static) Captain?
UHURA,Catspaw,Captain Kirk?
UHURA,Catspaw,"Mister DeSalle, that's exactly what happened to Mister Scott and his party."
UHURA,Catspaw,"They, they just disappeared."
UHURA,Catspaw,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,Catspaw,"Captain, are you all right?"
UHURA,Catspaw,Where are you?
UHURA,Catspaw,"Are the others all right, sir?"
UHURA,Catspaw,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
UHURA,Catspaw,"Come in, please."
UHURA,Catspaw,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
UHURA,Catspaw,Acknowledge.
UHURA,Catspaw,"We've lost him again, Mister DeSalle."
UHURA,Catspaw,I don't see any change.
UHURA,Catspaw,"Standing by, Captain."
KIRK,Catspaw,"No, keep it open."
KIRK,Catspaw,I don't like this.
KIRK,Catspaw,Nothing since the first check in.
KIRK,Catspaw,Scott and Sulu should've contacted us again a half an hour ago.
KIRK,Catspaw,Both those men are well aware of landing party procedure.
KIRK,Catspaw,They should've checked in with us by now.
KIRK,Catspaw,Enterprise.
KIRK,Catspaw,Kirk here.
KIRK,Catspaw,One?
KIRK,Catspaw,"Jackson, where are Scott and Sulu?"
KIRK,Catspaw,Jackson!
KIRK,Catspaw,Notify Transporter room to prepare to beam up one member of the landing party.
KIRK,Catspaw,Then have Doctor McCoy report to me in the Transporter room on the double.
KIRK,Catspaw,Energise.
KIRK,Catspaw,Trouble.
KIRK,Catspaw,"(one man materialises) Jackson, where are the others?"
KIRK,Catspaw,Odd.
KIRK,Catspaw,Our probe data didn't indicate fog.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Readings, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Catspaw,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Catspaw,"What are the ship's sensors reading now, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,Catspaw,"Lieutenant, can you hear me?"
KIRK,Catspaw,I don't know.
KIRK,Catspaw,"There has to be some explanation for the fact that the ship's sensors can't register anything but us, while we're picking up readings of multiple life forms."
KIRK,Catspaw,"Are they still there, Spock?"
KIRK,Catspaw,Stand-by alert.
KIRK,Catspaw,Quiet.
KIRK,Catspaw,Who are you?
KIRK,Catspaw,Spock.
KIRK,Catspaw,Comment?
KIRK,Catspaw,"A more useful comment, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Catspaw,That's useful.
KIRK,Catspaw,That's where we're going.
KIRK,Catspaw,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,Catspaw,"What about it, Spock?"
KIRK,Catspaw,Does this structure have anything to do with communicator interference?
KIRK,Catspaw,And it doesn't pick up on our ship's sensors.
KIRK,Catspaw,Could it be exerting a force field of some kind that cuts into our sensor scan.
KIRK,Catspaw,If we weren't missing two officers and a third one dead I'd say someone was playing an elaborate trick or treat on us.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Yes, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Catspaw,You'd be a natural.
KIRK,Catspaw,I'll explain it to you one day.
KIRK,Catspaw,Shall we have a look around?
KIRK,Catspaw,(sending them off in different directions) Bones.
KIRK,Catspaw,Spock.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Straight ahead, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Catspaw,Spock.
KIRK,Catspaw,Are you all right?
KIRK,Catspaw,Bones?
KIRK,Catspaw,(sees another skeleton chained to the wall) Doc?
KIRK,Catspaw,"Dungeons, curses, skeletons and iron maidens."
KIRK,Catspaw,They're all Earth manifestations.
KIRK,Catspaw,Why?
KIRK,Catspaw,None of this parallels any human development.
KIRK,Catspaw,It's more like a human nightmare.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Ghost stories, ogres, demons."
KIRK,Catspaw,The whole
KIRK,Catspaw,"Scotty, Sulu."
KIRK,Catspaw,Scotty.
KIRK,Catspaw,Put down the phaser.
KIRK,Catspaw,Scotty!
KIRK,Catspaw,These two are alive.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Scotty, do you hear me?"
KIRK,Catspaw,"Sulu, do you know who I am?"
KIRK,Catspaw,What's happened to you?
KIRK,Catspaw,"Whoever you are, you've proven your skill at creating illusion."
KIRK,Catspaw,Now I want to know why and what you've done to my men.
KIRK,Catspaw,Not when one of my men is dead because of it and two others turned into mindless
KIRK,Catspaw,Who are you?
KIRK,Catspaw,Why did you bring us here?
KIRK,Catspaw,Why?
KIRK,Catspaw,For what reason?
KIRK,Catspaw,Why all the mumbo-jumbo?
KIRK,Catspaw,That cat.
KIRK,Catspaw,Superstition.
KIRK,Catspaw,"All right, Korob."
KIRK,Catspaw,What do you want from us?
KIRK,Catspaw,You'll find us most unco-operative unless you start explaining yourself.
KIRK,Catspaw,We could manufacture a ton of these on our ship.
KIRK,Catspaw,They mean nothing to us.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Whatever it is you read, you read it wrong."
KIRK,Catspaw,"As for leaving, we'll leave when we're ready."
KIRK,Catspaw,Don't move!
KIRK,Catspaw,(hands it to Spock) Cover them.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Now, I want the rest of our weapons and our equipment."
KIRK,Catspaw,I want some answers.
KIRK,Catspaw,You can't think a man to death.
KIRK,Catspaw,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Catspaw,Come in.
KIRK,Catspaw,Come in.
KIRK,Catspaw,Enterprise.
KIRK,Catspaw,From Captain Kirk.
KIRK,Catspaw,Come in.
KIRK,Catspaw,Never mind about us.
KIRK,Catspaw,What's happening up there?
KIRK,Catspaw,"DeSalle, channel bypass power into your heat dissipation units."
KIRK,Catspaw,All right.
KIRK,Catspaw,I'll handle it down here.
KIRK,Catspaw,Kirk out.
KIRK,Catspaw,(taking the model from Sylvia and the phaser from Spock) You've won.
KIRK,Catspaw,You seem to be singing a different tune.
KIRK,Catspaw,I'd rather know more about yours.
KIRK,Catspaw,"You call it magic, you call it science."
KIRK,Catspaw,It seems unrelated to both of them.
KIRK,Catspaw,"I wouldn't attempt to name it, but you seem to do with your mind what we do with tools."
KIRK,Catspaw,"You alter matter, move it about by telekinesis."
KIRK,Catspaw,It's too late for threats.
KIRK,Catspaw,You let me contact the ship.
KIRK,Catspaw,How long do you think it will it be before a search party arrives?
KIRK,Catspaw,We have nothing to discuss.
KIRK,Catspaw,How long has it been?
KIRK,Catspaw,Thanks.
KIRK,Catspaw,I wonder what they're doing to Doc.
KIRK,Catspaw,Familiar.
KIRK,Catspaw,Startling.
KIRK,Catspaw,Not rational.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Ghosts, witches."
KIRK,Catspaw,They tried to tap our conscious mind.
KIRK,Catspaw,He expected me to react as though it were all normal.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Well, he admitted that they weren't native to this planet."
KIRK,Catspaw,"They refer to us as creatures, as though we were some species that they were unfamiliar with."
KIRK,Catspaw,"If we're creatures, I wonder what they're really like."
KIRK,Catspaw,Agreed.
KIRK,Catspaw,Totally alien.
KIRK,Catspaw,"And I don't like hostile strangers showing such an acute interest in our galaxy, our world, Spock."
KIRK,Catspaw,Not at all like friendly visitors.
KIRK,Catspaw,"We're going to have to stop them, cold."
KIRK,Catspaw,But at the moment
KIRK,Catspaw,"Oh, Bones."
KIRK,Catspaw,Doc.
KIRK,Catspaw,What now?
KIRK,Catspaw,"You wave your magic wand and destroy my mind, too?"
KIRK,Catspaw,You don't call that damage?
KIRK,Catspaw,You'd know if you had compassion.
KIRK,Catspaw,"A woman should have compassion, but I forget you're not a woman."
KIRK,Catspaw,You seem to need us.
KIRK,Catspaw,Why?
KIRK,Catspaw,What about Korob?
KIRK,Catspaw,Why don't you simply probe my mind and get what you want?
KIRK,Catspaw,You're very persuasive.
KIRK,Catspaw,What happens if I go along?
KIRK,Catspaw,For the same reasons you excite me.
KIRK,Catspaw,You're a very beautiful woman.
KIRK,Catspaw,You have a knack for giving me difficult choices.
KIRK,Catspaw,(kisses her again) You have nothing like that where you come from?
KIRK,Catspaw,"Your people, when they come here"
KIRK,Catspaw,(nuzzling her neck) Transmuter?
KIRK,Catspaw,Then it's a device.
KIRK,Catspaw,You do use tools.
KIRK,Catspaw,You haven't changed your mind?
KIRK,Catspaw,You won't return home?
KIRK,Catspaw,And why not?
KIRK,Catspaw,You've been using me and my crew.
KIRK,Catspaw,I'm not leaving without my men.
KIRK,Catspaw,Transmuter.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Yes, she mentioned that."
KIRK,Catspaw,Why a cat?
KIRK,Catspaw,You'd better let us.
KIRK,Catspaw,(draws the phaser) It's out of energy.
KIRK,Catspaw,She must have drained it.
KIRK,Catspaw,We could have jumped Scott and Sulu at any time.
KIRK,Catspaw,We didn't know.
KIRK,Catspaw,No way out.
KIRK,Catspaw,Do you think you can make it?
KIRK,Catspaw,(to Korob) Get ready.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Korob, that door won't last."
KIRK,Catspaw,Korob seemed to think this was important.
KIRK,Catspaw,Said something about a transmuter.
KIRK,Catspaw,Doc.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Well, at least we found them."
KIRK,Catspaw,Maybe we do.
KIRK,Catspaw,"(he gets the wand) Sylvia, I have the transmuter."
KIRK,Catspaw,It's mine now.
KIRK,Catspaw,Don't you get tired of these games?
KIRK,Catspaw,"I wasn't sure before, but I am now."
KIRK,Catspaw,"This is the source of your power, isn't it."
KIRK,Catspaw,The transmuter.
KIRK,Catspaw,I catch on quickly.
KIRK,Catspaw,Why?
KIRK,Catspaw,Because your people have nothing of your own?
KIRK,Catspaw,Is that why you need us?
KIRK,Catspaw,No.
KIRK,Catspaw,I don't know what you are but you're not a woman.
KIRK,Catspaw,You've tortured my men and taken their minds from them.
KIRK,Catspaw,You ask for love and return pain instead.
KIRK,Catspaw,"That'll take some explaining, Bones."
KIRK,Catspaw,Not everything.
KIRK,Catspaw,Korob and Sylvia as they really are.
KIRK,Catspaw,"Their forms were an illusion, just like the castle and everything else."
KIRK,Catspaw,Only the power pack gave them reality.
KIRK,Catspaw,No illusion.
KIRK,Catspaw,Jackson is dead.
KIRK,Catspaw,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Catspaw,Come in.
KIRK,Catspaw,Five to beam up.
SPOCK,Catspaw,They may have nothing to report.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Our sensors indicate no life forms except our landing party.
SPOCK,Catspaw,"No cloud formations, no bodies of water, no changes in surface temperature."
SPOCK,Catspaw,"Under these conditions, fog is highly unlikely, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,According to our transporter co-ordinates this is the exact location from which Jackson was beamed up to the ship.
SPOCK,Catspaw,No indications of.
SPOCK,Catspaw,"A moment, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,Picking up life form readings.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Twenty four degrees mark seven.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Range one thirty seven point one six metres.
SPOCK,Catspaw,"Multiple readings, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,"No change, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,"Very bad poetry, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,What we've just seen is not real.
SPOCK,Catspaw,"However, on azimuth twenty four, at just over one hundred metres, there are definitely life forms."
SPOCK,Catspaw,"Erratic, confused, but definitely registering."
SPOCK,Catspaw,"This is the source of the life form readings, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,"They're inside, somewhere."
SPOCK,Catspaw,"I would say not, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,There's no indication of anything that would cause such interference.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside.
SPOCK,Catspaw,"Trick or treat, Captain?"
SPOCK,Catspaw,That would seem to be in order.
SPOCK,Catspaw,The readings would so indicate.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Yes.
SPOCK,Catspaw,"I am undamaged, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,"I do not know, Captain, but these things do exist."
SPOCK,Catspaw,They are real.
SPOCK,Catspaw,As if someone knew what it was that terrifies man most on an instinctive level.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Neither did Jackson just before he collapsed.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Mapping expeditions have charted this solar system before.
SPOCK,Catspaw,There never have been any life forms on Pyris Seven.
SPOCK,Catspaw,There are ancient Earth legends about wizards and their familiars.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Demons in animal forms sent by Satan to serve the wizard.
SPOCK,Catspaw,"I do not create the legend, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,I merely report it.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Ingenious.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Mind probing?
SPOCK,Catspaw,Hypnosis?
SPOCK,Catspaw,Telepathy?
SPOCK,Catspaw,"Not entirely, no."
SPOCK,Catspaw,Telepathy doesn't imply control and I assure you that I have full control over your friends.
SPOCK,Catspaw,"Twenty two minutes, seventeen seconds."
SPOCK,Catspaw,I'm sure we'll find out shortly.
SPOCK,Catspaw,"Jim, all of these things that we've seen."
SPOCK,Catspaw,"To an Earthman like yourself, they must seem quite familiar."
SPOCK,Catspaw,Precisely.
SPOCK,Catspaw,I refer you to the psychological theory of the racial subconscious.
SPOCK,Catspaw,"The universal myths, symbols."
SPOCK,Catspaw,And dungeons and castles and black cats.
SPOCK,Catspaw,They all belong to the twilight world of consciousness.
SPOCK,Catspaw,And they missed.
SPOCK,Catspaw,They reached basically only the subconscious.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Korob seemed puzzled by your reaction to the environment he'd provided.
SPOCK,Catspaw,And not to have a knowledge of our scientific methods is most unlikely for any life form we've met in this galaxy.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Evidently something totally alien in all respects.
SPOCK,Catspaw,"I, too, am at a loss at this time to suggest a course of action."
SPOCK,Catspaw,You came in a ship?
SPOCK,Catspaw,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Racial memories.
SPOCK,Catspaw,"The cat is the most ruthless, most terrifying of animals, as far back as the sabre-toothed tiger."
SPOCK,Catspaw,"Ready when you are, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,"Quickly, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,"Captain, a bit more alacrity, if you please."
SPOCK,Catspaw,Captain.
SPOCK,Catspaw,Jim!
SPOCK,Catspaw,"Fortuitous, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,And now that we have them all together?
SPOCK,Catspaw,"(the cat arrives) A most unpleasant situation, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,If only your phaser had some power.
SPOCK,Catspaw,"Don't let her touch the wand, Captain."
SPOCK,Catspaw,Jim!
SPOCK,Catspaw,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Catspaw,A life form totally alien to our galaxy.
SPOCK,Catspaw,If we could preserve and study this
JACKSON,Catspaw,Jackson to Enterprise.
JACKSON,Catspaw,"One to beam up, Enterprise."
JACKSON,Catspaw,"I'm ready to beam up, sir."
KYLE,Catspaw,"Ready, sir."
MCCOY,Catspaw,"What's on, Jim?"
MCCOY,Catspaw,The man is dead.
MCCOY,Catspaw,Scott and Sulu?
MCCOY,Catspaw,"Whatever this stuff is, it's getting thicker."
MCCOY,Catspaw,Suppose that has anything to do with the interference?
MCCOY,Catspaw,Listen.
MCCOY,Catspaw,"Now, what do you think that"
MCCOY,Catspaw,"That was a pretty real illusion, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Catspaw,Jim.
MCCOY,Catspaw,Is this how we lost contact with the first landing party?
MCCOY,Catspaw,"Then it would affect Spock's tricorder too, wouldn't it?"
MCCOY,Catspaw,"Three witches, what appears to be a castle and a black cat."
MCCOY,Catspaw,"Dust, cobwebs."
MCCOY,Catspaw,Halloween is right.
MCCOY,Catspaw,You were saying something about trick or treat.
MCCOY,Catspaw,Could this be an Earth parallel development of some sort?
MCCOY,Catspaw,"They appear to be drugged, Jim."
MCCOY,Catspaw,Look at their eyes.
MCCOY,Catspaw,Hardly blink at all.
MCCOY,Catspaw,They're going to release us.
MCCOY,Catspaw,That cat.
MCCOY,Catspaw,Familiars?
MCCOY,Catspaw,He doesn't know about trick or treat.
MCCOY,Catspaw,We're not hungry.
MCCOY,Catspaw,These look real.
MCCOY,Catspaw,Tests?
MCCOY,Catspaw,You kept Scott and Sulu as catspaws to lure us down here.
MCCOY,Catspaw,How'd you know we'd come?
MCCOY,Catspaw,"What happened, Jim?"
MCCOY,Catspaw,Too late.
MCCOY,Catspaw,"All of this, just an illusion."
KOROB,Catspaw,"(from the mouth of Jackson) Captain Kirk, can you hear me?"
KOROB,Catspaw,There is a curse on your ship.
KOROB,Catspaw,Leave this place or you will all die.
KOROB,Catspaw,Stop!
KOROB,Catspaw,Where did your race get this ridiculous predilection for resistance?
KOROB,Catspaw,"You examine any object, you question everything."
KOROB,Catspaw,Is it not enough to accept what is?
KOROB,Catspaw,"NO, not mindless."
KOROB,Catspaw,"These two are merely controlled, Captain Kirk."
KOROB,Catspaw,"Oh, yes, we know who you are."
KOROB,Catspaw,All of you.
KOROB,Catspaw,"(to the cat) Don't we, my precious?"
KOROB,Catspaw,My name is Korob.
KOROB,Catspaw,"And as for bringing you here, it was you who quite contrarily insisted upon coming."
KOROB,Catspaw,You were warned to stay away.
KOROB,Catspaw,Mumbo-jumbo?
KOROB,Catspaw,(the cat meows as if explaining) Oh!
KOROB,Catspaw,"Oh, no, I assure you it was not that, Captain."
KOROB,Catspaw,It is of no importance that we are not native to this planet.
KOROB,Catspaw,(meow) Oh!
KOROB,Catspaw,"I'm told that I've been an inattentive host, gentlemen."
KOROB,Catspaw,You will join me for something to refresh yourselves.
KOROB,Catspaw,"You are the different one, Mister Spock."
KOROB,Catspaw,You do not think like the others.
KOROB,Catspaw,There are no colours to your patterns of logic.
KOROB,Catspaw,There's only black and white.
KOROB,Catspaw,"You see all this around you, yet you do not believe."
KOROB,Catspaw,"I do not understand that reference, therefore it also is of no importance."
KOROB,Catspaw,"Gentlemen, I can be most hospitable."
KOROB,Catspaw,Do be seated.
KOROB,Catspaw,But I insist.
KOROB,Catspaw,"For the moment, merely that you eat and enjoy."
KOROB,Catspaw,"Oh, Doctor, do try the wine."
KOROB,Catspaw,You'll find it excellent.
KOROB,Catspaw,Hopefully I can change that attitude.
KOROB,Catspaw,"They are, I assure you."
KOROB,Catspaw,"Diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires."
KOROB,Catspaw,All the crystalline forms that you cherish above all things.
KOROB,Catspaw,A fortune of them for each of you if you leave here without further inquiry.
KOROB,Catspaw,Valueless?
KOROB,Catspaw,I don't understand.
KOROB,Catspaw,I read
KOROB,Catspaw,You are most unpredictable.
KOROB,Catspaw,Perhaps I have made a small mistake.
KOROB,Catspaw,"Nevertheless, you have passed the tests."
KOROB,Catspaw,Yes.
KOROB,Catspaw,"Our analysis of you may have been in some small way in error, but you were warned to stay away and yet you came to save your comrades."
KOROB,Catspaw,That proves loyalty.
KOROB,Catspaw,Your bravery was tested and you did not frighten.
KOROB,Catspaw,"And despite my failure with these bright baubles, I perceive that you cannot be bribed."
KOROB,Catspaw,In many ways you are quite admirable.
KOROB,Catspaw,(meow) Quite right.
KOROB,Catspaw,"Go at once, yes."
KOROB,Catspaw,"Gentlemen, my colleague."
KOROB,Catspaw,Sylvia.
KOROB,Catspaw,Don't.
KOROB,Catspaw,"Sylvia, don't."
KOROB,Catspaw,"Captain, you've seen something of our science."
KOROB,Catspaw,Now tell us about yours.
KOROB,Catspaw,"What would you name it, Captain?"
KOROB,Catspaw,"Yes, we can change the molecular structure"
KOROB,Catspaw,"Oh, we didn't have to know."
KOROB,Catspaw,They knew.
KOROB,Catspaw,"Some time, Captain."
KOROB,Catspaw,Quite some time.
KOROB,Catspaw,"There will be no search party, Captain Kirk."
KOROB,Catspaw,"An impenetrable force field around your ship, Captain."
KOROB,Catspaw,"It will not hinder orbit, but your people are prisoners within it."
KOROB,Catspaw,Take them to their cell.
KOROB,Catspaw,(gives the phaser to Scott)
KOROB,Catspaw,You forget what we were sent here for.
KOROB,Catspaw,You're a traitor.
KOROB,Catspaw,We have a duty to the old ones.
KOROB,Catspaw,You're cruel.
KOROB,Catspaw,You torture our specimens.
KOROB,Catspaw,You're wrong!
KOROB,Catspaw,You're discarding everything we live by.
KOROB,Catspaw,I have the power.
KOROB,Catspaw,"This is not ended, Sylvia."
KOROB,Catspaw,"I've released the model of your ship from the crystal, although they would have freed themselves soon."
KOROB,Catspaw,It's difficult to control so many things in so little time.
KOROB,Catspaw,(hands over phaser and communicator) Here.
KOROB,Catspaw,You must go before she finds the weapon is missing.
KOROB,Catspaw,They're not your men anymore.
KOROB,Catspaw,They belong to Sylvia.
KOROB,Catspaw,I can no longer control them or her.
KOROB,Catspaw,She's irrational.
KOROB,Catspaw,"The strain of adopting to your form, the insatiable desire for sensation and experience."
KOROB,Catspaw,She's a great danger and it was not necessary.
KOROB,Catspaw,We could have entered your galaxy in peace.
KOROB,Catspaw,We used the transmuter.
KOROB,Catspaw,There's no time to explain now.
KOROB,Catspaw,She means to destroy us all.
KOROB,Catspaw,There might still be a chance.
KOROB,Catspaw,Quickly.
KOROB,Catspaw,Come.
KOROB,Catspaw,I think I can stop her.
KOROB,Catspaw,It's my problem.
KOROB,Catspaw,She's one of my kind.
KOROB,Catspaw,Come quickly.
KOROB,Catspaw,No!
KOROB,Catspaw,Get back.
KOROB,Catspaw,Get back.
KOROB,Catspaw,Get back!
KOROB,Catspaw,Get back!
KOROB,Catspaw,Get back!
KOROB,Catspaw,Go.
KOROB,Catspaw,Go!
KOROB,Catspaw,"(He dies, and Kirk picks up his wand.)"
DESALLE,Catspaw,"Report, Mister."
DESALLE,Catspaw,"Relay, Lieutenant."
DESALLE,Catspaw,Check for malfunctions.
DESALLE,Catspaw,Nobody just disappears.
DESALLE,Catspaw,They may have encountered a magnetic field or some other obstruction.
DESALLE,Catspaw,"Mister Chekov, recalibrate your sensors."
DESALLE,Catspaw,If you need help
DESALLE,Catspaw,"Lieutenant Uhura, continue in your efforts to break through that static interference."
DESALLE,Catspaw,We know they're down there.
DESALLE,Catspaw,I want them found.
DESALLE,Catspaw,"The temperature, sir."
DESALLE,Catspaw,It keeps rising.
DESALLE,Catspaw,"Reading, Mister."
DESALLE,Catspaw,"We've already done it, Captain."
DESALLE,Catspaw,It had no effect.
DESALLE,Catspaw,We're cooking up here.
DESALLE,Catspaw,"Lieutenant, try to raise the captain again."
DESALLE,Catspaw,"Wave length analysis, Mister Chekov?"
DESALLE,Catspaw,"All right, but it's there and it's real."
DESALLE,Catspaw,"If it's real, it can be affected."
DESALLE,Catspaw,"Engineering, stand by to divert all power systems to the outer hull."
DESALLE,Catspaw,Prepare impulse engines for generation of maximum heat directed as ordered.
DESALLE,Catspaw,"Maybe we can't break it, but I'll bet you credits to navy beans we can put a dent in it."
DESALLE,Catspaw,"It's there, Lieutenant."
DESALLE,Catspaw,"Keep it up, Mister Chekov."
DESALLE,Catspaw,"Channel the entire output of reactors one, two, and three into the relay stations."
DESALLE,Catspaw,"Whatever it is, it's starting to weaken."
CHEKOV,Catspaw,I am only picking up physical impulses from the three of them.
CHEKOV,Catspaw,"As far as instruments can make out, there is nothing else down there that's alive."
CHEKOV,Catspaw,"They're gone, Mister DeSalle."
CHEKOV,Catspaw,The captain and the others simply stopped registering.
CHEKOV,Catspaw,"I did, sir, as soon as it happened."
CHEKOV,Catspaw,"I can do it, sir."
CHEKOV,Catspaw,I'm not that green.
CHEKOV,Catspaw,It's up sixty degrees in the past thirty seconds.
CHEKOV,Catspaw,"We're burning up, sir."
CHEKOV,Catspaw,"Temperature is almost back to normal, dropping down fast."
CHEKOV,Catspaw,"It's some kind of a force field, sir, but not like any other I've ever heard of before."
CHEKOV,Catspaw,It's not coming from anywhere.
CHEKOV,Catspaw,It's simply all around us.
CHEKOV,Catspaw,"It will not analyse, sir."
CHEKOV,Catspaw,"It was that electrical field we set up, Mister DeSalle, that dent you wanted."
CHEKOV,Catspaw,"It's not much, but it is a start."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and Captain Kirk."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You wanted to know what we did to your men.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Actually it's a simple matter for us to probe the minds of creatures like yourself.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"You like to think of yourselves as complex creatures, but you're flawed."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,One gains admittance to your minds through many levels.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You have too many to keep track of yourselves.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,There are unguarded entrances to any human mind.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Put that weapon down!
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"Captain, it seems so foolish of you to insist on demonstrations."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,(She holds up a model Enterprise on a chain) In the mythology of your race this is called sympathetic magic.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"Jackson, the crew member who returned to the ship."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You wondered what killed him.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I made an image of him.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,In the essence of my thoughts the image was Jackson.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"And when I killed the image and knew that it was dead, he died."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Your communicator.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"(it appears on the table) Now, signal your ship."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"You can relax now, Captain."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Your ship is safe.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"Korob, you talk too much."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Enough of this!
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You will tell us what we want to know.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"I would advise you to co-operate, Captain."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"Forcible extraction of the information we wish from you is not complicated, but it is extremely painful and it has a certain draining effect."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Wait.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,The doctor will stay.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"Your turn will be next, Captain."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,It makes little difference.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Take them out of here.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I forget nothing.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"I'm not a puppet, Korob, like you."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You are a fool.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,We have nothing like this and I like it.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"To touch, to feel to understand the idea of luxury I like it."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,And I don't intend to leave it.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,What do they know of sensations?
SYLVIA,Catspaw,This is a new world.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"And that, too, is a new sensation."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I find it stimulating.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I live by my own decisions.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"You're a weak fool, Korob."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,But you're afraid to use it.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Don't threaten me.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"I can squash you and that would be an interesting sensation, yes."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I find I like these new sensations.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Don't try to push me.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Captain.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,It's time for our talk.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"Korob, leave us alone and take these men with you."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"But it may end soon, old man."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"There's no real damage to the mind, Captain, simply a drain of knowledge and will."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Why should I?
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"But you're mistaken, Captain."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I am a woman now.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I come from a world without sensation as you and I now know it.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,It excites me.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I want more.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Because you have knowledge which I lack.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,but were our abilities put together.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"Tell me about power, Captain."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,How does it feel?
SYLVIA,Catspaw,He is a fool.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I'll do without him.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,But you?
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Why do I find you different?
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Why would it be so difficult to dispose of you?
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"No, not that, not for you."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,What I want is a joining.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,My mind to yours willingly.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Think of the secrets you could learn.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Think of the power that would be yours.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"Anything you can imagine, I can give you."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Then everything would be ours together.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I've never conceived of the idea of togetherness before.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,It excites me.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You excite me.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Why?
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You find me beautiful?
SYLVIA,Catspaw,But I can be many women.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,(now she's blonde teen jail-bait) You like what you see.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,(a platinum blonde in a loose cat-suit) or do you prefer me as I was?
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Nothing.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"They're like, like feathers in the wind without the transmuter."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,The source.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You will learn.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I will teach you later.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Later.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,It gives only form.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You're teaching me substance.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,My home is here with you.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,A billion worlds of sensation to pick and choose.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You are using me.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You hold me in your arms and there is no fire in your mind.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You're trying to deceive me!
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"It's here, (the crystal) like words on a page."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You are using me.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You will be swept away.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"You, your men, your ship, your worlds!"
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"You're very clever, Captain."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,More so than I'd imagined.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"Clever, resourceful and handsome."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I've never played games.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Give it to me.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"No, not the source."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,It's merely an amplifier.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,The mind is the source.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"Mine is simple, but yours has the key but you don't know how to use it."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"It is not too late, Captain James Kirk."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Come with me.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I'll teach you.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You'll teach me.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"We need your dreams, your ambition."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,"With them, I can build."
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Give me the transmuter.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,You fool.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Don't you know what you're giving up?
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Everything that your species finds desirable.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Look at me.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I am a woman.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I am all women.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,(holding a phaser) Korob was wrong.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,I didn't destroy all your weapons.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Give me the transmuter.
SYLVIA,Catspaw,Give it to me!
SCOTT,Catspaw,Everything's vanished.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"We have reached projected point three, Captain."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Adjust to new
course two oh one mark one five."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Captain.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Will you check your automatic scanner, please?"
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Nor have I.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Heading directly toward us at warp speed.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Vaguely like a cloud of ionised hydrogen, but with strong
erratic electrical impulses."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Helm does not answer, Captain."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Cut, Captain."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Now on course nine eight mark one two, heading directly toward
Gamma Canaris region."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Gravity is similar to Earth.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Most unusual in view of its size.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,The bulk of the body seems to be iron and nickel.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"More than an
asteroid."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Like a small planetoid, I should say."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Possibly a remnant of a
planet breakup."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Totally suitable for human life.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Most unusual.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Unlikely.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"In fact, Captain, I would say quite
impossible."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Precisely.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Obviously.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,The ionised cloud.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Correct.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Which seems to be on the surface of this body at the moment.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,You say we'll be unable to get the ship to function again?
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,You don't mind if we continue to try?
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"You built this, Mister Cochrane?"
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Not bad.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Captain, Doctor."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"We imagined nothing, Mister Cochrane."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"There was an entity out
there and I suspect it was the same entity which brought us here."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Please explain.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,You were injured?
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"I prefer to reserve judgment on that part of your story, sir."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Meanwhile, would you please explain exactly what this Companion of
yours is?"
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"The name of Zefram Cochrane is revered throughout the known
galaxy."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Planets were named after him.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Great universities, cities."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"True, his body was never found."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"If so, you wear your age very well."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Captain.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"These instruments, they date from the time indicated."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"From your ship, Mister Cochrane?"
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,You ask me to find a weapon.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Do you intend to destroy it?
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Quite clear, Captain."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Yes.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Quite all right, Doctor."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,A most fascinating thing happened.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Apparently, the Companion imparted to me a rather quaint, old-fashioned
electric shock of respectable voltage."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Evidently.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Unquestionably, a large part of its substance is
simple electricity."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Quite correct, Doctor."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Put this in the proximity of the Companion, throw this switch,
and it will scramble every electrical impulse the creature can produce."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,It cannot fail.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,We may simply render it powerless.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"There is some risk, Captain."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"We do not know the extent of its
powers."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,All right.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Yes, Captain?"
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,The translator is for use with more congruent life forms.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,It is possible.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,If I could widen its pattern of reception
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Then it translates its findings into English.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Quite ready, Captain."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Yes.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,The matter of gender could change the entire situation.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Then it is not a zookeeper.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,This is a marvellous opportunity to add to our knowledge.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Ask it
about its nature, its history."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,A chance like this may never come again.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"It could tell us so
much."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Her attitude when she approaches you is profoundly different
than when she contacts us."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Her appearance is soft, gentle."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Her voice is
melodic, pleasing."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"I do not totally understand the emotion, but it
obviously exists."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,The Companion loves you.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Your highly emotional reaction is most illogical.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Your
relationship with the Companion has for one hundred and fifty years
been emotionally satisfying,
eminently practical, and totally harmless."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"It may indeed have been
quite beneficial."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,A totally parochial attitude.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"But she or it is inhuman, Captain."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"You cannot expect her to
react like a human."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Companion, you do not have the power to create life."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Commissioner Hedford was dying.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"Then you are both here, in the one body?"
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,Not coming from a human being.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"You are, after all, essentially
irrational."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,"But you will age, both of you."
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,There will be no immortality.
SPOCK,Metamorphosis,You'll both grow old here and finally die.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"How is she, Doc?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Commissioner, I can assure you that once we reach the Enterprise,
with its medical facilities, we'll have you back to your job in time
for you to prevent that war."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"In exactly four hours, twenty one minutes, Commissioner."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Yes?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,That's odd.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,I've never seen anything like that before.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Staying right with us.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Sensor readings, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,We've got it.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Neither do the pods.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Communications are dead.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Building overload.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Cut all power relays.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"You already know as much as we do, Miss Hedford."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Whatever that
thing is outside, it's yanked us off course from the Enterprise."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"I know, Bones, but there's nothing I can do about it."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Miss Hedford, we'll do what we can, when we can."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"At the moment,
we're helpless."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You might as well sit back and enjoy the ride.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Enterprise, this is the Galileo."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Come in, please, come in."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Enterprise, this is the Galileo."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Come in, please."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,It's no good.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"We're
not transmitting."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Bones?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Spock?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"All right, we get out and get up."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Issue phasers.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Bones, maintain
full alert."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Commissioner, you'll stay inside."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,That's a very good question.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,I wish I could answer it.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,All right.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Let's go.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Take a look around, Bones."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Nothing wrong and nothing works.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,There must be a reason.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Let's look a little further.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Bones, get a physiological reading on that, whatever it is."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,We're real enough.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,From the Federation.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"I'm Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,(they shake hands) This is my first officer Mister Spock.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Chief Surgeon Leonard McCoy.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Oh, and excuse me, Assistant Federation Commissioner Hedford."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Mister Cochrane.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"We were forced off our course and taken here by
some force we couldn't identify."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"What about you, Cochrane?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,How did you get here?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"If you don't mind, Mister Cochrane, I'd like more than just a
statement that you were marooned here."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"It's a long way off the beaten
path."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Yes, she is."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,And you've been out of circulation quite a while.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,The principles may be new to you.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Mister Spock, why don't you explain
our methods of propulsion to Mister Cochrane?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,I've noticed something else.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,He looks familiar.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"I can't quite place him, but."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,What about Miss Hedford?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Take Cochrane up on his offer.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"All the comforts of home indeed, Mister
Cochrane."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Where'd you get the antiques?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Not that much.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Yes, I know."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,It means we're running out of time.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,What was that?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"You'll find I have a very low tolerance level where the safety of
my people are concerned."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"We find you out here, where no human has any
business being."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,We were virtually hijacked in space and brought here.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Now I'm not just requesting an explanation, Mister."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,I'm demanding one.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,The what?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You seem perfectly all right now.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,What was the matter?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You were what?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Mister Cochrane, do you have a first name?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Zefram Cochrane of Alpha Centuri, the discoverer of the space
warp?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Isn't your story a little improbable, Mister Cochrane?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You say this Companion found you and rejuvenated you?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"What were
you doing in space at the age of eighty seven?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,How long do we have?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Mister Cochrane, you say you were brought here a hundred and
fifty years ago?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You don't look over thirty five.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You say you can communicate with it.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Perhaps you can find out
what we're doing here."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You wouldn't mind telling us?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,I already don't like it.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You mean you brought us here?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Spock, run additional tricorder readings."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Learn anything you can.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Find me a weapon to use against this thing.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"I intend to do whatever's necessary to get us off this planet and
Commissioner Hedford to the hospital."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"If the Companion stands in the
way,
then we push it out of the way."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Clear, Spock?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Very well.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You have your orders.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"(Spock leaves) Mister Cochrane,
if you left here, what would happen to you?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Do you want to leave here?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,We're on a thousand planets and spreading out.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"We cross fantastic
distances and everything's alive, Cochrane."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Life everywhere.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"We
estimate there are millions of planets with intelligent life."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"We
haven't begun to map them."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Interesting?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"It's all out there waiting for you, but we'll need your help to
get away."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"You seem to think this Companion of yours can
do almost anything."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Could it cure her?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,How do you communicate with it?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,We've got to try.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,We're helpless.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,See if it can do something.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,How do you do it?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Bones, what do you make of that?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Exactly what I think.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Not exactly like a pet owner speaking to a
beloved animal, would you
say?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Agreed.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,More like love.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Well?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Then she'll die.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"It troubles you, Cochrane?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,It's also keeping you prisoner.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"We're getting out of here, Cochrane."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Face up to it.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"I'll do
anything I have to to save all of our lives."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Please.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Outside.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Nor it ours.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Now.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Yeah.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Cochrane got it off of us, but I don't know whether he did us a
favour or not."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,How do you fight a thing like that?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"I've got a ship up there
somewhere, responsibility for four lives here, one of them dying
because of me."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"I'm in command, Bones."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,It makes it my fault.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"How do you fight a
thing like that?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Spock.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,The universal translator on the shuttlecraft.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"We can try that,
talk to that thing."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Adjust it, change it."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"The trouble with immortality is it's
boring."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Adjusting the translator will give you something to do.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Right down your alley, Spock."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Get it here and get to work.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"That
thing is still out there."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Better go that way.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Any change?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"There are certain universal ideas and concepts common to all
intelligent life."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"This device instantaneously compares the frequency of
brainwave patterns, selects those ideas and concepts it recognises, and
then provides the necessary grammar."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"With a voice or the approximation of whatever the creature is on
the sending end."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Not one hundred percent efficient, but nothing ever
is."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Ready, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Mister Cochrane, call the Companion."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Companion.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,(It leaves Cochrane) We wish to talk to you.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Feminine.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,No doubt about it.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,I'm way ahead of you.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,No.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,A lover.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Companion.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"It is wrong to keep us here against our
will."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"One of us will cease to exist if we don't get her to a place
where we can care for her."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Companion, try to understand."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"It is the nature of our species to
be free, just as it is your nature to stay here."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"We will cease to exist
in captivity."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,This isn't a classroom.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,I'm trying to get us out of here.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,This isn't the time.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Companion, what you offer us is not
continuation."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,It is non=existence.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,We will cease to exist.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Even the man
will cease to exist."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,We didn't.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"The idea of male and female are universal constants, Cochrane."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,There's no doubt about it.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,The Companion is female.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,What are you complaining about?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,It kept you alive.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Companion, do you love the man?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Is he important to you, more important than anything?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Is he as
though he were a part of you?"
KIRK,Metamorphosis,He will not continue.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,He will cease to exist.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"By your feeling for
him, you are condemning him to an existence he will find unbearable."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"He
will cease to exist."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You speak of his body.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,I speak of his spirit.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Companion, inside
the shelter, a female of our species is dying."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,She will not continue.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,That is what will happen to the man unless you release all of us.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You take away all obstacles.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Without them to strengthen us, we will
weaken and die."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You regard the man only as a toy.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"You amuse yourself
with him."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,But you can't really love him.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"You haven't the slightest
knowledge of love, the total union of two people."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"You are the
Companion."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,He is the man.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You are two different things.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You can't join.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,You can't love.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"You may keep him here forever, but you will always be
separate, apart from him."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Try to convince her of the hopelessness of it.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Love sometimes
expresses itself in sacrifice."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"I thought maybe if she loved him, she'd
let him go."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,I tried.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Bones?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,What?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Bones?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,We?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Spock, check out the shuttlecraft."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Engine, communications,
everything."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Go ahead, Cochrane We have a few things to do."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Perfectly all right.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Can you get a fix on us.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Very good.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,I'll continue transmitting.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Assume
standard orbit when you arrive."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,We'll transport up in the shuttlecraft.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Interesting story, Scotty."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"I can't tell you
now because, quite frankly, I don't know how it's going to end."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Kirk
out."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Stand by, Scotty."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"The Enterprise is waiting, Mister Cochrane."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Think it over, Mister Cochrane."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"There's a whole galaxy out there
waiting to honour you."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,Are you sure?
KIRK,Metamorphosis,All the best.
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Not a word, Mister Cochrane."
KIRK,Metamorphosis,"Well, I'm sure the Federation can find another woman somewhere
who'll stop that war."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,(offering a drink) Jim.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,No change.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Now really, Commissioner, you can't blame the Starfleet."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Sakuro's disease is extremely rare.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"The chances of anyone
contracting it are literally billions to one."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Jim, we've got to get Miss Hedford to the Enterprise."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Her
condition."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Some krypton, argon, neon."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Temperature seventy five degrees Fahrenheit.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Practically identical to
Earth atmosphere."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Jim, I just took a tricording sweep, and I got the same readings
almost as Spock got when we were pulled off course."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"I think so, only it reads here on the surface with us."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"It's in
that direction, and it doesn't read solid."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"It's more unstable, tenuous,
like a collection of gases."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Pleasure.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"He's human, Jim."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Everything checks out perfectly.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Talks a lot, but he doesn't say much."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,What's that?
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Familiar?
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Now that you mention it, he does."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"No temperature yet, but we've got to get under way soon, Jim."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"I
guarantee you, it will develop."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,What are we going to do?
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Do you feel hot?
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,It was quite a hike here.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,You're tired.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Just take it easy for a
while."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Temperature, Captain."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,First sign.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,That's a pretty far out story.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,But that's impossible.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Zefram Cochrane died a hundred and fifty
years ago."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,How do you feel?
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,You're running a little temperature.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Perhaps you should lie
down."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,All right.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Try to relax.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Jim, it's started, the fever."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"It's over
a hundred, and it's climbing."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"A matter of hours, that's all."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Almost a symbiosis of some kind, a sort of joining."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"No, it's more than that."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Are you all right?
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Spock!
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Are you all right?
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,It attacked you?
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Oh, yes."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"I'm not a scientist or a physicist, Mister Spock, but
am I correct in assuming that anything that generates electricity can
be shorted out?"
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"We understand how you feel, Mister Cochrane, but it has to be
done."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Stop it!
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,You're killing them!
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Stop it, please!"
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Stop it!
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"You're
choking them!"
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Let them go.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,You're choking them!
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Stop it!
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"You all right, Jim?"
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Spock?
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,What kind of talk is that?
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,It isn't your fault.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Maybe you're a soldier so often that you forget you're also
trained to be a diplomat."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,Why not try a carrot instead of a stick?
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Yes, for the worse."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,You don't?
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,A blind man could see it with a cane.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"You're not a
pet."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,You're not a specimen kept in a cage.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,You're a lover.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,There's nothing disgusting about it.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"It's just another life
form, that's all."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,You get used to those things.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Right here, Miss Hedford."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,You just rest.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"What did you hope to gain by that, Jim?"
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,I don't understand it.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,She's not sick at all.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,She's perfectly healthy.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Heart like a hammer, respiration
normal, blood pressure normal."
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,This is medically impossible.
MCCOY,Metamorphosis,"Jim, what about that war on Epsilon Canaris Three?"
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Small thanks to the Starfleet.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,I should've received the proper inoculations ahead of time.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"I was sent to Epsilon Canaris Three to prevent a war, Doctor."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"Thanks to the inefficiency of the medical branch of the Starfleet, I've
been forced to leave before my job was done."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"How soon will we rendezvous with that ship of yours, Captain?"
NANCY,Metamorphosis,What's happening?
NANCY,Metamorphosis,I demand to know.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,I insist you make your scheduled rendezvous with the Enterprise.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"Just how long am I supposed to stay inside, Captain?"
NANCY,Metamorphosis,How perceptive of you to notice I needed one.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Must you keep it so terribly hot in here?
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"I feel infuriated, deeply put upon, and absolutely outraged."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"I'll rest later, Doctor."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Thank you.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Terrible.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,How should I feel?
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"Doctor, will you please just leave me alone."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,It's the heat.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,No!
NANCY,Metamorphosis,No!
NANCY,Metamorphosis,No!
NANCY,Metamorphosis,That's disgusting!
NANCY,Metamorphosis,We're not animals!
NANCY,Metamorphosis,No!
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"Oh, no!"
NANCY,Metamorphosis,It's inhuman!
NANCY,Metamorphosis,No!
NANCY,Metamorphosis,No!
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Doctor.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Doctor.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,I heard him.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,He was loved and he resents it.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,No.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,I don't want to die.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"I've been good at my job, but I've
never been loved."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Never.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,What kind of life is that?
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"Not to be loved,
never to have shown love?"
NANCY,Metamorphosis,And he runs away from love.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,(cries)
NANCY,Metamorphosis,(standing in the doorway) Zefram Cochrane.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,We understand.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,We are here.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Both of us.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"Those you knew as the Commissioner and the
Companion."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,We are both here.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,That is for the Maker of all things.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,That part of us was too weak to hold on.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"In a moment, there
would have been no continuing."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Now we're together.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,We are one.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"Zefram, we frighten you."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,We've never frightened you before.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Loneliness.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,This is loneliness.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"Oh, what a bitter thing."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"Oh, Zefram,
it's so sad."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"How do you bear it, this loneliness?"
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"That will not be necessary, Captain."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"Your vehicle will operate
as before, so will the communications device."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,We could do nothing now to stop you.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"You said we would not know
love because we were not human."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Now we are human.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"We'll know the change
of days."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,We will know death.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"But to touch the hand of man, nothing is
as important."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Part of me understands.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Part does not.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,But it pleases me.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"Oh, let me walk, Zefram."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Let me feel the earth against my feet.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,Let me feel the warmth of the sun on my face.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,You beside me.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"Let me
feel these things."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"I can't go with you, Zefram."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,My life emanates from this place.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"If I should leave it for more
than a tiny march of days, I'll cease to exist."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"I must return, even as
you must consume matter to maintain your life."
NANCY,Metamorphosis,The joy of this hour.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,I am pleased.
NANCY,Metamorphosis,"You must be free, Zefram Cochrane."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Hello!
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Hello!
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Hello!
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Are you real?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I mean, I'm not imagining you, am I?"
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You speak English.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Earth people?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,The F?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Well, it doesn't matter."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I'm Cochrane.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I've been
marooned here who knows how long."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"If you only knew how good it is to
see you."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,And a woman.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,A beautiful one at that.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"You're a Vulcan, aren't you?"
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Doctor.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Ma'am.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You're food to a starving man.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,All of you.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Hey, that's
a nice ship."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Simple and clean.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Been trying to get her to go again?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Well, forget it."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,It won't work.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Well, I wouldn't know anything about that."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Not a chance.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,There's some sort of dampening field down here.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Power systems don't work.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Take my word for it.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Go right ahead.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You've got plenty of time.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Marooned, I told you."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Look, we'll have lots of time to learn
about each other."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I have a small place over that way.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"All the comforts
of home."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I can even offer you a hot bath.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,That's right.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,That's why I'm so glad to see you.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Look, I'll
tell you everything you want to know, but not here."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Your ship is sure a
beauty."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Yes.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I had tools and supplies left over from my crash.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Not Earth, but it's livable."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I grow vegetables in the fields
over that next ridge."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Come on in.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You mean my instruments?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I imagine things have changed a lot
since I crashed."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,The temperature's a constant seventy two degrees.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Let me get
you something cool to drink."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Well, sometimes the light plays tricks on you."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"You'd be
surprised what I've imagined I've seen around here sometimes."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,There's nothing to explain.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,All right.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,It was the Companion.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,That's what I call it.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"As a matter of fact, Captain, I didn't
crash here."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I was brought here in my disabled ship.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I was almost dead.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,The Companion saved my life.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I was dying, Mister Spock."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I was an old man.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Well, I don't know how it did it, but the Companion
rejuvenated me, made me young again, like I am now."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I told you, I don't know what it is."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"It exists, it lives, and
I can communicate with it."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Zefram.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"That's right, Captain."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"No, it's true."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I was eighty seven years old when I came here.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I was tired, Captain."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I was going to die, and I wanted to die
in space."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,That's all.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"You're looking at it, Mister Spock."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I haven't aged.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,The Companion sees to that.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I cannibalised it.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"The food, water, gardens, everything else
I need the Companion gives me."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Apparently, it creates it out of the
native elements."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I already know.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You won't like it.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You're here to keep me company.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"No, the Companion did."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I told it I'd die of loneliness.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I
thought it would release me."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Instead, it brought you here."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I'd begin to age again, normally."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Believe me, Captain, immortality consists largely of boredom."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,What's it like out there in the galaxy?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"How would you like to sleep for a hundred and fifty years and
wake up in a new world?"
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You've got it.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I said it was very powerful.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I don't know.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"It's on a non-verbal level, but I usually get my message
across."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I just sort of clear my mind and it comes.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Yes.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"It kind of drains me a little, but I'm all right."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,The Companion can't do anything to help Miss Hedford.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"If there's anything I could do to help, I would, and I will,
but we can expect nothing from the Companion."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,The Companion saved my life.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"It's taken care of me all these
years."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,We've been very close in a way that's hard to explain.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I suppose
I even have an affection for it."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I don't want it killed.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,But you don't know.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You could kill it.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I won't stand for
that."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I suppose from your point of view, you're right."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,All right.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You want me to contact it?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,What was it they used to call it?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,The Judas goat?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,(leaves)
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,What's the theory behind this device?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You mean it speaks?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Captain, why did you build that
translator with a feminine voice?"
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,But I heard
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I don't understand.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I'm a what?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Do you know what you're saying?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"For all these years, I've let
something as alien as that crawl around inside me, into my mind, my
feelings."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,That thing fed on me.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,It used me.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,It's disgusting.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You're as bad as it is.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Is this what the future holds?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Men who have no notion of
decency or morality?"
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Maybe I'm a hundred and fifty years out of style,
but I'm not going to be fodder for any inhuman monster."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,(leaves)
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,It's useless.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I know.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,It's her.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Don't you understand?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,It's the Companion.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You're letting us go?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You're very beautiful.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I could explain many things.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Everything will be an eye-opener to you.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"There's a thousand
planets out there, a thousand races, and I'll show everything to you,
soon as I learn my way around again."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Maybe I can make up a little for
everything you've done for me."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Of course you can.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You have to.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You gave up everything to be human?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"But even if you stay
here, you'll eventually die."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Well, I can't just fly away and leave you here."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"You saved my life, took care of me."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,You loved me.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I never
understood."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I do now.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I can't take her away from here.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"If I do, she'll die."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"If I
leave her, she'll die of loneliness."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I owe everything to her.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I can't
leave her."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I love her.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,Is that surprising?
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I have honours enough.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,That's been happening to men and women for a long time.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"I've
got the feeling it's one of the pleasanter things about being human, as
long as you grow old together."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,There's plenty of water here.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"The climate's good for growing
things."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,I might try to plant a fig tree.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"A man's entitled to that,
isn't he?"
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"It isn't gratitude, Captain."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Now that I see her, touch her, I
know that I love her."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,We'll have a lot of years together.
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"They'll be
happy ones."
COCHRANE,Metamorphosis,"Captain, don't tell them about me."
UHURA,Metamorphosis,Mister Scott.
UHURA,Metamorphosis,"Computer central reports that
we're coming up on the co-ordinates of the last established position of
the shuttlecraft."
UHURA,Metamorphosis,"If the shuttlecraft powered away, Mister Scott, but if it were
just towed?"
UHURA,Metamorphosis,"What do you think it means, Mister Scott?"
UHURA,Metamorphosis,"Well, I'd feel a lot better if it were a little more definite."
UHURA,Metamorphosis,"If there are no further traces, how are we going to follow them?"
UHURA,Metamorphosis,"It's a big galaxy, Mister Scott."
UHURA,Metamorphosis,"Mister Scott, there are thousands of them out there they could
be on, if they're on any of them at all."
UHURA,Metamorphosis,"Mister Scott, it's the Captain."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"All scanners, spherical sweep."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"Range, maximum."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"They'll have to
pick it up."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"There'd still be traces of residual matter floating around,
Lieutenant."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Lay on that course.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Maintain scanning.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"Steady as she goes, Mister Sulu."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"The shuttlecraft was on schedule until it was shy five hours of
rendezvous."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Then something happened.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,It didn't wreck.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,There was no debris.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"There's no trace of
expelled internal atmosphere, no residual radioactivity."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"Ah, it's."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Something took over.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Tractor beams maybe.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Something.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"They dragged it
away on the heading we're now on."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"We stay on this course, see what comes up."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Aye.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Atmosphere count?
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"All right, then."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,We'll do it the hard way.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"All sensors set for
life form registration."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Automatic selection.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"That's right, Lieutenant."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Thousands.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"And we'll look them over
one by one."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Put him on.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Lock on to his co-ordinates.
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"Captain, this is
Scotty."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Are you all right?
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"The helm is computing your position now,
Captain."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"We'll be there in 57 minutes, sir."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"What happened, Captain?"
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"We're locked in, Captain."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,"Standard orbit
established."
SCOTT,Metamorphosis,Shuttlecraft bay standing by to receive you.
SULU,Metamorphosis,Steady.
SULU,Metamorphosis,"No, Mister Scott, bearing three ten mark thirty five just
cleared."
SULU,Metamorphosis,No antimatter residue.
SULU,Metamorphosis,Bearing two ten mark forty.
SULU,Metamorphosis,Strong particle concentration.
SULU,Metamorphosis,"We're
on it, Mister Scott."
SULU,Metamorphosis,"Course laid in, sir."
SULU,Metamorphosis,Particle density decreasing.
SULU,Metamorphosis,"Gone, sir."
SULU,Metamorphosis,"No
readings."
SULU,Metamorphosis,"Approaching what seems to be an asteroid
belt, sir."
SULU,Metamorphosis,"Scanners report approximately seven thousand bodies of
sizes running from types A to N."
SULU,Metamorphosis,"Approximately thirty four percent of the bodies of atmospherian
types H to M."
SULU,Metamorphosis,Course two twenty four mark twelve.
SULU,Metamorphosis,ETA fifty seven minutes.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,How can we communicate?
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,"My thoughts, you are hearing them."
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,This is interesting.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,"A man needs the company of his own kind, or he will cease to
exist."
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,He felt it to me.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,The man needs others of his species.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,"That is why you are
here."
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,The man must continue.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,Your bodies have stopped their peculiar degeneration.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,"There
will be nothing to harm you."
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,"You will continue, and the man will
continue."
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,This is necessary.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,I do not understand.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,He is part of me.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,The man must continue.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,He does not age.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,He remains forever.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,I do not understand.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,You are wrong.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,The man is the centre of all things.
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,"I care
for him."
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,If I were human there can be love?
COMPANION,Metamorphosis,(vanishes)
MCCOY,Friday's Child,They're quite large.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Seven feet tall is not unusual.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,They're extremely fast and strong.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Lieutenant?
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"In addition, an assortment of swords and knives."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Only a few months.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,We found them totally uninterested in medical aid or hospitals.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,They believe only the strong should survive.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Agreed.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Once they've got it into their heads we're showing force, you can forget them signing any mining treaty."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,We come with open hearts and hands.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Don't move a muscle.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Jim!
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Does Maab know that the Klingons are our sworn enemies by their own words?
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Yes, I mentioned that."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Because he was drawing a weapon on another of their guests.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Look, Jim."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,I know what it means to you to lose a crewman.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Yes, Captain?"
MCCOY,Friday's Child,I understand.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,You've shown friendship by handing over our weapons.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,She's making a gesture in return.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Jim!
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"You touch it, her nearest male relative will have to try to kill you."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,They're offering you a chance for combat.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,They consider it more pleasurable than love.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Let me take this, Jim."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,What Maab has said is true.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Our customs are different.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"What the Klingon has said is unimportant, and we do not hear his words."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,I just called the Klingon a liar.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Captain, careful."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Captain, I'm going to fix that woman's arm."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,They can only kill me once for touching her.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Let me see that arm.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Now listen, you may be a Capellan woman and the widow of a high teer, but I'm a doctor, and it's my tradition to care for the sick and injured."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Now, let me see that arm."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"You listen to me, young woman."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,I'll touch you in any way or manner that my professional judgment indicates.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Just as I thought.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,It can come anytime now.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Because I'm a doctor, that's how I know."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Capellans aren't human, Jim."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,They're humanoid.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,There's certain internal differences.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,I don't have equipment to handle an emergency.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Forget it.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,I can do it.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,The last thing I want around is a ham-handed ship's captain.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,I'll need help getting her in there.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Look, I'm a doctor, not an escalator!"
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Spock, give me a hand!"
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Just a minute.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Let me get her on the rock.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,There you go.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,No a right cross.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,It's in mine from now on.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Easy, easy."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,I'm here.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Now you must want the child!
MCCOY,Friday's Child,So they take all the credit here.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Poppycock!
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Answer me.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Do you want my help?
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Answer me.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Do you want my help?
MCCOY,Friday's Child,(she nods) All right.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Say to yourself, The child is mine."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,The child is mine.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,It is mine!
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"No, no."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,You've got it all wrong.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,No.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Say to yourself, The child is mine."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,It is mine.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,It is
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"No, no, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"You place this arm under here to support its back, and this hand here to support its head."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,I'll explain later.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Jim!
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Spock!
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Jim!
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Spock!
MCCOY,Friday's Child,My patient spattered me with a rock.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,She's gone.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,It's all right.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,It's in there.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"I guess I'll forget psychiatry, stick with surgery."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,I really thought she'd learned to want it.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,I'll go with you.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"No, that's not the way to handle it."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Here, like this."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Here, take his little head like that."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"There, arm in a."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,That's it.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,See how easy?
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Oochy-woochy coochy-coo.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,Oochy-woochy coochy-coo.
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Representing the high teer, Leonard James Akaar."
MCCOY,Friday's Child,"Has a kind of a ring to it, don't you think, James?"
UHURA,Friday's Child,"Call from the bridge, Captain."
UHURA,Friday's Child,"Mister Scott, I'm getting a call from a vessel."
UHURA,Friday's Child,It's so faint I can't make it out.
UHURA,Friday's Child,I've lost it.
UHURA,Friday's Child,It sounded like a distress signal from an Earth vessel.
UHURA,Friday's Child,"I have the signal clear now, Mister Scott."
UHURA,Friday's Child,It is a distress call.
UHURA,Friday's Child,It's from the SS Dierdre.
UHURA,Friday's Child,Reporting they're under attack.
UHURA,Friday's Child,"They're running, trying to manoeuvre."
UHURA,Friday's Child,It's a Klingon vessel attacking.
UHURA,Friday's Child,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
UHURA,Friday's Child,"Come in, Captain."
UHURA,Friday's Child,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
UHURA,Friday's Child,"Come in, Captain."
UHURA,Friday's Child,Enterprise to Mister Spock.
UHURA,Friday's Child,"Doctor McCoy, come in please."
UHURA,Friday's Child,"Scotty, the captain."
UHURA,Friday's Child,"Negative, sir."
UHURA,Friday's Child,"There's nothing, Mister Scott."
UHURA,Friday's Child,All channels and frequencies are clear.
UHURA,Friday's Child,Or it could be an authentic distress call.
UHURA,Friday's Child,"Mister Scott, another distress call from the USS Carolina."
UHURA,Friday's Child,The Carolina is registered in this sector.
UHURA,Friday's Child,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,Friday's Child,This is the USS Enterprise calling unidentified Klingon vessel.
UHURA,Friday's Child,Come in.
UHURA,Friday's Child,USS Enterprise calling Klingon vessel.
UHURA,Friday's Child,"Acknowledge, please."
UHURA,Friday's Child,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,"Bridge, Helm, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,"Now in standard orbit, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,I've pinpointed their encampment below.
SULU,Friday's Child,"Aye, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,You think it's a Klingon ship?
SULU,Friday's Child,"Picking it up, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,Taking a fix.
SULU,Friday's Child,"Interception course computed and laid in, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,"Aye, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,"Approaching the freighter's last reported position, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,"At best, a freighter might travel warp two."
SULU,Friday's Child,"It couldn't have run away from us, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,Not a freighter.
SULU,Friday's Child,Wouldn't they normally call for the nearest starship?
SULU,Friday's Child,A trap.
SULU,Friday's Child,We were diverted from the planet.
SULU,Friday's Child,"Yes, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,Continuing.
SULU,Friday's Child,"Still negative, Mister Scott."
SULU,Friday's Child,All sweeps.
SULU,Friday's Child,"Warp five, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,On course for Capella Four.
SULU,Friday's Child,"Scotty, if it should turn out to be real"
SULU,Friday's Child,"Thirty one minutes, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,"Reversing to sub-light, one half."
SULU,Friday's Child,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,"I have it on the viewscreen now, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,Still distant.
SULU,Friday's Child,"Holding a position dead ahead, sir."
SULU,Friday's Child,Still closing.
SULU,Friday's Child,The alien's directly in our line of flight.
SULU,Friday's Child,"Phaser banks are ready, sir."
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Yes, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Report.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Very good.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Have the transporter room stand by.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Analysis, gentlemen."
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Yes, but in this case, with the more people we take down, the greater chance we have of violating one of their taboos."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Very well.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Scotty, you're in command."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Bear in mind that the Klingons have been sighted in this sector.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"While we're negotiating down there, we don't want the Enterprise to become an incident up here."
KIRK,Friday's Child,I'm Captain Kirk.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Grant, no!"
KIRK,Friday's Child,"He was young, and inexperienced."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Let me call my ship and inform them
KIRK,Friday's Child,So they keep their word scrupulously.
KIRK,Friday's Child,They're unusually honest.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Is that what I heard you say, Doctor?"
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Dangerous if lied to, if their customs are violated."
KIRK,Friday's Child,"We lied to no one, Doctor."
KIRK,Friday's Child,We violated no customs.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Perhaps you'll explain to me why one of my men is dead.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Grant looked up, saw a Klingon, made a purely instinctive defensive move."
KIRK,Friday's Child,What's a Klingon doing down here among your scrupulously honest friends anyway?
KIRK,Friday's Child,"That's only one down, Doctor."
KIRK,Friday's Child,There's over four hundred more up there in orbit.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"And if there's a Klingon down here, there might be a Klingon ship up there somewhere."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Bones.
KIRK,Friday's Child,I shouldn't have chewed you out.
KIRK,Friday's Child,I'm sorry.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Yes, you're quite right, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Inefficient and illogical.
KIRK,Friday's Child,I'm Captain Kirk.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"First of all, I must protest the killing of my crewman."
KIRK,Friday's Child,"The Earth Federation offers one other thing, Akaar."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Our laws.
KIRK,Friday's Child,And the highest of all our laws states that your world is yours and will always remain yours.
KIRK,Friday's Child,This differs us from the Klingons.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Their empire is made up of conquered worlds.
KIRK,Friday's Child,They take what they want by arms and force.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"We need our communicators, those devices on our belts."
KIRK,Friday's Child,If there's a Klingon ship somewhere
KIRK,Friday's Child,Klingon!
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Communicators, weapons."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Type of vessel.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Location.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Wait.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"If you lead these people now, be certain you make the right decisions."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Or let the Klingon and me fight.
KIRK,Friday's Child,It might amuse you.
KIRK,Friday's Child,No!
KIRK,Friday's Child,I must assume that something's keeping them busy up there.
KIRK,Friday's Child,The Klingon ship.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"That's a very good idea, Bones."
KIRK,Friday's Child,(knife at her throat) You said you're prepared to die.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Does that mean you'd prefer to die?
KIRK,Friday's Child,I think we can get you safely to the ship.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Your choice.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Bones.
KIRK,Friday's Child,All right.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Let's go.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Stay with her, Bones."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Nice place to get trapped in.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Yes, I see."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Scout up the trail that way.
KIRK,Friday's Child,See what we have in the way of an exit.
KIRK,Friday's Child,I'll take a look around.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Good.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"If we could block off that entrance, hold them off, it'd give us more time."
KIRK,Friday's Child,They'd have to go around these hills.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Do you think we could create a sonic disruption with two of our communicators?
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Well, if you don't think we can, maybe we shouldn't try."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Worried about the delivery?
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Well, if you don't think you can handle it"
KIRK,Friday's Child,There's a cave in there.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Probably the only shelter around here.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Bones, you've got one of those magnesite-nitron tablets in your kit."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Give me one.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"How did you arrange to touch her, Bones, give her a happy pill?"
KIRK,Friday's Child,Never seen that in a medical book.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Vegetation, Captain."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Evidently there's water nearby.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Good, but we need weapons just as much as we need water, Spock."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Follow me.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Come in.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Come in.
KIRK,Friday's Child,You mean it makes a good bowstring.
KIRK,Friday's Child,That's more like it.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Since the Capellans never developed the bow, this may come as big a surprise as gunpowder was on Earth."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Our child?
KIRK,Friday's Child,"What happened, Bones?"
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Bones, you took a medical oath long before you signed aboard my ship."
KIRK,Friday's Child,That small patient in there needs you.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Spock.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Spock!
KIRK,Friday's Child,The cavalry doesn't come over the hill in the nick of time anymore.
KIRK,Friday's Child,There's just one thing I want.
KIRK,Friday's Child,One of us must get him.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Why not?
KIRK,Friday's Child,Klingon!
KIRK,Friday's Child,"We missed you, Mister Scott."
KIRK,Friday's Child,"An obscure Earth dialect, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Oochy-woochy coochy-coo.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"If you're curious, consult linguistics."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Interesting?
KIRK,Friday's Child,"We don't actually understand it ourselves, Mister Scott."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Contact Starfleet.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Inform them the Federation mining rights on Capella have been secured by treaty, documents signed by the young high chief's regent."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Report follows.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Yes, Eleen."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Remarkable young lady.
KIRK,Friday's Child,Yes.
KIRK,Friday's Child,"I think it's a name destined to go down in galactic history, Leonard."
KIRK,Friday's Child,"What do you think, Spock?"
KIRK,Friday's Child,"Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Friday's Child,Ahead warp factor one.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"How long were you stationed on the planet, Doctor?"
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,We'll keep on our toes.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Well, let's put it on the screen."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Who else would be playing cat and mouse with a starship?
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Well, they can't hurt us much out there, bobbing about like that."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,No need to call the captain yet.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Put a booster on it, Lieutenant."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Try to pull it in.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Dierdre?
SCOTT,Friday's Child,That's a freighter.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Helm?
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Try the captain.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Prepare to take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,We have a distress call from a Federation ship under attack.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,That's where our duty lies.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Ahead warp five.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,We were forced to leave Capella to aid a Federation vessel under attack by a Klingon vessel.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,We were unable to contact our landing party before we were forced to answer the distress signal.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Our inability to reach the landing party is strange and I am concerned.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Sensor report, Mister Chekov."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Mister Sulu, begin a standard search pattern."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"All scanners full intensity, Mister Chekov."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,(to Uhura) No signal at all?
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"I'm well aware of a freighter's maximum speed, Mister Sulu."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,A vessel doesn't just disappear.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Mister Chekov?
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Mister Chekov, pull the microtape on that distress call."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,I want it replayed.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Did you hear it?
SCOTT,Friday's Child,They called us by name.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Not a general distress signal, but one aimed right at us."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,How would a freighter know we were ordered into this sector?
SCOTT,Friday's Child,We'll stay long enough to make certain.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Continue search pattern.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Mister Chekov?
SCOTT,Friday's Child,We're turning back.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Warp five, Helm."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Warp 6 as soon as she'll take it, Mister Sulu."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,The captain could be in trouble back there.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Ignore it.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Ignore it, Lieutenant."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Log it as my order, my responsibility."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"There's an old, old saying on Earth, Mister Sulu."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Fool me once, shame on you."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Fool me twice, shame on me."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Estimating to planet?
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Sub-light one half.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Mister Sulu, sound battle stations."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Drawing a line, daring us to step over it."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,This is the commander of the USS Enterprise.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Identify yourself and your intention.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Acknowledge.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Close out the frequency, Lieutenant."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"And we'll go right down their throat, if necessary."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Let's see if they have the belly for it.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Hold it there.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,Drop your weapons.
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"Well sir, we had a wee bit of a run-in with a Klingon vessel, but he had no stomach for fighting."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"We checked the encampment, found out you were here, and had no trouble at all in tracking you down."
SCOTT,Friday's Child,I could
SCOTT,Friday's Child,"What's that again, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Ordinarily, under these circumstances, I would recommend a large, well-armed landing party."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,He also mentioned that they can be highly dangerous.
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Inefficient, however."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Emotion, Captain."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"It would appear, Captain, that he finds you a disappointment."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Our check-in signal is one hour, twelve minutes overdue."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Since no reconnaissance party has appeared, and since Mister Scott is notably efficient in such matters"
SPOCK,Friday's Child,That would seem a logical conclusion.
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Yes, Captain, an excellent idea."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"But a defensible entrance, Captain."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"The walls get higher and narrower, but there is a way out."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,There is enough loose rock and shale.
SPOCK,Friday's Child,Only a very slight chance it would work.
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Captain, I didn't say that exactly."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,The sound beams should produce a sympathetic vibration on the weak area of that slide.
SPOCK,Friday's Child,There would seem to be little weapon potential at hand.
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Fortunately, this bark has suitable tensile cohesion."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,I believe I said that.
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"I would rather, I would rather not."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,Thank you.
SPOCK,Friday's Child,That should prove very interesting.
SPOCK,Friday's Child,The child?
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Virtue is a relative term, Doctor."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,She'll head straight to the warriors.
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Here, Captain."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Over here, Captain."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,(into communicator as Kirk joins him.)
SPOCK,Friday's Child,Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"If by that you mean we can't expect help from the Enterprise, I must agree."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,The Klingon?
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Revenge, Captain?"
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Oochy-woochy coochy-coo, Captain?"
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"Well, at any rate, this should prove interesting."
SPOCK,Friday's Child,When the woman starts explaining how the new high teer is actually Doctor McCoy's child.
SPOCK,Friday's Child,Nor does Doctor McCoy.
SPOCK,Friday's Child,The child's regent?
SPOCK,Friday's Child,The child was named Leonard James Akaar?
SPOCK,Friday's Child,"I think you're both going to be insufferably pleased with yourselves for at least a month, sir."
MAAB,Friday's Child,Halt!
MAAB,Friday's Child,You are of the Earth vessel?
MAAB,Friday's Child,"We understand only that he also offers things of value for our rocks, and he has freely handed us his weapons and other devices."
MAAB,Friday's Child,Will you do the same?
MAAB,Friday's Child,Will you hand us your weapons?
MAAB,Friday's Child,"Their customs are different, Teer."
MAAB,Friday's Child,"Laughter, Teer?"
MAAB,Friday's Child,Is not the Klingon an honoured guest also?
MAAB,Friday's Child,Is it not best to have two who bargain for the same goods?
MAAB,Friday's Child,"I speak for many, Teer."
MAAB,Friday's Child,Hear the words of the Klingon.
MAAB,Friday's Child,"Good, good."
MAAB,Friday's Child,Let the Klingons and the Earthmen offer us amusement.
MAAB,Friday's Child,Capellans welcome this.
MAAB,Friday's Child,"There are those of us who won't bargain with Earthmen, Akaar."
MAAB,Friday's Child,"Let that be your choice, Teer."
MAAB,Friday's Child,Release him.
MAAB,Friday's Child,(Kirk does so.)
MAAB,Friday's Child,Akaar is dead.
MAAB,Friday's Child,I am the teer.
MAAB,Friday's Child,Perhaps to be a teer is to see in new ways.
MAAB,Friday's Child,"I begin to like you, Earthman, and I saw fear in the Klingon's eye."
MAAB,Friday's Child,"That too may change, Klingon."
MAAB,Friday's Child,You carry a child who would be teer.
MAAB,Friday's Child,No man may touch the wife of a teer.
MAAB,Friday's Child,Klingon.
MAAB,Friday's Child,There's nothing to concern you there.
MAAB,Friday's Child,"(taking a disrupter from under his cloak) We have them well cared for, Klingon."
MAAB,Friday's Child,Your weapon will be returned when our business is completed.
MAAB,Friday's Child,That was our agreement.
MAAB,Friday's Child,The Earthmen make excellent game.
MAAB,Friday's Child,Their cleverness has surprised me.
MAAB,Friday's Child,"We will honour our law, and our word to you, Klingon."
MAAB,Friday's Child,It is in order.
MAAB,Friday's Child,She is the wife of a teer.
MAAB,Friday's Child,(Kras runs off.)
MAAB,Friday's Child,No!
MAAB,Friday's Child,"Is this what your sworn word means, Klingon?"
MAAB,Friday's Child,Naam.
MAAB,Friday's Child,"(drawing his knife) As teer of the Ten Tribes, I give you back your life."
MAAB,Friday's Child,Mine is now forfeit.
MAAB,Friday's Child,"Keel, stand ready."
MAAB,Friday's Child,Klingon!
GRANT,Friday's Child,A Klingon!
KRAS,Friday's Child,"I am unaware of any state of war between our peoples, Captain."
KRAS,Friday's Child,Or is it your policy to kill Klingons on sight?
KRAS,Friday's Child,To bring down an attack upon their village?
KRAS,Friday's Child,"It is as I told you, Maab."
KRAS,Friday's Child,Earthmen fear to bargain honestly.
KRAS,Friday's Child,"And different from those of my people, too, Teer."
KRAS,Friday's Child,The sight of death frightens them.
KRAS,Friday's Child,What do Earth men offer you?
KRAS,Friday's Child,What have you obtained from them in the past?
KRAS,Friday's Child,Powders and liquids for the sick?
KRAS,Friday's Child,We Klingons believe as you do.
KRAS,Friday's Child,The sick should die.
KRAS,Friday's Child,Only the strong should live.
KRAS,Friday's Child,Earthmen have promised to teach the youth of your tribes many things.
KRAS,Friday's Child,What?
KRAS,Friday's Child,What things?
KRAS,Friday's Child,Cleverness against enemies?
KRAS,Friday's Child,The use of weapons?
KRAS,Friday's Child,"I have no quarrel with you, Captain."
KRAS,Friday's Child,I wish merely to return to my vessel.
KRAS,Friday's Child,"A small scout ship, Captain."
KRAS,Friday's Child,"We need the mineral, too."
KRAS,Friday's Child,I was sent to negotiate.
KRAS,Friday's Child,Kill them now.
KRAS,Friday's Child,Is the new leader of the Ten Tribes afraid?
KRAS,Friday's Child,Let me kill him for you.
KRAS,Friday's Child,We had an agreement.
KRAS,Friday's Child,"She was prepared to die, Earthman."
KRAS,Friday's Child,"We made an agreement, Maab."
KRAS,Friday's Child,I have a right to my weapons.
KRAS,Friday's Child,(slightly out of breath) They must die.
KRAS,Friday's Child,That is your law.
KRAS,Friday's Child,"If true, take us to them."
KRAS,Friday's Child,"First, we'll verify her story."
KRAS,Friday's Child,The next man who raises a weapon destroys all of you.
KRAS,Friday's Child,"You and your primitive knives and your weapons, I'll teach you what killing really means."
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,Mister Scott.
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,"I'm picking up something on the sensors, sir."
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,Seems to be another ship.
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,"It's just at the edge of our sensor range, sir."
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,Hard to get an exact reading.
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,"The ship's disappeared, sir."
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,Gone out of range.
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,"I have it on the sensors, sir."
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,"Tie into my channel, Lieutenant."
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,"Negative, sir."
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,"No debris, no residual particles, no traces."
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,It should be on our screens by now.
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,"Nothing, sir."
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,"If it were destroyed, I'd pick up debris readings of some sort."
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,Nothing.
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,I know this saying.
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,It was invented in Russia.
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,(he smirks to himself)
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,Mister Scott?
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,"Sensors picking up a vessel ahead, cutting across our path."
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,"It's an alien, sir."
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,By configuration a Klingon warship.
CHEKOV,Friday's Child,Taking position directly in our path.
MAN,Friday's Child,Chur-ah.
AKAAR,Friday's Child,I am the teer Akaar.
AKAAR,Friday's Child,I lead the Ten Tribes of Capella.
AKAAR,Friday's Child,"And this is Eleen, a young wife to give an old man a son to rule these tribes."
AKAAR,Friday's Child,"If it was your man, wasn't it his privilege to die for you?"
AKAAR,Friday's Child,I do not understand.
AKAAR,Friday's Child,It was the Earth people who first bargained for our rocks.
AKAAR,Friday's Child,"It is I who speak for the tribe, Maab."
AKAAR,Friday's Child,"The Earth men have different customs, but never have they lied to our people."
AKAAR,Friday's Child,"Do you say you will fight me, Maab?"
AKAAR,Friday's Child,The sky does not interest me.
AKAAR,Friday's Child,I must consider the words I have heard.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,"The Klingon speaks the truth, Akaar."
ELEEN,Friday's Child,Leave him.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,I must die.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,I was proud to obey the laws.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,Kill him first.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,He laid hands upon me.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,It is my right to see him die.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,You will not touch me.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,To live is always desirable.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,You will not touch me in that manner.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,How do you know?
ELEEN,Friday's Child,Even the women of our village cannot tell so much with a touch.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,Strange hand.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,Very soft.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,No!
ELEEN,Friday's Child,Only McCoy.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,No!
ELEEN,Friday's Child,No!
ELEEN,Friday's Child,I will allow only your touch.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,"No, no."
ELEEN,Friday's Child,Pain is here.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,"No, no."
ELEEN,Friday's Child,It's there.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,The The pain is there.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,No!
ELEEN,Friday's Child,McCoy!
ELEEN,Friday's Child,No.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,"Here, child belongs to husband."
ELEEN,Friday's Child,"Yes, it's yours."
ELEEN,Friday's Child,"Yes, McCoy."
ELEEN,Friday's Child,It's yours.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,McCoy.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,Bring our child.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,"The child is dead, Maab."
ELEEN,Friday's Child,Do as you will with me.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,Dead.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,I killed them as they slept.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,"Do you doubt my word, Klingon?"
ELEEN,Friday's Child,I'm the wife of a teer.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,I will die in my own tent.
ELEEN,Friday's Child,Fight!
ELEEN,Friday's Child,Are you warriors or children?
ELEEN,Friday's Child,"Maab, I will flee."
ELEEN,Friday's Child,"When the Klingon turns to fire, I'll"

CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Here's the report on Pollux Five,
Captain."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",This entire system has been almost the same.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","A strange lack of
intelligent life on the planets."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",It bugs the percentages.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Aye, sir."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Well, I was up all night working on this report, sir."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","All right, Scotty."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Just let me give this to Mister Spock.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","What am I doing down here, Doctor?"
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Correct.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Apollo, twin brother of Artemis, son of the god Zeus and Leto,
a mortal."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",He was the god of light and purity.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","He was skilled in the bow
and lyre."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Obviously he has some knowledge of Earth.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","His classical
references and the appearance of all this."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Captain.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",But why?
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",What you've said so far makes no sense at all.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Lieutenant Palamas.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Carolyn.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Oh, it's beautiful."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","It's all right, Captain."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I'll go.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Oh, it's lovely."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Frightened?
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","No, I don't think so."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Of course, a girl doesn't go
walking with a"
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","All right, a god every day."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",What happened to the others?
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Artemis, Hera?"
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You mean they died?
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You really think you're a god?
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",But you said the others didn't die.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I don't understand.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Captain.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","No, don't!"
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",A father doesn't destroy his children.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You said you were
gentle and understanding."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",How can they worship you if you hurt them?
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Apollo, please."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",(taking his hand) You know so much of love.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Please don't hurt them.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Please.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Oh, yes, I'm all right."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I have a message for you.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",He wants us to live in peace.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",He wants to provide for us.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","He'll give us everything we ever wanted, and he can do it, too."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I don't understand.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Yes?
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",What?
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Yes.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I love him.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","No, not on me."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Oh, but you don't understand."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","He's kind, and he wants the best
for us."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",And he's so lonely.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",What you ask would break his heart.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","How can
I?"
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Yes.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Yes, I understand."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",He's calling me.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Yes, sir."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",My orders and my duty.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I must say, Apollo, the way you ape human behaviour is
remarkable, but there are some other things I must know."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Your
evolutionary patterns and your social development."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I'm sure they're unique.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I've never encountered a specimen
like you before."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I'm sure that's very flattering, but I must get on with my
work now."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I'm a scientist.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","My particular specialty is ancient
civilisations, relics, and myths."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Surely you know I've only been
studying you."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Love you?
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Be logical.
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I'm not some simple shepherdess you can
awe."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Why, I could no more love you than I could love a new species of
bacteria."
CAROLYN,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Is that the secret of your power over women, the thunderbolts
you throw?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Bugs the?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Well, carry out the standard procedures on Pollux Four."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Bones, could you get that excited over a cup of coffee?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Why, Bones?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Scotty's a good man.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I like to think of it not so much losing an officer as gaining
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Actually, I'm losing an officer."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Cartographic Detail, stand by."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Preliminary reports, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Cartographic Sections, implement standard orders."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Analysis, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","What is it, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Is it a hand?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","A trick, then?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",A projection?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Hard about.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Reverse all engines.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Lieutenant, relay our position and
circumstances to Starbase Twelve immediately."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Mister Sulu try rocking the ship.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Full impulse power forward and
back."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Thank you.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Mister Sulu?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Status.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Thank you.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Mister Sulu.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Our forward tractor beams, adjust to
repel."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Activate.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Let's all take a look at it, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Response frequencies, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","This is Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the USS Enterprise."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Please identify yourself.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Are you responsible for stopping the ship?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Give it back, then we'll talk."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I don't know who or what you are, but I must warn you we have the
power to defend ourselves."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","If you value your safety, release this ship."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Never mind the history lesson.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Release the ship!
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Compensate.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",All right!
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Whatever you're doing, turn it off!"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You win!
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Let's go, Bones."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You in good voice?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","If we don't accept his invitation, we'll have a crushed eggshell
where this ship used to be."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Insulted, Spock?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Good.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We'll tackle him together.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We already know the questions.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You're the best man to find the answers.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Tricorders.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Come on.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You know of Earth?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You've been there?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You mentioned Agamemnon, Hector, Odysseus."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","How do you know about
them?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Mister Chekov.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",And you haven't yet.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Readings, Doctor."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Evidently not so simple.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",All right.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We're here at your invitation.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Would you mind telling
us what you want without all the Olympian generalities?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Transporter room.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",What is it you want?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","If you want to play god and call yourself Apollo, that's your
business, but you're no god to us, Mister."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",And you've got a lot to learn!
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Analysis.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Lieutenant Palamas, what do you know about Apollo?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",And this thing?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",(the temple)
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I think the appearance of this is for our benefit.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Bones?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Fine, but what power, and where is it?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Scout around with your
tricorders."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Find the source of that power.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Bones.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Bones, I wonder if five thousand years ago"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I have an idea.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",What if he is really Apollo?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Apollo, we're willing to talk, but you'll find we don't bow to
every creature who happens to have a bag of tricks."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I have four hundred and thirty people on that ship up there.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Scotty.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",(picks up the twisted and melted weapon) Very impressive.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",How'd you do it?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Bones, how is he?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",He would have been rather difficult to stop.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Mister Chekov, I think you'd better continue your investigation."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","How do you feel, Scotty?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",It would seem so.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Mister Scott, I understand your concern over her, but she
volunteered to go with him, hopefully to find out more about him."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","She's
doing her job."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I think it's about time you started doing yours.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We've
got to find out the source of his power."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You've got a tricorder.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Use it
if you're able to."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",And one more thing.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I want no more unauthorised action against
Apollo or whatever he is."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",That's an order!
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Besides, you stiff-necked thistle head, you could have gotten
yourself killed."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Apollo's no god.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","But he could have been taken for one, though,
once."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Say five thousand years ago, a highly sophisticated group of
space travellers landed on Earth around the Mediterranean."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Especially if they had the power to alter their form at will and
command great energy."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","In fact, they couldn't have been taken for
anything else."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I've just picked up readings for our own people, sir."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Apollo has no difficulty focusing.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","He taps that energy, Mister
Scott."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Are you suggesting that he, Apollo, taps a flow of energy and
channels it through his body?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Mister Chekov, I think you've earned your pay for the week."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","But
where is the source of that power?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Is that all you have to offer?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Bones, is it possible"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Where's Lieutenant Palamas?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Scotty!
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","All right, mister."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You wanted worshippers?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You've got enemies.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You want us to bow down, you'll have to"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Take care of Scotty.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Where's Apollo?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Don't you mean the English story, the Cheshire Cat?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","All right, all right, all right."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Very good, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",That might very well mean something.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We've got to get out of here.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Well, let's assume that five thousand years ago creatures like
our friend Apollo did indeed visit Earth and form the basis of the
Greek classic myths."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Most mythology has its basis in fact.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","If I remember my ancient
legends, the gods, after expending energy, required rest, even as we
humans."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Something like that.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Remember, he's keeping a force field on the
ship and he's expending energy down here."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You said he looked pained and
tired when he disappeared."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","If we can wear him out, overwork him, that
might do it."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","If we can provoke him so that he strikes one of us again, there's
a chance that he'll be drained enough so the rest of us can jump him."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Not all of us, Bones."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","When he comes back, it's a chance we'll
have to take."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You know nothing about our kind.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You know only our remote
ancestors who trembled before your tricks."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Your tricks don't frighten
us, neither do you."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We've come a long way in five thousand years.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Mankind has no need for gods.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We find the one quite adequate.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We're busy.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",(quietly) Look after the girl.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Go!
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Gather laurel leaves?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You must be joking!
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Lieutenant, get back."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We're tired of your phony fireworks!
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Lieutenant!
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Lieutenant!
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Lieutenant.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","And you will supply the herds of sheep, and the pipes we'll play,
and the simple skins we'll wear for clothes."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We were doing something until our brave lady stepped in and saved
us."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Yes, I have."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",One more.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","And it depends on the lieutenant's
loyalty."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","If she fails us, we'd better get used to herding goats."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Kirk to Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Enterprise, come
in."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Kirk to Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Kirk to
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Scotty, I'll find out."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",How old are you?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Then I'd better handle it.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","(goes over to a very satisfied looking
woman) You all right?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Come over there.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Well?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","All right, Lieutenant, you can come down from Mount Olympus now."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You've got work to do.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","He thrives on love, worship, attention."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We can't give him that worship, none of us can."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Especially you.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Spurn him.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Reject him.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You must.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You're special to him.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Lieutenant.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","All our lives, here and on the ship, depend on you."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","On you, Lieutenant!"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Reject him, and we have a chance to save
ourselves."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Accept him, and you condemn all of us to slavery, nothing
less than slavery."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We might never get help this far out.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Or perhaps the
thought of spending an eternity bending knee and tending sheep appeals
to you."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Give me your hand.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Your hand.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",(she does) Now feel that.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Human
flesh against human flesh."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We're the same.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We share the same history,
the same heritage, the same lives."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We're tied together beyond any
untying."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Man or woman, it makes no difference."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We're human.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We couldn't
escape from each other even if we wanted to."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","That's how you do it,
Lieutenant."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",By remembering who and what you are.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","A bit of flesh and
blood afloat in a universe without end."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","The only thing that's truly
yours is the rest of humanity."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",That's where our duty lies.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Do you
understand me?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Lieutenant.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You have your orders and your duty.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","There is indeed, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Very good.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",How are you doing on the force field?
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Well, that ought to do it."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Have Sulu lock all
phaser banks onto the structure."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Fire on my order only.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Cut it fine.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We'll be standing nearby.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I'd love to oblige you, Mister Spock, but we're not all
together."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Besides, we have Apollo to deal with."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","If that structure is the source of his power,
I want to know where he is when we attack it."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Kirk out.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Bones, do you think that mysterious organ in
Apollo's chest could have something to do with the transmission of
energy?"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Yes, I know."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I know.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Scotty.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We'll wait.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",(answers communicator) Kirk here.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Stand by your phasers, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Prepare
to fire on my signal."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Kirk out.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We've got to be here when he comes back.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Scotty, just hold on!"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",All right.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",The temple is his power source.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Let's bring him back
to it."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Get to cover.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Mister Spock, fire those phasers."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Fire those phasers!
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","That's an order, Mister Spock!"
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Scotty!
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We've out grown you.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You asked for something we could no longer
give."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",So do I.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",They gave us so much.
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","The Greek civilisation, much of
our culture and philosophy came from a worship of those beings."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","In a
way, they began the Golden Age."
KIRK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Would it have hurt us, I wonder, just
to have gathered a few laurel leaves?"
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Lieutenant, you look a bit tired this morning."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Even from here I can tell his pulse rate's up.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I'm not sure I like that, Jim."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","And he thinks he's the right man for her, but I'm not sure she
thinks he's the right man."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","On the other hand, she's a woman."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",All woman.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","One day she'll find the right man and off she'll go, out of the
service."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",What in the name of?
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Sickbay reports five minor injuries, all being treated."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Sure it's wise, Jim?"
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Well, you're the A and A officer, aren't you?"
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Archaeology,
anthropology, ancient civilisations."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We're going to need help in all those areas.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Simple humanoid, Captain."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","To coin a phrase, fascinating."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I can't say much till I check our these readings.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","He looks
human, but of course that doesn't mean a thing."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Yes?
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You have a theory?
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",What?
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",May I ask what you offer in exchange for this worship?
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Stunned but coming around.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I'm not sure it's wise to let her go
off like that."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You saw how capricious he is.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Benevolent one minute, angry the
next."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",One more wrong move from her and he could kill her.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Scotty doesn't believe in gods.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Yes.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","To the simple shepherds and tribesmen of early Greece,
creatures like that would have been gods."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Not the whole encyclopaedia, Chekov."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Spock's contaminating this boy, Jim."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Number one on our list of things to do.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Yes, except my estimation for his physical condition."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","In spite
of Apollo's bag of tricks, he comes up essentially normal with just a
few variations."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","However, there's an extra organ in his chest that I
can't even make a guess about."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Jim.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Not good.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Severe shock.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Chekov, give me a hand."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",How do you feel?
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Some neural damage.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Makes sense.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",The trouble with overworking him is that it can get us killed.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I still say it can get us killed.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Kill a deer.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",That's the funniest thing I ever heard.
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Any more good ideas, Jim?"
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Well, it doesn't serve any other purpose I know of."
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",What the devil is that?
MCCOY,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I wish we hadn't had to do this.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Well in that case, there's nothing like a wee bit of coffee to
get you back in shape."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Join me, Carolyn?"
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Gentlemen.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Come along, my dear."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Come along.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","External pressure building up, Captain."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Eight hundred GSC and
climbing."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",One thousand GSC and climbing.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","(The crew react to increasing air
pressure) Becoming critical, Captain."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We can't handle it.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Pressure is gone, Captain."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Space normal on hull.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Power is what he controls.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You can't do tricks like that without
energy."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I would like to point out that we are quite capable of some
wrath ourselves."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Leave her alone.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",And so do you.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",She's not going with you.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I am tingling all over.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Did he take her with him?
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Captain, we've got to stop him."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",He wants her.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","The way he looks
at her."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I'm able, sir."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Aye, aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Aye.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Unquestionably, an immensely powerful field of energy is being
generated around here somewhere."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We're just having difficulty focusing
on it."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You bloodthirsty Saracen, what have you done with her?"
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I can't get my arm to move.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Captain, we've got to do something!"
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Carolyn.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",What's happened to her?
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Captain, we've got to wait until Carolyn comes back before we
fire on the temple."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We don't know what would happen to her if he was
suddenly attacked."
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",She might get killed.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Captain, we've got to go and find her!"
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",But what if he doesn't.
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",What if he
SCOTT,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Captain!
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Entering standard orbit around Pollux Four, sir."
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Am I seeing things?
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",And I am the tsar of all the Russias.
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I'm sorry, Captain."
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I never met a god before.
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Whatever he is, he seems to control a remarkable technology."
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Captain, the phasers."
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",All the working parts are fused.
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Aye, aye, sir."
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","There is a repeated occurrence of
registrations, a regular pulsating pattern of radiated energy."
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Sir, some creatures can generate and control energy with no
harm to themselves."
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","The electric eel on Earth, the giant dry worm of
Antos Four, the fluffy"
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",The captain requires complete information.
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","That would seem most likely, sir."
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Are you all right, Captain?"
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",He disappeared again like the cat in that Russian story.
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Cheshire?
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","No, sir."
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Minsk perhaps, but"
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Sir, there is something I noticed."
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Apollo looked very strange
when he disappeared, tired or in pain."
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I don't know if it means
anything."
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",How?
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","And Apollo's gone, after attacking you and Mister Scott."
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You
think maybe he's off somewhere recharging his energy cells?"
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Perhaps if I assisted.
CHEKOV,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Twenty two, sir."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Standing by, sir."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",All cartographic standards full automatic.
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",It's almost as if it means to grab us.
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Damage report coming in, Captain."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Situation under control.
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Minor
damage, stations three, seven, and nineteen."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Activity on hailing channel three, sir."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Calculated.
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Channel open, sir."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Mister Spock, I can't contact the landing party."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","All frequencies
are jammed."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I'm working, sir, but I can't do anything with this."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I might be able to rig up a subspace bypass circuit.
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I'm connecting the bypass circuit now, sir."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","It should take
another half hour."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Mister Spock, I haven't done anything like this in years."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","If it
isn't done just right, I could blow the entire communications system."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","It's very delicate work, sir."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Right away.
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I think we can try it now, sir."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Enterprise
to Captain Kirk."
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
UHURA,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Come in, Captain."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Pollux Four.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Class M type planet, oxygen and nitrogen
atmosphere."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Sensors indicate no life forms.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Approximate age four
billion years."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Judged no reason for contact.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","In all respects, quite
ordinary, Captain."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Momentarily.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Not living tissue.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Not a projection, sir."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",A field of energy.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",The ship is almost completely encircled by the field.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","It
resembles a conventional force field but on unusual wavelengths."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Despite its appearance, that of a human appendage, it is definitely not
living tissue."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",It is energy.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Captain, a most curious development on scanner five seven."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Screen on, Captain."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Verbose, isn't he?"
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Insults are effective only where emotion is present.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Try to break through it, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Very efficient.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Mister Sulu, rig all transmission circuits for
maximum power generation."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Compute for reversal of polarity of the field
around the ship."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Lieutenant Kyle, I want a complete sensor scan of the planet."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Locate all the lifeforms.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I want to know what's going on down
there."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Ready to reverse polarity, Mister Sulu?"
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Activate all units.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Cut power, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Lieutenant, we must restore
communications with the landing party."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Oh?
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Good.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Do so.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Sensor report, Mister Kyle."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",And Apollo?
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Origin?
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I would suggest, Mister Sulu, if you cannot find out where the
power source is, you should find out where it is not."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","A simple process
of elimination."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Progress report.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Speed is essential, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I can think no one better equipped to handle it, Miss Uhura."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Please proceed.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Progress, Mister Sulu?"
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Continue the search.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Mister Kyle.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We're unable to break completely loose from this force field,
but we might be able to punch some holes through it."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",To shoot through.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","It might also relieve Lieutenant Uhura's
communications problem."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Take these equations to the nuclear electronics
lab."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I want them to work on the problem of negating the force field in
selected areas."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","That might be done by generating a strong pinpoint
charge of M-rays on some of these selected wave lengths and tying them
in with the combined output of all our engines."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We've pinpointed a power source on the planet's surface
which seems to have something to do with the force field."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Is there a structure of some sort near you?
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",The power emanates from there.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We can negate sections of it, creating
openings through which we can fire our phaser banks."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Captain.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I would recommend a discreet
distance."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Spock, Captain."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Sensors are picking up an atmospheric
disturbance in your area."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Captain, you're too close."
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",More power to the shields.
SPOCK,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",All banks maintain firing rate.
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Captain?
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Not unless I am, too."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Captain, that thing's a giant hand."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Hard about.
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We can't seem to get away from it.
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",All engines reverse.
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We're dead still, Captain."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Helm doesn't answer.
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We can't move.
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Applying thrust, sir."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","No results, Captain."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We're stuck tight.
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Standing by.
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Ineffective, Captain."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","There doesn't seem to be anything to push
against."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Working, sir."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Computed and standing by to generate, sir."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","No good, Mister Spock."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We didn't even faze it.
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We're still locked
tight."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Mister Spock, here's something."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","There seems to be a radiated
energy pulsation coming from the planet."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I don't know what it is, sir."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I can't seem to pinpoint it.
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","The whole planet, sir?"
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Yes, sir."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",The whole planet.
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Sectors one through twenty five charted and examined.
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","No chance
at all of power originating in those areas."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Aye, sir."
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Fourteen B by twenty six index.
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","All phaser banks, fire!"
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","All phaser banks, maintain firing rate!"
SULU,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Maintaining, sir."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","The eons have passed and what has been written
has come about."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You are most welcome, my beloved children."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Your places
await you."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You have left your plains and valleys and made
this bold venture."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",So it was in the beginning.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You have made me proud.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Now you can rest.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We shall remember together.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We shall drink the
sacramental wine."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",There shall be the music of the pipes.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","The long wait
has ended."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Yes.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I caused the wind to withdraw from your
sails."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",It has been five thousand years.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Have you
learned no patience in that time?"
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You have the same fire.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","How like your fathers
you are."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Agamemnon, Hector, Odysseus."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You will obey me, lest I close my hand thus."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",hat was your first lesson.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Remember it.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Captain
Kirk, I invite you and your officers to join me."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","But do not bring that
one, the one with the pointed ears."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","He is much like Pan, and Pan always
bored me."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",No sad faces.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","This is a time to rejoice, not to fear."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You are
returning home."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Let your hearts prepare to sing.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","My children, long have I waited for this moment."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","The memories
you bring of your lush and beautiful Earth, the green fields and blue
skies, the simple shepherds and their flocks."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Once I stretched out my hand, and Earth trembled."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","And I
breathed upon it, and spring returned."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Search your most distant memories, those of the thousands of
years past, and I am there."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Your fathers knew me, and your father's
fathers."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I am Apollo.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Earth, mother of the most beautiful of women in the universe."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",That at least has not changed.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I am pleased.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Yes, my children."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Zeus, Athena, Aphrodite, Artemis."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",A gallant band of travellers.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We knew
your Earth well, five thousand of your years ago."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You will not leave this place.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Your transportation device no longer functions.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I will not permit that device to work, either, Captain."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You will worship me, as your fathers did before you."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I said you would worship me.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",And so have you!
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Let the lesson begin!
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","(Apollo grows as tall as
his temple.)"
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Welcome to Olympus, Captain Kirk."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I want from you that which is rightfully mine.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Your loyalty,
your tribute, and your worship."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Life in paradise.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","As simple and as pleasureful as it was those
thousands of years ago on that beautiful planet so far away."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Agamemnon was one such as you, and Hercules."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Pride and
arrogance."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",They defied me until they felt my wrath.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","No, you do not, Captain."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",They are mine.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","To save, to cherish, or
to destroy at my will."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",How like Aphrodite and Athena.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","The beauty, grace."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","And you seem
wise for a woman."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",What is your name?
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I mean your name.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Carolyn.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Yes.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You are beautiful.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You would do Aphrodite credit.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I will tell you a thousand tales, stories of courage and love."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You will
know what it is to be a goddess."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You protest?
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You risk much.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I've grown weary of discussion and argument.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",None of your toys will function.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Yes.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You are a beauty.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","But
like Artemis, the bow arm should be bare."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Yes.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Come.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",(he takes her hand and leads her away)
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",He shall learn the discipline of the temple.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",So shall you all.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Come.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Without fear.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",She is fit indeed.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I've known other women.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Daphne, Cassandra, but none more
beautiful than you."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Are you frightened of me?
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",A god?
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",They returned to the cosmos on the wings of the wind.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","No, not as you understand it."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We're immortal, we gods."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","But the
Earth changed."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Your fathers changed.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","They turned away until we were
only memories."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",A god cannot survive as a memory.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We need love,
admiration, worship, as you need food."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","In a real sense, we were gods."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We had the power of life and
death."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",We could have struck out from Olympus and destroyed.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We have no
wish to destroy, so we came home again."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","It was an empty place without
worshippers, but we had no strength to leave, so we waited, all of us,
through the long years."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Even for a god, there's a point of no return."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Hera was first.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","She stood in front of the temple and spread herself upon the wind,
thinner and thinner, until only the wind remained."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","But I knew you would
come."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You striving, bickering, foolishly brave humans."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I knew you would
come to the stars one day."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Of all the gods, I knew and I waited, waited
for you to come and sit by my side."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Even five thousand years ago, the gods took mortals to them to
love, to care for, like Zeus took Leto, my mother."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We were gods of
passion, of love."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",She is no longer of any concern to you.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You will learn discipline.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You will learn
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Come here!
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I know you're trying to escape me.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",It's useless.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I
know everything you do."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I tried to be compassionate toward your kind.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",But you're of the same nature.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I could sweep you out of
existence with a wave of my hand and bring you back again."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I can give
life or death."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",What else does mankind demand of its gods?
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","We shall not debate, mortal."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I offer you eternal rest and
happiness according to the ancient ways."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I ask little in return, but
what I ask for I insist upon."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Approach me.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","(the four men turn their
backs on him) I said approach me!"
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You will gather laurel leaves, light the ancient fires, kill a
deer, make your sacrifices to me."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Apollo has spoken!
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You shall reap the rewards of your insolence!
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Mortal, you have earned this!"
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I shall be lenient with you, for her sake."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You will make plans
to bring the rest of your people down."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Be sure your artisans bring
tools."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You will need homes.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You will dismantle your ship for the supplies you need, and
I'll crush its empty hull."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I have been too patient.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I shall be patient
no longer."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Fools.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I offer them more than they could
know."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Not just a world, but all that makes it up."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Man thinks he's
progressed."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",They're wrong.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",He's merely forgotten those things which gave life meaning.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You'll all
be provided for, cared for, happy."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","There is an order of things in this
universe."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Your species has denied it.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I come to restore it.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","And for
you, because you have the sensitivity to understand, I offer you more
than your wildest dreams have ever imagined."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You'll become the mother
of a new race of gods."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You'll inspire the universe.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",All men will revere you almost as a god yourself.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","And I shall love you
for time without end, worlds without end."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","You shall complete me, and I
you."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",My what?
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I am Apollo.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I've chosen you.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Your work?
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I don't believe it.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You love me.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Carolyn!
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I forbid you to go.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I order you to stay.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",No!
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Stop!
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Stop, I say!"
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Stop!
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Stop, I say!"
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",(the temple is now yellow) I command it!
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Stop!
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Stop!
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Stop!
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I would have cherished you, cared for you."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I would have loved
you as a father loves his children."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Did I ask so much?
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Carolyn, I loved you."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",I would have made a goddess of you.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I've
shown you my open heart."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",See what you've done to me.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Zeus, Hermes, Hera, Aphrodite."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",You were right.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Athena, you were
right."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",The time has passed.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",There is no room for gods.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Forgive me, my
old friends."
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Take me.
APOLLO,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Take me.
KYLE,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Transporter and communications?
KYLE,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Aye sir.
KYLE,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","I've located the landing party, but one of them seems separated
from the other four."
KYLE,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Yes, sir."
KYLE,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","What for, sir?"
KYLE,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?","Right away, sir."
ALL,"Who
Mourns For Adonais?",Ha ha ha ha.
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Oh, Captain."
MCCOY,Amok Time,Got a minute?
MCCOY,Amok Time,It's Spock.
MCCOY,Amok Time,Have you noticed anything strange about him?
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Well, it's nothing I can pinpoint without an examination, but he's become increasingly restive."
MCCOY,Amok Time,"If he were not a Vulcan, I'd almost say nervous."
MCCOY,Amok Time,"And for another thing, he's avoiding food."
MCCOY,Amok Time,I checked and he hasn't eaten at all in three days.
MCCOY,Amok Time,Miss Chapel.
MCCOY,Amok Time,Captain.
MCCOY,Amok Time,What's this?
MCCOY,Amok Time,Oh!
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Vulcan plomeek soup, and I'll bet you made it too."
MCCOY,Amok Time,"You never give up hoping, do you?"
MCCOY,Amok Time,It's all right.
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Carry on, Miss Chapel."
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Jim, when I suggested to Spock that it was time for his routine check-up, your logical, unemotional first officer turned to me and said, you will cease to pry into my personal matters, Doctor, or I shall certainly break your neck."
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Come in, Spock."
MCCOY,Amok Time,I'm all ready for you.
MCCOY,Amok Time,My orders were to give you a thorough physical.
MCCOY,Amok Time,"In case you hadn't noticed, I have to answer to the same commanding officer that you do."
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Come on, Spock."
MCCOY,Amok Time,Yield to the logic of the situation.
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Jim, you've got to get Spock to Vulcan."
MCCOY,Amok Time,No!
MCCOY,Amok Time,Now.
MCCOY,Amok Time,Right away.
MCCOY,Amok Time,"If you don't get him to Vulcan within a week eight days at the outside, he'll die."
MCCOY,Amok Time,"He'll die, Jim."
MCCOY,Amok Time,I don't know.
MCCOY,Amok Time,"There's a growing imbalance of body functions, as if in our bodies huge amounts of adrenalin were constantly being pumped into our bloodstreams."
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Now, I can't trace it down in my biocomps."
MCCOY,Amok Time,Spock won't tell me what it is.
MCCOY,Amok Time,"But if it isn't stopped somehow, the physical and emotional pressures will simply kill him."
MCCOY,Amok Time,"He does, and he's as tightlipped about it as an Aldebaran Shellmouth."
MCCOY,Amok Time,"No use to ask him, Jim."
MCCOY,Amok Time,He won't talk.
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Well, that's that."
MCCOY,Amok Time,You can't go off to Vulcan against Starfleet orders.
MCCOY,Amok Time,You'll be busted
MCCOY,Amok Time,"I shall be honoured, sir."
MCCOY,Amok Time,He called it Koon-ut what?
MCCOY,Amok Time,They still go mad at this time.
MCCOY,Amok Time,Perhaps it's the price they pay for having no emotions the rest of the time.
MCCOY,Amok Time,Yeah.
MCCOY,Amok Time,Hot as Vulcan.
MCCOY,Amok Time,Now I understand what that phrase means.
MCCOY,Amok Time,I wonder when his T'Pring arrives.
MCCOY,Amok Time,T'Pau.
MCCOY,Amok Time,Officiating at Spock's wedding?
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Leonard McCoy, ma'am."
MCCOY,Amok Time,(pointing at T'Pau's bodyguard) With him?
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Ma'am, I don't understand."
MCCOY,Amok Time,Are you trying to say that she rejected him?
MCCOY,Amok Time,That she doesn't want him?
MCCOY,Amok Time,I doubt it.
MCCOY,Amok Time,Not in his present condition.
MCCOY,Amok Time,"You can't do it, Jim."
MCCOY,Amok Time,No.
MCCOY,Amok Time,She said their laws and customs were not binding on you.
MCCOY,Amok Time,In this climate?
MCCOY,Amok Time,"If the heat doesn't get you, the thin air will."
MCCOY,Amok Time,You can't do it!
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Jim, listen, if you"
MCCOY,Amok Time,These men are friends.
MCCOY,Amok Time,To force them to fight until one of them is killed
MCCOY,Amok Time,Spock!
MCCOY,Amok Time,No!
MCCOY,Amok Time,Is this Vulcan chivalry?
MCCOY,Amok Time,The air's too hot and thin for Kirk.
MCCOY,Amok Time,He's not used to it.
MCCOY,Amok Time,(holding up a hypo) I can compensate for the atmosphere and the temperature with this.
MCCOY,Amok Time,At least it'll give Kirk a fighting chance.
MCCOY,Amok Time,"You're going to have to kill him, Jim."
MCCOY,Amok Time,It's a tri-ox compound.
MCCOY,Amok Time,It'll help you breathe.
MCCOY,Amok Time,Now be careful!
MCCOY,Amok Time,McCoy to Enterprise.
MCCOY,Amok Time,Have the transporter room stand by to beam up the landing party.
MCCOY,Amok Time,"(ends communication) As strange as it may seem, Mister Spock, you're in command now."
MCCOY,Amok Time,Any orders?
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Spock, I"
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Spock, I"
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Nurse, would you mind, please?"
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Spock, what happened down there?"
MCCOY,Amok Time,The girl?
MCCOY,Amok Time,The wedding?
MCCOY,Amok Time,"There's just one thing, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Amok Time,You can't tell me that when you first saw Jim alive that you weren't on the verge of giving us an emotional scene that would have brought the house down.
MCCOY,Amok Time,.
MCCOY,Amok Time,"Of course, Mister Spock, your reaction was quite logical."
MCCOY,Amok Time,In a pig's eye!
KIRK,Amok Time,A minute.
KIRK,Amok Time,"No, nothing in particular."
KIRK,Amok Time,Why ?
KIRK,Amok Time,That just sounds like Mister Spock in one of his contemplative phases.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Bones, I'm a busy man."
KIRK,Amok Time,Spock said that?
KIRK,Amok Time,"Spock, what the devil is this all about?"
KIRK,Amok Time,"All right, Spock, let's have it."
KIRK,Amok Time,I'm more interested in your request for shore leave.
KIRK,Amok Time,In all the years
KIRK,Amok Time,"In all the years that I've known you, you've never asked for a leave of any sort."
KIRK,Amok Time,"In fact, you've refused them."
KIRK,Amok Time,Why now?
KIRK,Amok Time,"Agreed, but that isn't the question, is it?"
KIRK,Amok Time,"If there's a problem of some sort, illness in the family"
KIRK,Amok Time,"Then since we're headed for Altair Six, and since the shore facilities there are excellent"
KIRK,Amok Time,"Spock, I'm asking you."
KIRK,Amok Time,What's wrong?
KIRK,Amok Time,Bridge.
KIRK,Amok Time,Helm.
KIRK,Amok Time,Alter course to Vulcan.
KIRK,Amok Time,Increase speed to warp four.
KIRK,Amok Time,I suppose most of us overlook the fact that even Vulcans aren't indestructible.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Put it on audio over here, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Amok Time,"Lieutenant Uhura, acknowledge that message."
KIRK,Amok Time,"Mister Chekov, compute course and speed necessary for compliance."
KIRK,Amok Time,Head directly for Altair Six.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Sailor's luck, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Amok Time,"Or, as one of Finagle's Laws puts it, 'Any home port the ship makes ill be somebody else's, not mine'."
KIRK,Amok Time,"The new president of Altair Six wants to get himself launched a week early, so we have to be there a week early."
KIRK,Amok Time,Don't worry.
KIRK,Amok Time,I'll see that you get your leave as soon as we're finished.
KIRK,Amok Time,Bridge.
KIRK,Amok Time,Navigation.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Mister Chekov, how late will we arrive for the ceremonies if we increase speed to maximum and divert to Vulcan just long enough to drop off Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Amok Time,How far behind schedule will diverting to Vulcan put us?
KIRK,Amok Time,"Thank you, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Amok Time,"Kirk, out."
KIRK,Amok Time,Mister Spock.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Come with me, please."
KIRK,Amok Time,Deck five.
KIRK,Amok Time,"You've changed course for Vulcan, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Amok Time,Why?
KIRK,Amok Time,Do you deny it?
KIRK,Amok Time,Then why'd you do it?
KIRK,Amok Time,"I'm trying to help you, Spock."
KIRK,Amok Time,I order you to report to the Sickbay.
KIRK,Amok Time,Complete examination.
KIRK,Amok Time,McCoy's waiting.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Bones, I will, I will."
KIRK,Amok Time,As soon as this mission is
KIRK,Amok Time,Why must he die?
KIRK,Amok Time,Why within eight days?
KIRK,Amok Time,Explain.
KIRK,Amok Time,You keep saying that.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Are you a doctor, or aren't you?"
KIRK,Amok Time,You say you're convinced he knows what it is?
KIRK,Amok Time,Stay.
KIRK,Amok Time,McCoy has given me his medical evaluation of your condition.
KIRK,Amok Time,He says you're going to die unless something is done.
KIRK,Amok Time,What?
KIRK,Amok Time,Is it something only your planet can do for you?
KIRK,Amok Time,Spock!
KIRK,Amok Time,You've been called the best first officer in the fleet.
KIRK,Amok Time,That's an enormous asset to me.
KIRK,Amok Time,"If I have to lose that first officer, I want to know why."
KIRK,Amok Time,"No, I do not understand."
KIRK,Amok Time,Explain.
KIRK,Amok Time,Consider that an order.
KIRK,Amok Time,Would it help if I told you that I'll treat this as totally confidential?
KIRK,Amok Time,What?
KIRK,Amok Time,What kind of biology?
KIRK,Amok Time,You mean the biology of Vulcans?
KIRK,Amok Time,Biology as in reproduction?
KIRK,Amok Time,"Well, there's no need to be embarrassed about it, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Amok Time,It happens to the birds and the bees.
KIRK,Amok Time,I guess the rest of us assume that it's done quite logically.
KIRK,Amok Time,"But you're not a fish, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Amok Time,You're
KIRK,Amok Time,"I haven't heard a word you've said, and I'll get you to Vulcan somehow."
KIRK,Amok Time,"Lieutenant, get me Admiral Komack at Starfleet Command, Sector Nine."
KIRK,Amok Time,Pipe it down to McCoy's office.
KIRK,Amok Time,"I'm aware of that, sir, but it's of the utmost importance."
KIRK,Amok Time,You must give me permission to divert to Vulcan.
KIRK,Amok Time,"I can't, sir, but believe me, I wouldn't make such a request"
KIRK,Amok Time,"Sir, the delay would be, at most, a day."
KIRK,Amok Time,I can hardly believe that
KIRK,Amok Time,"No, it's not."
KIRK,Amok Time,I know the Altair situation.
KIRK,Amok Time,We would be one of three starships.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Very impressive, very diplomatic, but it's simply not that vital."
KIRK,Amok Time,"I can't let Spock die, can I, Bones?"
KIRK,Amok Time,And he will if we go to Altair.
KIRK,Amok Time,I owe him my life a dozen times over.
KIRK,Amok Time,Isn't that worth a career?
KIRK,Amok Time,He's my friend.
KIRK,Amok Time,Bridge.
KIRK,Amok Time,Navigation.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Vulcan."
KIRK,Amok Time,Tell Engineering I want warp eight or better.
KIRK,Amok Time,Push her for all she'll take.
KIRK,Amok Time,I see.
KIRK,Amok Time,Very well.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Carry on, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Amok Time,"Kirk, out."
KIRK,Amok Time,Bridge.
KIRK,Amok Time,Will I?
KIRK,Amok Time,You've been most patient with my kinds of madness.
KIRK,Amok Time,Is it permitted?
KIRK,Amok Time,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Amok Time,"Open the channel, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Amok Time,"Vulcan Space Central, this is the USS Enterprise requesting permission to assume standard orbit."
KIRK,Amok Time,He described it to me as meaning marriage or challenge.
KIRK,Amok Time,"In the distant past, Vulcans killed to win their mates."
KIRK,Amok Time,It's lovely.
KIRK,Amok Time,I wish the breeze were cooler.
KIRK,Amok Time,The atmosphere is thinner than Earth.
KIRK,Amok Time,Marriage party?
KIRK,Amok Time,You said T'Pring was your wife.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Bones, you know who that is?"
KIRK,Amok Time,T'Pau.
KIRK,Amok Time,The only person to ever turn down a seat on the Federation Council.
KIRK,Amok Time,He never mentioned that his family was this important.
KIRK,Amok Time,Ma'am.
KIRK,Amok Time,What is it?
KIRK,Amok Time,What happened?
KIRK,Amok Time,Spock?
KIRK,Amok Time,We'll stay.
KIRK,Amok Time,Think Spock can take him?
KIRK,Amok Time,What happens to Spock if I decline?
KIRK,Amok Time,I can't?
KIRK,Amok Time,And you said Spock might not be able to handle him.
KIRK,Amok Time,If I can knock Spock out without really hurting him
KIRK,Amok Time,"If I get into any trouble, I'll quit."
KIRK,Amok Time,"And Spock wins, and honour is satisfied."
KIRK,Amok Time,Bones.
KIRK,Amok Time,He's my first officer and my friend.
KIRK,Amok Time,I disregarded Starfleet orders to bring him here.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Another thing, that's T'Pau of Vulcan."
KIRK,Amok Time,All of Vulcan in one package.
KIRK,Amok Time,How can I back out in front of her?
KIRK,Amok Time,I accept the challenge.
KIRK,Amok Time,"What do you mean, if both survive?"
KIRK,Amok Time,"Now wait a minute, ma'am."
KIRK,Amok Time,Who said anything about a fight to the death?
KIRK,Amok Time,Kill Spock?
KIRK,Amok Time,"That's not what I came to Vulcan for, is it?"
KIRK,Amok Time,What's that?
KIRK,Amok Time,Sound medical advice.
KIRK,Amok Time,Don't you think you better check with me first?
KIRK,Amok Time,Blame McCoy.
KIRK,Amok Time,That was no tri-ox compound he shot me with.
KIRK,Amok Time,He slipped in a neural paralyser.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Knocked me out, simulated death."
KIRK,Amok Time,Kirk here.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Relay it, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Amok Time,"Well, a little late, but I'm glad they're seeing it our way."
KIRK,Amok Time,How about that T'Pau?
KIRK,Amok Time,They couldn't turn her down.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Altair Six."
KIRK,Amok Time,Leave orbit when ready.
KIRK,Amok Time,Kirk out.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Yes, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Amok Time,I understand.
KIRK,Amok Time,"Come on, Spock."
KIRK,Amok Time,Let's go mind the store.
CHAPEL,Amok Time,(carrying a tray and sounding embarrassed) Doctor McCoy.
CHAPEL,Amok Time,Captain.
CHAPEL,Amok Time,Oh.
CHAPEL,Amok Time,"Well, Mister Spock hasn't been eating, Doctor, and I, I just happened to notice."
CHAPEL,Amok Time,"Yes, Mister Spock?"
CHAPEL,Amok Time,I don't understand.
CHAPEL,Amok Time,I came to tell you that we are bound for Vulcan.
CHAPEL,Amok Time,We'll be there in just a few days.
CHAPEL,Amok Time,My name is Christine.
CHAPEL,Amok Time,"Oh, I'd be very glad to do that, Mister Spock."
CHAPEL,Amok Time,"Doctor, what's going on?"
SPOCK,Amok Time,What is this?
SPOCK,Amok Time,Poking and prying!
SPOCK,Amok Time,"If I want anything from you, I'll ask for it!"
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Captain, I should like to request a leave of absence on my home planet."
SPOCK,Amok Time,On our present course you can divert to Vulcan with a loss of but two point eight light days.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"I have made my request, Captain."
SPOCK,Amok Time,All I require from you is that you answer it.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Yes or no.
SPOCK,Amok Time,It is undignified for a woman to play servant to a man who is not hers.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"You have my request, Captain."
SPOCK,Amok Time,Will you grant it or not?
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Captain, surely I have enough leave time accumulated."
SPOCK,Amok Time,No.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Nothing of that nature, Captain."
SPOCK,Amok Time,No!
SPOCK,Amok Time,I must.
SPOCK,Amok Time,I wish to take my leave on Vulcan.
SPOCK,Amok Time,I need rest.
SPOCK,Amok Time,I'm asking you to accept that answer.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Thank you, Captain."
SPOCK,Amok Time,No.
SPOCK,Amok Time,(looking at his shaking hand) We're not.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"I quite understand, Captain."
SPOCK,Amok Time,Changed the course?
SPOCK,Amok Time,No.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"No, by no means, Captain."
SPOCK,Amok Time,It is quite possible.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Captain, I accept on your word that I did it, but I do not know why, nor do I remember doing it."
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Captain, lock me away."
SPOCK,Amok Time,I do not wish to be seen.
SPOCK,Amok Time,I cannot.
SPOCK,Amok Time,No Vulcan could explain further.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Ask me no further questions.
SPOCK,Amok Time,I will not answer.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Sickbay?
SPOCK,Amok Time,"My orders were to report to Sickbay, Doctor."
SPOCK,Amok Time,I have done so.
SPOCK,Amok Time,And now I'll go to my quarters.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Examine me, for all the good it'll do either of us."
SPOCK,Amok Time,Come.
SPOCK,Amok Time,It is a thing no out-worlder may know except those very few who have been involved.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"A Vulcan understands, but even we do not speak of it among ourselves."
SPOCK,Amok Time,It is a deeply personal thing.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Can you see that, Captain, and understand?"
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Captain, there are some things which transcend even the discipline of the service."
SPOCK,Amok Time,It has to do with biology.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Biology.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Vulcan biology.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"The birds and the bees are not Vulcans, Captain."
SPOCK,Amok Time,"If they were, if any creature as proudly logical as us were to have their logic ripped from them as this time does to us."
SPOCK,Amok Time,How do Vulcans choose their mates?
SPOCK,Amok Time,Haven't you wondered?
SPOCK,Amok Time,No.
SPOCK,Amok Time,No.
SPOCK,Amok Time,It is not.
SPOCK,Amok Time,We shield it with ritual and customs shrouded in antiquity.
SPOCK,Amok Time,You humans have no conception.
SPOCK,Amok Time,It strips our minds from us.
SPOCK,Amok Time,It brings a madness which rips away our veneer of civilisation.
SPOCK,Amok Time,It is the pon farr.
SPOCK,Amok Time,The time of mating.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"There are precedents in nature, Captain."
SPOCK,Amok Time,"The giant eelbirds of Regulus Five, once each eleven years they must return to the caverns where they hatched."
SPOCK,Amok Time,"On your Earth, the salmon."
SPOCK,Amok Time,"They must return to that one stream where they were born, to spawn or die in trying."
SPOCK,Amok Time,No.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Nor am I a man.
SPOCK,Amok Time,I'm a Vulcan.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"I'd hoped I would be spared this, but the ancient drives are too strong."
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Eventually, they catch up with us, and we are driven by forces we cannot control to return home and take a wife."
SPOCK,Amok Time,Or die.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Let me alone.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Let me alone!
SPOCK,Amok Time,Miss Chapel.
SPOCK,Amok Time,I had a most startling dream.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"You were trying to tell me something, but I couldn't hear you."
SPOCK,Amok Time,It would be illogical for us to protest against our natures.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Don't you think?
SPOCK,Amok Time,Your face is wet.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Vulcan.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Miss Chapel.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Yes, I know, Christine."
SPOCK,Amok Time,Would you make me some of that plomeek soup?
SPOCK,Amok Time,"It is obvious that you have surmised my problem, Doctor."
SPOCK,Amok Time,My compliments on your insight.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Captain, there is a thing that happens to Vulcans at this time."
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Almost an insanity, which you would no doubt find distasteful."
SPOCK,Amok Time,Then would you beam down to the planet's surface and stand with me?
SPOCK,Amok Time,There is a brief ceremony.
SPOCK,Amok Time,It is my right.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"By tradition, the male is accompanied by his closest friends."
SPOCK,Amok Time,I also request McCoy accompany me.
SPOCK,Amok Time,This is Spock.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"T'Pring, parted from me and never parted, never and always touching and touched."
SPOCK,Amok Time,We meet at the appointed place.
SPOCK,Amok Time,She is T'Pring.
SPOCK,Amok Time,My wife.
SPOCK,Amok Time,This is the land of my family.
SPOCK,Amok Time,It has been held by us for more than two thousand Earth years.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"This is our place of Koon-ut-kal-if-fee,"
SPOCK,Amok Time,The marriage party approaches.
SPOCK,Amok Time,I hear them.
SPOCK,Amok Time,By our parents' arrangement.
SPOCK,Amok Time,A ceremony while we were but seven years of age.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Less than a marriage but more than a betrothal.
SPOCK,Amok Time,One touches the other in order to feel each other's thoughts.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"In this way our minds were locked together, so that at the proper time, we would both be drawn to Koon-ut-kal-if-fee."
SPOCK,Amok Time,They are not outworlders.
SPOCK,Amok Time,They are my friends.
SPOCK,Amok Time,I am permitted this.
SPOCK,Amok Time,This is Kirk.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"With my life, T'Pau."
SPOCK,Amok Time,T'Pau.
SPOCK,Amok Time,My friend does not understand.
SPOCK,Amok Time,He does not know.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"I will do what I must, T'Pau, but not with him!"
SPOCK,Amok Time,His blood does not burn.
SPOCK,Amok Time,He is my friend!
SPOCK,Amok Time,"I burn, T'Pau."
SPOCK,Amok Time,My eyes are flame.
SPOCK,Amok Time,My heart is flame.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Thee has the power, T'Pau."
SPOCK,Amok Time,"In the name of my fathers, forbid."
SPOCK,Amok Time,Forbid!
SPOCK,Amok Time,T'Pau.
SPOCK,Amok Time,I plead with thee!
SPOCK,Amok Time,I beg!
SPOCK,Amok Time,Yes.
SPOCK,Amok Time,I'll follow you up in a few minutes.
SPOCK,Amok Time,You will instruct Mister Chekov to plot a course for the nearest Starbase where I must surrender myself to the authorities.
SPOCK,Amok Time,(the sound of a transporter off screen) T'Pring.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Explain.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Why the challenge, and why you chose my captain as your champion."
SPOCK,Amok Time,I see no logic in preferring Stonn over me.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Logical.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Flawlessly logical.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Stonn.
SPOCK,Amok Time,She is yours.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"After a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting."
SPOCK,Amok Time,"It is not logical, but it is often true."
SPOCK,Amok Time,Spock here.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Stand by to beam up.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Live long, T'Pau, and prosper."
SPOCK,Amok Time,I shall do neither.
SPOCK,Amok Time,I have killed my captain and my friend.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Energize.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Doctor, I shall be resigning my commission immediately, of course."
SPOCK,Amok Time,So I would appreciate your making the final arrangements.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Doctor, please, let me finish."
SPOCK,Amok Time,There can be no excuse for the crime of which I'm guilty.
SPOCK,Amok Time,I intend to offer no defence.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Furthermore, I shall order Mister Scott to take immediate command of this vessel."
SPOCK,Amok Time,Captain!
SPOCK,Amok Time,Jim!
SPOCK,Amok Time,"I'm pleased to see you, Captain."
SPOCK,Amok Time,You seem uninjured.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"I am at something of a loss to understand it, however."
SPOCK,Amok Time,Indeed.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Ah, yes, the girl."
SPOCK,Amok Time,Most interesting.
SPOCK,Amok Time,It must have been the combat.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"When I thought I had killed the captain, I found I had lost all interest in T'Pring."
SPOCK,Amok Time,The madness was gone.
SPOCK,Amok Time,Merely my quite logical relief that Starfleet had not lost a highly proficient captain.
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Thank you, Captain."
SPOCK,Amok Time,"Thank you, Doctor."
SULU,Amok Time,"Yes, Captain?"
SULU,Amok Time,"Aye, sir."
SULU,Amok Time,"How do you figure it, Chekov?"
SULU,Amok Time,"First we're going to Vulcan, then we're going to Altair, then we're headed to Vulcan again, and now we're headed back to Altair."
SULU,Amok Time,"Maybe you ought to plot a course back for Vulcan, just in case."
UHURA,Amok Time,"Captain, something's coming in on the Starfleet channel."
UHURA,Amok Time,"Priority and urgent, sir."
UHURA,Amok Time,"Message complete, sir."
UHURA,Amok Time,Switching over.
UHURA,Amok Time,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,Amok Time,Starfleet Command.
UHURA,Amok Time,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,Amok Time,Communication to Mister Spock.
UHURA,Amok Time,Lieutenant Uhura here.
UHURA,Amok Time,The captain asked me to
UHURA,Amok Time,Captain.
UHURA,Amok Time,"We're standing by on Vulcan hailing frequencies, sir."
UHURA,Amok Time,"She's lovely, Mister Spock."
UHURA,Amok Time,Who is she?
UHURA,Amok Time,Enterprise.
UHURA,Amok Time,Lieutenant Uhura here.
UHURA,Amok Time,Captain Kirk.
UHURA,Amok Time,"Message from Starfleet Command, top priority."
UHURA,Amok Time,Response to T'Pau's request for diversion of Enterprise to planet Vulcan
UHURA,Amok Time,Hereby approved.
UHURA,Amok Time,Any reasonable delay granted.
UHURA,Amok Time,"Komack, Admiral, Starfleet Command."
STARFLEET,Amok Time,"To Captain, USS Enterprise from Starfleet Sector Nine."
STARFLEET,Amok Time,"Inauguration ceremonies, Altair Six, have been advanced seven solar days."
STARFLEET,Amok Time,"You are ordered to alter your flight plan to accommodate, by order of Komack, Admiral, Starfleet Command."
STARFLEET,Amok Time,Acknowledge.
CHEKOV,Amok Time,"(a bit of a Russian accent) We'll have to head directly there at warp six, sir."
CHEKOV,Amok Time,Insufficient time to stop off at Vulcan.
CHEKOV,Amok Time,Navigation.
CHEKOV,Amok Time,Chekov here.
CHEKOV,Amok Time,"I don't understand, Captain."
CHEKOV,Amok Time,"We're on course for Vulcan, Captain, as Mister Spock ordered."
CHEKOV,Amok Time,I think I'm going to get space sick.
CHEKOV,Amok Time,"Mister Sulu, you don't think"
CHEKOV,Amok Time,Bridge.
CHEKOV,Amok Time,Navigation.
CHEKOV,Amok Time,Course already plotted.
CHEKOV,Amok Time,"Laying it in, sir."
KOMACK,Amok Time,"Captain, you're making a most unusual request."
KOMACK,Amok Time,But you refuse to explain why it is so important.
KOMACK,Amok Time,Altair Six is no ordinary matter.
KOMACK,Amok Time,That area is just putting itself together after a long interplanetary conflict.
KOMACK,Amok Time,This inauguration will stabilise the entire Altair system.
KOMACK,Amok Time,Our appearance there is a demonstration of friendship and strength which will cause ripples clear to the Klingon Empire.
KOMACK,Amok Time,You will proceed to Altair Six as ordered.
KOMACK,Amok Time,You have your orders.
KOMACK,Amok Time,Starfleet out.
VULCAN,Amok Time,USS Enterprise from Vulcan Space Central.
VULCAN,Amok Time,Permission granted.
VULCAN,Amok Time,"And from all of Vulcan, welcome."
VULCAN,Amok Time,Is Commander Spock with you?
VULCAN,Amok Time,"Standby to activate your central viewer, please."
T'PRING,Amok Time,"Spock, it is I."
T'PRING,Amok Time,"Spock, parted from me and never parted, never and always touching and touched."
T'PRING,Amok Time,I await you.
T'PRING,Amok Time,Kal-if-fee!
T'PRING,Amok Time,I am prepared.
T'PRING,Amok Time,"As it was in the dawn of our days, as it is today, as it will be for all tomorrows, I make my choice."
T'PRING,Amok Time,This one.
T'PRING,Amok Time,Specify.
T'PRING,Amok Time,"Stonn wanted me, I wanted him."
T'PRING,Amok Time,"You have become much known among our people, Spock."
T'PRING,Amok Time,Almost a legend.
T'PRING,Amok Time,"And as the years went by, I came to know that I did not want to be the consort of a legend."
T'PRING,Amok Time,"But by the laws of our people, I could only divorce you by the kal-if-fee."
T'PRING,Amok Time,"There was also Stonn, who wanted very much to be my consort, and I wanted him."
T'PRING,Amok Time,"If your Captain were victor, he would not want me, and so I would have Stonn."
T'PRING,Amok Time,"If you were victor you would free me because I had dared to challenge, and again I would have Stonn."
T'PRING,Amok Time,"But if you did not free me, it would be the same."
T'PRING,Amok Time,"For you would be gone, and I would have your name and your property, and Stonn would still be there."
T'PRING,Amok Time,I am honoured.
T'PAU,Amok Time,"Spock, are our ceremonies for outworlders?"
T'PAU,Amok Time,And thee are called?
T'PAU,Amok Time,Thee names these out worlders friends.
T'PAU,Amok Time,How does thee pledge their behaviour?
T'PAU,Amok Time,"What they are about to see comes down from the time of the beginning, without change."
T'PAU,Amok Time,This is the Vulcan heart.
T'PAU,Amok Time,This is the Vulcan soul.
T'PAU,Amok Time,This is our way.
T'PAU,Amok Time,Kah-if-farr.
T'PAU,Amok Time,She chooses the challenge.
T'PAU,Amok Time,He acts only if cowardice is seen.
T'PAU,Amok Time,She will choose her champion.
T'PAU,Amok Time,"Do not attempt to speak with him, Kirk."
T'PAU,Amok Time,"He is deep in the plak-tow, the blood fever."
T'PAU,Amok Time,He will not speak with thee again until he has passed through what is to come.
T'PAU,Amok Time,"If thee wishes to depart, thee may leave now."
T'PAU,Amok Time,Spock chose his friends well.
T'PAU,Amok Time,He will have to fight for her.
T'PAU,Amok Time,It is her right.
T'PAU,Amok Time,"T'Pring, thee has chosen the kal-if-fee, the challenge."
T'PAU,Amok Time,Thee are prepared to become the property of the victor?
T'PAU,Amok Time,"Spock, does thee accept the challenge according to our laws and customs?"
T'PAU,Amok Time,"T'Pring, thee will choose thy champion."
T'PAU,Amok Time,Be silent.
T'PAU,Amok Time,Kroykah!
T'PAU,Amok Time,Kirk?
T'PAU,Amok Time,"T'Pring is within her rights, but our laws and customs are not binding on thee."
T'PAU,Amok Time,Thee are free to decline with no harm on thyself.
T'PAU,Amok Time,Thee speaks?
T'PAU,Amok Time,"The choice has been made, Spock."
T'PAU,Amok Time,It is up to him now.
T'PAU,Amok Time,It is said thy Vulcan blood is thin.
T'PAU,Amok Time,Are thee Vulcan or are thee human?
T'PAU,Amok Time,Thee has prided thyself on thy Vulcan heritage.
T'PAU,Amok Time,It is decided.
T'PAU,Amok Time,Another champion will be selected.
T'PAU,Amok Time,"Do not interfere, Kirk."
T'PAU,Amok Time,Keep thy place.
T'PAU,Amok Time,It is done.
T'PAU,Amok Time,"Kirk, decide."
T'PAU,Amok Time,"Here begins the act of combat for possession of the woman, T'Pring."
T'PAU,Amok Time,"As it was at the time of the beginning, so it is now."
T'PAU,Amok Time,Bring forth the lirpa.
T'PAU,Amok Time,"If both survive the lirpa, combat will continue with the ahn woon."
T'PAU,Amok Time,This combat is to the death.
T'PAU,Amok Time,I can forgive such a display only once.
T'PAU,Amok Time,Challenge was given and lawfully accepted.
T'PAU,Amok Time,It has begun.
T'PAU,Amok Time,Let no one interfere.
T'PAU,Amok Time,Kroykah!
T'PAU,Amok Time,The air is the air.
T'PAU,Amok Time,What can be done?
T'PAU,Amok Time,Thee may proceed.
T'PAU,Amok Time,The ahn woon.
T'PAU,Amok Time,Kroykah!
T'PAU,Amok Time,I grieve with thee.
T'PAU,Amok Time,"Live long and prosper, Spock."
STONN,Amok Time,No!
STONN,Amok Time,I am to be the one.
STONN,Amok Time,It was agreed.
STONN,Amok Time,Hear me.
STONN,Amok Time,I have made the ancient claim.
STONN,Amok Time,I claim the right.
STONN,Amok Time,The woman is
STONN,Amok Time,I ask forgiveness.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,The distress call definitely came from one of the solar systems in this sector.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,Negative.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"It was so badly garbled all we got was the name Constellation, then we lost it."
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"Sir, I'm picking up a ship's disaster beacon."
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"No answer, Captain."
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,All I get is the automatic beacon.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,Red alert.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,Red alert.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,Man your battle stations.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"I can't raise the Constellation, sir."
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"I'm still getting the distress beacon, but there's heavy subspace interference."
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,It's almost blocking the signal.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, aye, sir."
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, communication's damaged."
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,We're unable to override interference.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"(to Spock) Sir, Deck seven reports power failure in main energisers."
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,Implementing emergency procedures.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,(another hit) Severe casualties reported on decks three and four.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,Damage control party sealing off inner hull rupture.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, we've pierced the interference locally."
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"No, sir, but I've got ship-to-ship communications back."
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,Picking up Captain Kirk.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,Enterprise to shuttlecraft.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"Come in, shuttlecraft."
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,Enterprise to shuttlecraft.
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"Come in, shuttlecraft."
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"Come in, shuttlecraft."
PALMER,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, the transporter is now operational."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Can you pinpoint it any closer, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,But that's incredible.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,The star in this system is still intact.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Only a nova could destroy like that.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Continue a search pattern.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Every solar system in this sector blasted to rubble and still no sign of the Constellation.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Matt Decker's in command.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What could have happened to him?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Try to raise it, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Approach course, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,It's the Constellation.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Look at that.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,She was attacked.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Red alert!
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Red alert!
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Man your battle stations!
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Mister Sulu?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Very good.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Initiate a full sensor scan of the immediate area for any other vessel.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Lieutenant Palmer.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Keep trying.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, full evaluation of the damage to the Constellation."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Life support systems?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Radiation levels?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"All hands, go to Yellow Alert."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Stand by battle stations.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Lieutenant, have Doctor McCoy, Mister Scott, and a damage control party report to me in the transporter room."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,We're going to board her.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, you're in command."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Scotty, check the phaser banks."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,See if they've been fired.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Bones, you come with me."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"No clutter, no half-empty cups of coffee."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Whatever happened didn't happen without a warning.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"The crew wasn't abducted, they just left."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"No survivors, no bodies either."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Is it possible they could have beamed down to one of the two planets?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,We'll continue our search.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Phaser banks?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,But where are they?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,I can't imagine a man like Matt Decker abandoning ship while his life support systems were still operative.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Matt.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Matt, it's Jim Kirk."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Matt?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Matt.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"What happened to your ship, Matt?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What thing?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What was it?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Answer me!
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What was it?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"What happened, Matt?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Go.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,The fourth planet.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Only two left now.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Scotty, pull the microtapes from the sensor memory banks and beam them aboard to Spock."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"I want a full analysis, a complete report of what happened when they went in on that planet."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What happened to your crew?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What hit?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What attacked you?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Matt, where's your crew?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,There is no third planet.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Go.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Deactivated?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Scotty, could some kind of general energy dampening field do that, and would the same type of thing account for the heavy subspace interference?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What does it look like?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"What is it, an alien ship?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Or is it alive, or is it"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Matt, your log stated that the fourth planet was breaking up."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,You went in to investigate.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Did you run a scanner check on it?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What kind of a beam?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,(answers communicator) Kirk here.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What about the Constellation's tapes?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,A robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Why?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What is the projected course of this thing?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Thank you.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Stand by, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,We don't know.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"An alien race, apparently from another galaxy."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Bones, did you ever hear of a doomsday machine?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,It's a weapon built primarily as a bluff.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,It's never meant to be used.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"So strong, it could destroy both sides in a war."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Something like the old H-Bomb was supposed to be.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,That's what I think this is.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,A doomsday machine that somebody used in a war uncounted years ago.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"They don't exist anymore, but the machine is still destroying."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Take it easy.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,There's no ship to leave.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,It's a dead hulk!
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,We'll take her in tow.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,I'll stay onboard and get her ready.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,You go back to the Enterprise with the doctor and let him help you.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Have the transporter room beam Doctor McCoy and Commodore Decker on board immediately.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,We're blind here.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What's it look like?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Whatever it is, we can't let it go beyond us to the next solar system."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,We have to stop it.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"If it's a robot, what are the chances of deactivating it?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,All right.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Lower your deflector screens Long enough to beam us aboard.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Spock?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Spock?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Come in, Spock."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Spock?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"We're stuck, blind, and deaf."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Well, we just can't stand around while our ship is being attacked."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Scotty, you've got to get me some manoeuvering power."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Then get me impulse power.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Half-speed, quarter-speed, anything."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"If we get this hulk moving, maybe we can do something."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Then get moving.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Washburn, you get in there."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Let's see what we can do about this viewing screen.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,I've got to find out what's happening out there.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What about the warp drive control circuits?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"You worry about your miracles, Scotty, I'll worry about mine."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Get to work.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Washburn, try the 2G6 circuit."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Ready to give it a try?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Scotty, how you doing?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Yes, I think (an image of tiny Enterprise and the giant planet killer comes on screen) What the devil's going on?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Come in.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, come in."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Scotty, where's that power?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Washburn, get down to Engineering."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Assist Mister Scott.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Scotty, push it right to the edge."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,This ship has got to manoeuver.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Scotty, give me that power."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,That'll do.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Full ahead, Mister Scott."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"That's it, Mister Scott."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Keep that power coming.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Keep pouring it on, Scotty."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"We're moving, the Enterprise isn't."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Maybe that thing will see us and let the Enterprise go.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,If I only had some phasers.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Scotty, you've just earned your pay for the week."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Stand by.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Fire phasers.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Scott, it worked."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Great.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,(sees that maw turning towards them) I think it's great.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Scotty, get us out of here."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Enterprise.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Matt.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What's going on?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Give me Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What happened to Spock?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Give me Spock.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"There's only one thing I want to say to you, Commodore."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Get my ship out of there.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, ship status."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,How long to repair warp drive?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Take evasive action, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Not with my ship, you don't."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, relieve Commodore Decker immediately."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,That's a direct order.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Blast regulations!
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, I order you to assume command on my personal authority as Captain of the Enterprise."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Good.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Now, Mister Spock"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Fine.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Just make sure you stay ahead of it.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Yes, Scotty."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Keep it going, Scotty, keep it going."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,I'm plotting an intercept course.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Will rendezvous with you at fourteen thirteen point seven hours.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Why are you launching a shuttlecraft?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,This is Kirk.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Matt, you'll be killed."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,No one expects you to die for an error in judgment.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Matt.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Matt, listen to me."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,You can't throw your life away like this.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Matt, you're a starship commander."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,That makes you a valuable commodity.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"We need you, your experience, your judgment."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Matt!
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,(Decker turns off the intercom)
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,We're stronger with you than without you!
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,It's regrettable that he died for nothing.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"What about that, Spock?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Is it possible?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Negative.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Scott and I will stay here, but beam the damage control party aboard."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Except possibly the destruction of that thing out there.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Carry out your orders, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Spock, listen."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Maybe Matt Decker didn't die for nothing.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,He had the right idea but not enough power to do it.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Am I correct in assuming that a fusion explosion of ninety seven megatons will result if a starship impulse engine is overloaded?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Ninety seven point eight three five.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Will it be powerful enough to destroy that thing out there?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Not through it, Spock, from inside it."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Will it be enough?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Do the best you can and make it fast.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk to Scott.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Good.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Scotty, can you set the ship's impulse engines to overload?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Set it and get up here as fast as you can.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Spock, you don't know?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,I intend to get a lot closer.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,I'm going to ram her right down that thing's throat.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,No.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"No, I don't intend to die, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,We've rigged a delay detonation device.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,You'll have thirty seconds to beam me aboard the Enterprise before the Constellation's impulse engines blow.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"A calculated risk, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,A chance I'll have to take.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,What about the detonator?
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Understood.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Prepare to beam Scotty on board.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Thank you.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,I can't.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Power level's dropping too fast.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,You'd better hurry.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Prepare to beam me aboard on my signal.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Beam me aboard.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Gentlemen, beam me aboard."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Gentlemen, I suggest you beam me aboard."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Sulu, ease us back to minimum headway."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Conserve power as much as possible.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Lieutenant Palmer, tell Mister Scott to expedite repairs on the warp drive."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Poor Matt.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,He gave his life in an attempt to save others.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Not the worst way to go.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Indeed it shall, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Ironic, isn't it?"
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Way back in the 20th century, the H-Bomb was the ultimate weapon, their doomsday machine, and we used something like it to destroy another doomsday machine."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,Probably the first time such a weapon has ever been used for constructive purposes.
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,"Well, I certainly hope not."
KIRK,The Doomsday Machine,I found one quite sufficient.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Sir, we're now within the limits of System L-370, but I can't seem to locate"
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Entering limits of System L-374, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,Scanners show the same evidence of destruction.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"All phaser banks manned and ready, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"No other vessels in the area, Captain."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,All scanners show clear.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"It's closing on us, Mister Spock."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"It's veering off, back on course for the next solar system."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"The Rigel colony, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,Closing fast.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,Direct hit.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,It just bounced off.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,We can't break loose!
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,We haven't got it.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,We're being pulled inside.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,We still can't move.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"We're loose, Commodore."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Standing by, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"We're moving away, Commodore."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"It's closing with us again, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,It's sucking in space rubble from those destroyed planets.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,Refueling itself.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"It's gaining on us, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Mark twenty one, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, someone's opening the shuttlecraft bay doors."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"It's too late, sir."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, sensors indicate a minute drop in the machine's power emanations."
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,Do you think the shuttlecraft explosion might have done some damage?
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,He's two thousand miles from the planet killer and closing fast.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,Fifteen hundred miles and closing.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,One thousand miles and closing.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,Five hundred miles and closing.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Sixty, fifty, forty"
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,Thirty.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,Ten
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Nine, eight"
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,Seven.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,Six.
SULU,The Doomsday Machine,"Five, four"
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain, sensors show this entire solar system has been destroyed."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Nothing left but rubble and asteroids.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Nonetheless, Captain, sensors show nothing but debris where we charted seven planets last year."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain, the two inner most planets of this system appear to be intact."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"I have it on the sensors, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"By configuration, a starship stopped in space."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,She appears to be drifting.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Sensors not recording normal energy output.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,She may have been wrecked by whatever destroyed these solar systems.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"All power plants dead, reserve energy banks operative at a very low power level."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Also operative at a low power level.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,The entire Bridge is damaged and uninhabitable.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,The rest of the ship seems able to sustain life.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Normal, but subspace interference makes readings difficult."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Enterprise, Spock here."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Improbable, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,The surface temperature of the inner planet is that of molten lead.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,The other has an atmosphere poisonous to human life.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Unable to raise Starfleet Command due to heavy subspace interference.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Attempting to remedy.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"She was attacked by what appears to be essentially a robot, an automated weapon of immense size and power."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Its apparent function is to smash planets to rubble and then digest the debris for fuel.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"It is, therefore, self-sustaining as long as there are planetary bodies for it to feed on."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Unknown, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"However, Mister Sulu has computed the path of the machine, using the destroyed solar systems as a base course."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Projecting back on our star charts, we find that it came from outside, from another galaxy."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"If it follows its present path, it will go through the most densely populated section of our galaxy."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Red alert!
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Red alert!
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"It came up on us fast, Captain, but we seem able to maintain our distance."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,It looks very much like Commodore Decker's planet killer.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,And it is pursuing us.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,(The viewscreen now shows it head-on.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,A round opening with a small sun partway down the gullet.)
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"We are more manoeuvrable, but it is gaining on us."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Sensors indicate some kind of total conversion drive.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"No evidence of life, subspace interference level incredibly high."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"I would say none, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,The energy generated by our power nacelles seems to attracts it.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,I doubt we could manoeuvre close enough without drawing a direct attack upon ourselves.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,I also believe the nature of this machine precludes the possibility of easy access to its control mechanisms.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Closing, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Transporter Room, stand by to beam landing party aboard."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Evasive action, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Damage report, all stations."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Affect repairs.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain Kirk, come in please."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain, we've been attacked."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,The transporter is damaged.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,We're taking evasive action.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Damage in communications, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Interference will (static)
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"We have outrun it, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Impulse and warp engines operative, transporter and communications under repair."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Random chance seems to have operated in our favour.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"I believe I said that, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Evidently programmed to ignore anything as small as a ship beyond a certain radius.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,We'll maintain a discreet distance and circle back to pick up the Captain.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"I am aware of the Rigel system's population, Commodore, but we are only one ship."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Our deflector shields are strained, our subspace transmitter is useless."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Logically, our primary duty is to survive in order to warn Starfleet Command."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Sulu, you will lay in an evasive course back to the Constellation."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"You will carry out my last order, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"You have the right to do so, but I would advise against it."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"You tried to destroy it once before, Commodore."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,The result was a wrecked ship and a dead crew.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Sensors show the object's hull is solid neutronium.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,A single ship cannot combat it.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Unfortunately, Starfleet Order 104, Section B, leaves me no alternative."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Paragraph 1A clearly states
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"If you can certify Commodore Decker medically or psychologically unfit for command, I can relieve him under Section C."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,You'll also be asked to produce your medical records to prove it.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Then your statement would not be considered valid.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Deflector shields at full power.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,They can't take much more of this.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Deflectors holding, but weakening."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"We must retreat, Commodore."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,The energy drain
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Commodore, I urgently recommend immediate withdrawal."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,It has ceased fire.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,We're being held in a tractor beam.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"We're being pulled inside, Commodore."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,You must veer off.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,We have lost warp power.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"If we don't break the tractor beam within sixty seconds, we never will."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"That, sir, is illogical."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,It is suicide.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Attempted suicide would be proof that you are psychologically unfit for command.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"If you don't veer off, I shall relieve you on that basis."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Emergency impulse power.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,It's closing fast on the Constellation.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Commodore, I suggest"
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,This machine seems to have a programmed defensive sphere.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Any energy source entering that field is subject to attack.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Warp drive and deflectors will be out for a solar day.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Repairs proceeding on transporter and communications.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"We can maintain this speed for only seven hours before we exhaust our fuel, but it can refuel itself indefinitely."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Illogical.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,We cannot destroy it.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Therefore, we cannot save Rigel."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,We must transport the Captain and the others from the Constellation and escape this thing's subspace interference in order to warn Starfleet Command.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Can you raise Starfleet?
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"On audio, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Commodore.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Warp drive out.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Deflector shields down.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Transporter under repair.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,We are on emergency impulse power.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,At least one solar day.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"At our present rate of consumption, we'll exhaust our impulse power long before then."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Commodore Decker, you are relieved of command."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"You may file a formal protest with Starfleet Command, assuming we survive to reach a Starbase."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,But you are relieved.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Commodore.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,I do not wish to place you under arrest.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Vulcans never bluff.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain, I have assumed command."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"One moment, sir."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Commodore.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,I believe you are scheduled for medical examination.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Mister Montgomery.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,You will accompany the commodore to Sickbay.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Sulu, change course."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Seven zero mark two one.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain, we are taking an evasive course back to you."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,We will try to stay ahead of the object until we can transport you aboard.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Shut them, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Whoever it is, Captain, has no authorisation."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Lieutenant, raise the shuttlecraft."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Commodore, I must insist that you return to the ship."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"You cannot succeed, Commodore."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Your only logical alternative is to return to the ship.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,He's gone.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Constellation, come in, please."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain Kirk, come in please."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Sir, may I offer my condolences on the death of your friend."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,It is most regrettable.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"The drop in power is definite, Captain but negligible."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"The object is still pursing us, thereby causing us to drain our power reserve at a much greater rate."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Transporter operational, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Shall we beam you aboard?
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,There's little to be gained by staying aboard the Constellation.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Transporter Room.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Beam damage control party aboard.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"No, sir."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Ninety seven point eight three five megatons.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Its hull is pure neutronium.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,There is no known way of blasting through it.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Insufficient data.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,I shall try to take further sensor readings.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Captain?
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,The object's neutronium hull makes sensor readings of the inner mechanism impossible.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Correct.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain, you're getting dangerously close to the planet killer."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Jim, you'll be killed, just like Decker."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Your chances of survival are not promising.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,We don't even know if the explosion will be powerful enough.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"There's another factor, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,The transporter is not working at one hundred percent efficiency.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Thirty seconds is very slim timing.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Transporter, stand by."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Transporter is out, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,You'll have to stand by.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Scott, speed is of the essence."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain, transporter operational, but just barely."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Transporter, stand by."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Energise.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"We can't, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Transporter is out again.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Scott, twenty seconds to detonation."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Mister Scott?
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Mister Scott
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Try inverse phasing.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Mister Scott?
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Energy output zero.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Radiation level normal.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Welcome aboard, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,Sensors show all energy sources deactivated.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,It's quite dead.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Indeed, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,I presume your log will show that Commodore Decker died in the line of duty.
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"Appropriate, Captain."
SPOCK,The Doomsday Machine,"However, I can't help wondering if there are any more of those weapons wandering around the universe."
WASHBURN,The Doomsday Machine,Radiation level normal.
WASHBURN,The Doomsday Machine,Atmospheric pressure eleven pounds per square inch.
WASHBURN,The Doomsday Machine,What a mess.
WASHBURN,The Doomsday Machine,"What do you think did it, sir?"
WASHBURN,The Doomsday Machine,"We made a complete check on structural and control damage, sir."
WASHBURN,The Doomsday Machine,"As far as we can tell, something crashed through the deflectors and knocked out the generators."
WASHBURN,The Doomsday Machine,Somehow the antimatter in the warp drive pods has been deactivated.
WASHBURN,The Doomsday Machine,"Just one minute, sir."
WASHBURN,The Doomsday Machine,"Try it now, Captain."
WASHBURN,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, sir."
WASHBURN,The Doomsday Machine,(leaves)
CREWMAN,The Doomsday Machine,"Filtration systems are out, sir."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"The whole communication system looks to be shorted out, too, sir."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Come along, lads."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"I don't know, lad."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"But I want a full structural and control damage check, and I'm going to have a look at those engines."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain, I've checked the engines."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,The warp drive is a hopeless pile of junk.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,The impulse engines are not too badly off.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,We ought to be able to do something with them.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,Exhausted.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,They didn't give up without a battle.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,Computer system is still intact.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,We can playback the duplicate Captain's Log from the auxiliary control room.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Ready with the duplicate log, sir."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain, Washburn has our report."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, that all adds up."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,But what sort of a thing could do all that?
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,And paralysed.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,No power.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,I can't repair warp drive without a spacedock.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, the impulse engines are still in fair shape."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,I might coax them.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Come on, lad."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain, the impulse engines' control circuits are fused solid."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, we can cross-connect the controls, but it'll make the ship almost impossible for one man to handle."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Controls are all hooked up, sir."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,We should have some power for you soon.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Coming, sir."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"If I push these impulse engines too hard in the condition they're in, they'll blow apart."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"You've got it, Captain."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,Just enough to move us.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,I can't do better.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain, I still don't know what we're doing."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,Phasers?
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,You've got 'em.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,I have one bank recharged.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,I've hooked in ship's communication.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,The best I can give you on impulse is one third power.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,The shields are up but they won't last long.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Here, sir."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,The damage control party just beamed back to the Enterprise.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,Aye.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"The shape the thing's in, it's hard to keep her from blowing."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,Right away.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"A cranky transporter's a mighty finicky piece of machinery to be gambling your life on, sir."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,I've linked it in with the impulse control system.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,(flips a switch) It's armed now.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,Press this one.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Thirty seconds later, poof!"
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Once it's activated, there's no way to stop it."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Good luck, Captain."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,What's the matter with that thing?
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,It'll never work like this.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,It's the main junction circuitry.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,I'll get it.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Bridge, transporter operational, but this jury-rigging won't last for long."
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,He's got to come off now.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,I'll stand by here.
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Och, what's wrong with it?"
SCOTT,The Doomsday Machine,"Try her now, Mister Kyle."
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,Commodore?
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,Commodore Decker?
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,(he injects him)
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,"Jim, give him a minute."
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,He's in a state of shock.
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,This whole thing's incredible.
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,A robot?
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,"A machine like that, who would build it?"
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,But why?
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,No.
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,"I'm a doctor, not a mechanic."
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,The first thing we're going to do is get you back to the Enterprise.
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,Come on.
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,"No casualties, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,How are we doing?
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,"In plain, non-Vulcan English, we've been lucky."
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,"You can't let him do this, Spock."
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,"So are you, sir."
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,"Well, Spock?"
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,To blazes with regulations!
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,You can't let him take command when you know he's wrong!
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,I'll certify that right now.
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,"Now, you know I haven't had time to run an examination on him."
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,What about the Captain?
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,We can't leave
MCCOY,The Doomsday Machine,"Spock, do something!"
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,It's Jim Kirk.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,A ship.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Attacked.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"That, that thing."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,That
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Captain's log, stardate 4202.1."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Exceptionally heavy subspace interference still prevents our contacting Starfleet to inform them of the destroyed solar systems we have encountered.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,We are now entering system L-374.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Science Officer Masada reports the fourth planet seems to be breaking up.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,We are going to investigate.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,We tried to contact Starfleet.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,No one heard.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,No one!
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,We couldn't run.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Oh, I had to beam them down."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,We were dead.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"No power, our phasers useless."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"I stayed behind, the last man."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"The Captain, the last man aboard the ship."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"That's what you're supposed to do, isn't it?"
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,And then it hit again and the transporter went out.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"They were down there, and I'm up here."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"They say there's no devil, Jim, but there is."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Right out of hell, I saw it."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,On the third planet.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Don't you think I know that?
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"There was, but not anymore."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,They called me.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"They begged me for help, four hundred of them."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,I couldn't.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,I couldn't.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,(breaks down in tears)
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"If you'd seen it, you'd know."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,The whole thing's a weapon.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,It must be.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Well, it's miles long, with a maw that could swallow a dozen starships."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"It destroys planets, chops them into rubble."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Both or neither.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,I don't know.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"We saw this thing hovering over the planet, slicing out chunks of it with a force beam."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Pure antiproton.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Absolutely pure.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Oh, forget about your theories!"
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,That thing is on the way to the heart of our galaxy.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,What are you going to do about it?
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Oh, no, I stay here."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,I'm not leaving my ship!
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"It's just that I, I, I never lost a command before."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Status report.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,You can't let that reach Rigel.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Why, millions of innocent people would die."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Our primary duty is to maintain life and safety of Federation planets.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Do you deny that?
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Belay that last order, helmsman."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"One hundred and eighty degree turn, hard about."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,We're going to attack.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, I'm officially notifying you that I'm exercising my option under regulations as a Starfleet Commodore, and that I am assuming command of the Enterprise."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,That thing must be destroyed.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,I made a mistake then.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,We were too far away.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,This time I'm going to hit it with full phasers at point-blank range.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, that will be all."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,You have been relieved of command.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Don't force me to relieve you of duty as well.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Doctor, you are out of line."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"You may leave the Bridge, Doctor."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Doctor, you may leave the Bridge."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock knows his duty under regulations, Doctor."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Do you?
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"(McCoy leaves) Hard about, helmsman."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Course thirty two degrees, mark ten."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Deflectors at full power.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Ready on main phaser banks.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Helmsman, hold your course."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Stand by all phaser banks.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"I'm in command here, Mister Spock."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Maintain your course, helmsman."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Get us in closer.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Fire!
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Recommendation noted.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Maintain course.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Fire!
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Maintain phaser fire, helmsman."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,But don't you understand?
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,We've got to destroy it!
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Veer off.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Full power astern.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Good boy, Jim."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Between the two of us, we'll kill that thing."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Kirk pulled us out of there by distracting it.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Now it's our turn.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Fire phasers.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,(they do) We did it!
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Hard about.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Give me some distance.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, status report."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Maintain speed and distance.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Then we'll have to fight it now before it gets any stronger.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, I am still in command."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,I will speak for this ship.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Enterprise to Kirk.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Commodore Decker speaking.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"I'm in command here, Jim."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Nothing.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,I assumed command according to regulations
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Since your first officer was reluctant to take aggressive action against the
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"You are speaking to a senior officer, Kirk."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"I told you, I am in command here, according to every rule in the book, Captain."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Anything you have to say at all, you will say to me."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Down here.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,(the arm of the Captain's chair)
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"I told you, I am in command here and I will give the orders, Captain."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,We're going to turn and attack.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,You can't relieve me and you know it.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,According to regulations
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,I don't recognise your authority to relieve me.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,You wouldn't dare.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,(Spock signals the guards forward) You're bluffing.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,No.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"No, I don't suppose that they do."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Very well, Mister Spock."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,The Bridge is yours.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Shuttlecraft to Enterprise.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,Decker here.
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"You said it yourself, Spock."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"There is no way to blast through the hull of that machine, so I'm going to take this thing right down its throat."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"I've been prepared for death ever since I, ever since I killed my crew."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"The commander is responsible for the lives of his crew, and for their deaths."
DECKER,The Doomsday Machine,"Well, I should have died with mine."
KYLE,The Doomsday Machine,"Ready to beam, sir."
KYLE,The Doomsday Machine,"Mister Spock, the transporter's out."
KYLE,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, aye, sir."
KYLE,The Doomsday Machine,"It's a power drain somewhere, sir."
KYLE,The Doomsday Machine,I almost lost you.
KYLE,The Doomsday Machine,Bridge.
KYLE,The Doomsday Machine,Transporter malfunction.
KYLE,The Doomsday Machine,"Standing by, sir."
KYLE,The Doomsday Machine,Energising.
KYLE,The Doomsday Machine,"Bridge, it's shorted out again."
KYLE,The Doomsday Machine,"Bridge, we got him through!"
MONTGOMERY,The Doomsday Machine,Sir.
MONTGOMERY,The Doomsday Machine,"Aye, sir."
MONTGOMERY,The Doomsday Machine,Commodore?
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"Captain, I think I'm going to like Argelius."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"You mean to tell me all these women, that all this is"
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Aye.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Why shouldn't I?
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Now that's what I call a real Captain.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Always thinking of his men.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"Now no one has to tell an old Aberdeen pub-crawler how to applaud, Captain."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"'Tis a fine foggy night tonight, and I doubt if anyone's ever told you of the marvellous fogs we have in Aberdeen."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"Well then, why don't I show you?"
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,There's nothing like a walk in the fog with a bonny lass.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"You don't mind, do you?"
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I might even get back to the ship on time.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"I, I don't remember."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,We were walking in the fog.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I was up ahead trying to lead the way.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I heard the girl scream.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I remember starting to turn.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I don't remember another thing.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"I certainly hope so, sir."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I can't stand this not knowing.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,(leaves)
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Lieutenant?
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Captain?
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Where's
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Dead?
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,But I
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I was sitting there.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"She was taking her readings, and now I'm sitting here."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"I tell you, I don't remember."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I must have passed out.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"Captain, I've been trying."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I can't even believe this is really happening.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"Captain, you mean my neck is going to have to depend on some spooky mumbo jumbo?"
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"No, Captain."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"Sir, I swear to you I did not kill your wife or the other ladies."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Aye.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Aye.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I understand.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"I'm not lying, Captain."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I don't remember a thing about the first two murders.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Captain?
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I didn't black out when Mister Jaris' wife was killed.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,We were holding hands.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"When the lights went out, the circle was broken."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"I heard the poor lady scream, and as I was near the head of the table anyway I went toward her."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,But there was something in my way.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"No, Captain, some thing."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"Cold, it was, like a stinking draught out of a slaughterhouse, but it wasn't really there."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Like it.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,(lost for words) If you know what I mean.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"No, Captain."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,That I'm sure of.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Twenty two sir.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"Morla on the one side and you on the other, sir."
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I don't remember.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,I don't remember.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Captain!
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"Well, sir?"
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,"What did you do with that thing, Captain?"
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Did you send it back to the planet?
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Why not?
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,For a while there I didn't know whether I was innocent or guilty.
SCOTT,Wolf In The Fold,Let's go see!
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Obviously a man of good taste.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Yes, yes, yes."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,The Argelians think very highly of their pleasure.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Do you like her, Scotty?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Good.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,I've invited her to join us at the table.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,I thought you might like to meet her.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Scotty, Scotty."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,In Argelius they use the lights.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Have one of our pillows?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"We won't leave without you, Scotty."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Relax and enjoy yourself.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,(Scott and Kara leave) My work is never done.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Physically he's all right.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Am I right in assuming that?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,He seems he's overcoming his resentment.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Mission accomplished as far as Scotty is concerned.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Bones, I know a little place across town where the women"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Stabbed, a dozen times."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"We're just as shocked as you are, Mister Hengist."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Scotty, you left the cafe with the girl."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Do you remember that?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,What happened next?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Scotty, you've got to remember."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,I know a murder's been committed.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,It doesn't make any difference what I think.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Bones, I have a diplomatic responsibility."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,This happened under Argelian jurisdiction.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"If they want to arrest him, try him, even convict him, I have to go along with it."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,We'll do what we can.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Yes.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Mister Hengist, there were other people in the cafe about the time of the murder."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Several of them left just before Mister Scott and the girl did.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,What's the law in these cases?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Yes, we've heard of it."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,I assumed it was a lost art.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Depending on your wife's empathic abilities is all very well, Prefect, but there's only one way we can find out what it is Mister Scott cannot remember."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Since you find it impossible to let us go back up to our ship, I can beam down a technician with a psycho-tricorder."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Mister Spock, beam down a technician with a psycho-tricorder, please."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Use these co-ordinates.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Kirk out.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Well, that would be most unfortunate."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Argelian hospitality is well-known, as well as its strategic importance as a space port."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Lieutenant, I want a twenty four hour regressive memory check made on Mister Scott."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Scotty, co-operate completely with Lieutenant Tracy."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Maybe we'll clear this thing up.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,But that blow on the head.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,It could put all his previous behaviour patterns into the junk heap.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Explain.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,The knife?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,No.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Scotty.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Stabbed over and over again.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Lieutenant Tracy is dead, Scott."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,You were found alone in the room.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,What happened down there?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,That head injury.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Think, Scotty."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,There's no way into that place from up here.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Prefect, is there another entrance to that chamber?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Check it.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Where've they been during the past few minutes?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"There's been another murder, Hengist."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,One of my crew.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Stabbed.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,And there's no sign of the weapon.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,You.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,You were a musician at the cafe.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,You played for the murdered girl.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,And you.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,You left the cafe before Scott and Kara.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Did you know Kara?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Jealousy has often been a motive for murder.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Can you prove you went directly home?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Well get on with it, man."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Just don't stand there.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Well of course I'm trying to save my friend, if he's innocent."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,And he hasn't been proven guilty.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"On one condition, Prefect."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,That the room be sealed so that no one can leave or enter while the ceremony is going on.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Kirk here.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Yes.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"(moves away from the group) Yes, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"What do you suggest, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,These are a proud people.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"They have their own customs, their own laws, and while we're here we're subject to them."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,It is absolutely imperative that this matter be resolved according to Argelian law.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Is that clear?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"I don't like it any more than you do, Spock, but there's nothing we can do about it."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Kirk out,"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Three murders, and Scotty the only possible answer each time."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Normally, no, but that blow on his head could"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,But not responsible.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"We can prove it, if he's insane."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"That's what we hope to find out, sir."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Mister Hengist.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"On the Enterprise, we can make a recording of the registrations of Mister Scott's conscious and subconscious mind."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,They will tell us what happened to him in the recent past.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,No doubt will remain.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Each testifier will sit here, place his hand on this plate."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Any deviation from factual truth will be immediately detected and relayed to this computer which will in turn notify us.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Doctor McCoy has already fed the computer his medical reports.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Our laboratory experts are examining the murder weapon and will give their data to the computers for analysis.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Shall we begin?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Mister Scott, will you take the stand?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Computer, identify verification."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Subject's present physical condition.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Sufficient abnormalities to account for periods of functional amnesia?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Unless Scotty's lying about his loss of memory.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Computer, accuracy scan."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"All right, Scotty, let's have it."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Something?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,You mean someone.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Computer.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,All right.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Let's hit it on the head.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Scotty, did you kill Sybo?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Scotty, lie to me."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,How old are you?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"After the lights went out, Mister Scott, who was holding your hand?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,The verifier showed that he was telling the truth when he said he didn't kill her.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Mister Scott.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Did you kill Kara?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Computer, accuracy scan."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"After we take the testimony here, we'll run a psycho-tricorder analysis of Mister Scott's memory, which is what we wanted to do on the surface."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,That will give us a complete record.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Will that satisfy you, Mister Hengist?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,There will be no error.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"As for the rest of it, the readings will show."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"You can step down, Mister Scott, if there are no objections."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,We can ask no more.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Mister Morla, will you take the stand?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Where were you at the time that Kara was murdered?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Did you kill Sybo?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Computer, verification scan."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"All right, Mister Morla, I think you can step down now."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Sybo spoke of a hunger that never dies.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Something that thrives on fear, terror, death."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Mister Spock, maybe we're going about it in the wrong way."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Let's assume that Sybo was a sensitive.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"That she did sense something, something evil."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"All right, then, what was it she said, exactly?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"A monstrous evil, ancient terror."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"She said something else, words that didn't make sense."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Obscure, meaningless words."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Ah.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Mister Spock, check them out."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Jack the Ripper?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Yes, all men die."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,And Jack the Ripper couldn't be alive if he were a man.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"But everything we've uncovered points to Jack the Ripper, which is an impossibility, isn't it?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Or is it?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,We know that someone or something killed three women.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"If it's impossible for it to be human, it has to be something else."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Something driven to kill.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"No, Mister Hengist, not ghosts."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Possibly not human, but not ghosts."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Mister Spock, check out the possibilities."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Computer, could the described entity assume physical form?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"No, I've seen the mellitus myself."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"In its natural state, it's gaseous."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"When it's at rest, it's solid."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Mister Spock, let's assume the existence of this creature."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Doesn't seem likely, does it?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"All right, Mister Spock, what do we have?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"A creature without form, that feeds on horror and fear, that must assume a physical shape to kill."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Computer.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Criminological files.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Cases of unsolved mass murders of women since Jack the Ripper.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Yes.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"When man moved out into the galaxy, that thing must've moved with him."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Computer, identify the proper names Kesla and Beratis."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,You come from Rigel Four.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"No, but what we're investigating is."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Would you mind taking the stand, Mister Hengist?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,And you were unaccounted for when Lieutenant Tracy was murdered.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Perhaps.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Mister Spock.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,The murder weapon.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Now then, Mister Hengist"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,But that's impossible.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,And the computer controls the ship.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Audio cut off, Spock."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"It means that thing can control the entire operation of the ship, including the life support systems."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"All hands, this is the captain."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Stay at your posts.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Remain calm.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Captain out.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Bones.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,What's the sedative situation?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Good.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Start distribution immediately.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"The longer we can hold back that fear, the more time we'll have to get that thing out of the computer."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Prefect, you'll all be safer here."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Spock, come with me."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Spock, don't you have a compulsory scan unit built into the computer banks?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Aren't there certain mathematical problems which simply cannot be solved?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,That ought to do it.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Spock!
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Too quickly.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Bridge.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Out of control.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Put it on manual.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Bridge.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,That was due to be next.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Life-support malfunction.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"You said it yourself, Spock."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"It wants terror, not just death."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,All right.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Man your station, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Cut that thing off.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Try and cut that thing off.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Man your post, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,(to all the crew) Prepare your manual overrides.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,You may need them.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Spock.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,That should be enough time.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Let's get at it.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Never mind, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Tranquilliser?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Everyone, including yourself."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Spock?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Yes, I know."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"If you destroy this ship, you destroy yourself."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Man your post, Mister."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"If any of the other systems go out, switch to manual override, and above all, don't be afraid."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Implement.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Yes, that should keep that thing busy for a while."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,The Argelians will be the first to panic.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Let's get back to the briefing room.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,I doubt very much whether the computers will be inhabited by more than a group of figures for a while.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,How are you doing?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Yes, but where to?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Bones, what would happen if that thing entered a tranquillised body?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,You say everyone's had a shot but you and Jaris?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Well, I'm willing to take a chance on Mister Spock."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Better give yourself a shot, Doc."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Do as I say.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Extend your arm, Mister Jaris."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Let's get him to the Transporter Room, quick!"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Deep space.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Full power.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Widest angle of dispersion.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Maintain.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"You do it, Spock."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,No.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"We beamed it out into open space, Scotty."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Widest possible dispersion.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,But it will die finally.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,You seem very happy about the whole thing.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Bones, how long will it take for this tranquilliser to wear off?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Yes, I can see that."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Well Mister Spock, for the next five or six hours, we're going to have the happiest crew in space."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Of course, we won't get much work done."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"That's a splendid idea, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,I know a cafe where the women are so
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"You, gentlemen?"
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,In your condition?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Don't be ridiculous.
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"Mister Spock, this cafe has women that are so."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,"(met with a Look) No, I guess not."
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Alone?
KIRK,Wolf In The Fold,Gentlemen.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,That's an understatement if I ever heard one.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,This is a completely hedonistic society.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"My work, Jim."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,This is prescription stuff.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Don't forget, the explosion that threw Scotty against a bulkhead was caused by a woman."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Oh, yes, yes."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"As a matter of fact, considerable psychological damage could have been caused."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"For example, his total resentment toward women."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Of course, in my professional opinion, when he gets back to the ship, he's going to hate you for making him leave Argelius."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,But then he will have lost total resentment toward women.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,Oh yes.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,I know the place.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,Let's go.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"She's dead, Jim."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"You're not a native of Argelius, sir?"
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,Jim.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"(they move off a little way) If he says he can't remember, he probably doesn't."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,You know Scotty.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,You don't think by any chance that Scotty
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,But you don't just throw him to the wolves.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,But he's suffering from a severe concussion.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,The Argelian empathic contact?
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Prefect, it will give us a detailed account of everything that's happened to Mister Scott in the last twenty four hours."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Prefect, the psycho-tricorder will require privacy to be effective."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Captain, under normal conditions, Scotty would have never done such a thing."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Of course, there's another possibility."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,Hysterical amnesia.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"When a man feels guilty about something, something too terrible to remember, he blots it out of his conscious memory."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"She's dead, Jim."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,Just like the other one.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Go ahead, Scotty."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,Is that all that happened?
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"It could be, Jim."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,That head injury.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Locks can be picked, Jim."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Sorry, Jim."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,The lock may or may not have been picked.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,It would be hard to tell even with the tricorder.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"I don't care what the circumstances indicate, Jim."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,Scotty simply could not have done it.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,There would be no room for doubt.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,We would know.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"And after all, that's what we're after, isn't it, Prefect?"
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,To know?
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Captain, I don't see how that can be."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,That devours all life and light.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,Yes.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Redjac, Beratis and, er, Kesla."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,Sybo said it feeds on death.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Yes, but she said more than that."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Not just death, but fear."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,She said it also feeds on fear.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,Extremely possible There are many such examples that exist in nature.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Just after you left Jaris' house, we discovered the murder knife was missing."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"He's dead, Jim."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Scotty, give me a hand."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"(They prop Hengist up on a chair, leaning against the table.)"
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,I've got some stuff that would tranquillise an active volcano.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"If you drive it out of the computers, it'll have to go somewhere else."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,I'm almost finished.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,Just Jaris and me.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Well, it might take up knitting, but nothing more violent than that."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"And you and Mister Spock, Captain."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"No, I don't think so."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,I think I ought to stay clear.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,You'd better be careful.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,You're going to hurt somebody with that thing.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"Well, Jaris is all right."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,That thing can't die.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,I don't know.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,Five or six hours.
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"I gave them a pretty big shot, Jim."
MCCOY,Wolf In The Fold,"I know the place, Jim."
KARA,Wolf In The Fold,"Never a word, but I'm dying to learn."
KARA,Wolf In The Fold,Or a handsome gentleman.
KARA,Wolf In The Fold,Why don't we?
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"(a neat man in a suit) I don't know what to say, gentlemen."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,Argelius is the last planet in the galaxy I'd expect a thing like this to happen.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"If this was my home planet, Rigel Four, I'd have a dozen investigators working on the matter, but they don't exist here."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Oh, no."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,Argelius hires its administrative officers from other planets.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"The Argelians aren't very efficient, you know."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Gentle, harmless people."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,Mister Scott.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,Mister Scott?
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Now, are you sure you've never seen this before?"
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,(the knife)
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Really, sir."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,That is hardly helpful.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"It's not promising, Captain."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Mister Scott insists he remembers nothing, but my detector readings indicates that only his fingerprints are on the murder weapon."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,So I've been informed by the staff.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,They're being located and we will question them.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,But the outlook for your friend is quite grim.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Gentlemen, our prefect, Jaris."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Sir, Captain Kirk, Doctor McCoy."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"And this man is Scott, the one I sent you the message about."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Prefect, don't you think this should be handled in an official manner through my office?"
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Oh, I'd advise against it, Prefect."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,This is purely an Argelian matter.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,There are other people we should question.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,Perhaps I should go expedite their arrival here?
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Prefect, both of these men were at the cafe the night of the murder."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Captain, if you don't mind please."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Why, that's terrible."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"(to the man from the next table) You, my men picked you up near there."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,What were you doing?
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Well, how was the girl killed?"
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,If only I had facilities.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Captain, may I continue with the questions please?"
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Need I remind you of the circumstances, Captain?"
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"In both cases, your friend Scott was discovered over the body and later claimed to remember nothing."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"I agree with you, Captain."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,I'm perfectly satisfied Mister Scott is guilty.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"That is unproven, sir."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"By your own admission, you don't know whether you did or didn't."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,Your so-called failing memory
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,He's been saying that right along.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,It means no more now than it did before.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"But I remind you we found Mister Scott holding her in his arms, the knife still (to Jaris) I'm sorry, sir, but I must."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,The knife still in her back and blood on his hands.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,There were two other women murdered.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,This is a waste of time.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Well, if you can convince me that the machine is incapable of error, and if it shows he did not kill the women."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,I object to the entire procedure.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Prefect, I know you mean well, but I've had experience"
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,That's ridiculous.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,He lived hundreds of years ago.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Surely, Prefect, this has gone far enough."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Someone, some man has killed three women."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,We have the prime suspect in our hands.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,Are we going to let him go and start chasing ghosts?
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,Fairy tales.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,Ghosts and goblins.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,This is fantasy!
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,We all know the murderer is sitting right here.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,You're trying to cloud the issue.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,I've got a mind to
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Well, many people do."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,It's not a crime.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,I will not.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Prefect, this has gone far enough."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,I will not take the stand.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Gentlemen, I know something of the law."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,You're engaging in sheer speculation.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,Everybody keep back or I'll kill her!
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,I'll kill her!
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,Keep back!
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,You'll suffer!
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,You'll suffer.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,(Spock injects him) I'll kill all of you.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"You'll die, die, die."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,Everybody will die.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,"Kill, kill, kill you all."
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,Everybody die.
HENGIST,Wolf In The Fold,You'll all suffer.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,The law of Argelius is love.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"And this is my wife, Sybo."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,He does not look like a man capable of such an act.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Still, it's been so long."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Gentlemen, before our great awakening two hundred years ago, we had ways of learning the truth in such matters."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,We shall return to them.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,You know of this?
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,My wife is a descendent of the ancient priestesses of our land.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,She has the ancestral gift.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Gentlemen, I have come to invite you to my home."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"It shall be handled in an official manner, Mister Hengist, since I am the highest official."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Gentlemen, let us proceed to my home where, with the aid of my wife, we shall learn the truth."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Please.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,My wife must meditate for a time before she's ready.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,I see no reason why we should not use that time to good advantage.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Very well, Captain."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,There is a small chamber below this room.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Perhaps that will suffice.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Captain, news of this frightful murder is spreading among my people."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,They're greatly disturbed.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,I have already heard talk of closing Argelius to space vehicles.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Yes.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,I believe it's the only one in the quadrant.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,(hands out drinks) Captain.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Yes, please do so, Mister Hengist."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Anyone with any connection with this murder should be present at the ceremony.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"If you'll Just follow me, Lieutenant."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Are you ready, Sybo?"
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Certainly.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Among other gifts, Sybo has the ability to receive impressions from inanimate objects."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Do you have it, Captain?"
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,But I put it here when we arrived.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,It's gone.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,(to Scott) Drink this.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"An Argelian stimulant, Doctor."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Quite effective and quite harmless.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Yes, there's a door that leads into the garden, but it's been locked for years."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,The same as Kara.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Is this true?
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Who are you?
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,That is very disquieting.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Yes, I know."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,That is why the emotion is so strongly disapproved of here.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"We shall see, Morla."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Captain, Captain."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,You're behaving very much like a man who is desperately trying anything to save his friend.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Would you be as desperate to save Argelius as a space port for your Starfleet?
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Gentlemen, sit down please."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,(he flicks a row of switches and the doorways are closed) The room is sealed.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Gentlemen, please."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,How could any man do such monstrous things?
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Mister Scott?
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"You, sir, claim to remember nothing about the murders."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"If this is so, you may have killed without knowing it."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Will your machines tell us this?
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Very well.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"We will go to your ship, and he who is guilty will face the ancient penalties, barbaric and horrible though they may be."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,The ancient penalty for murder was death by slow torture.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,That law has never been changed.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Do you understand that, Mister Scott?"
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,All that proves is that he's telling the truth when he says he doesn't remember.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Mister Hengist, we are here on my authority."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,We will co-operate.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"For the time being, we will accept Captain Kirk's explanation of the machine's accuracy as factual."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"I do, however, reserve to myself the right to make the final determination."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"My poor Sybo's talent was genuine, gentlemen."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,What she told you was true.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Just before she died, my wife said, it is a hunger that never dies."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Is that possible?
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,I am satisfied the course of this investigation is valid enough.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"Please be seated, Mister Hengist."
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Mister Hengist.
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,What does it mean?
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,"(grabs Kirk's throat) No, no, kill you all!"
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Die!
JARIS,Wolf In The Fold,Make you suffer!
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Enterprise.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Spock here.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Co-ordinates received.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,May I have a word with you?
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Concerning the situation you related to us.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"In my opinion, the Argelian empathic contact is an interesting phenomenon, but the technique is not sound enough to risk a man's life."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Simply that we beam Mister Scott on board the Enterprise and employ our computers to learn the truth.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Quite clear, Captain."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Anger is a relative state, sir."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Were you angry enough to do violence?
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Sensitivity of certain Argelian women is a documented fact, Captain."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"To us, perhaps, but to the computer?"
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Computer, linguistic bank."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Definition of following word.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Redjac.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,There is no such word in the linguistics bank?
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Scan all other banks.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Define.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Humans and humanoids make up only a small percentage of the life forms we know of.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"There are entities possessed of extremely long life spans, virtually immortal."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"In the strict scientific sense, Doctor, we all feed on death."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Even vegetarians.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Which would tend to support the proposition that the murderer was not human.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Deriving sustenance from emotion is not unknown in the galaxy, and fear is among the strongest and most violent of the emotions."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Computer, digest log recordings for past five solar minutes."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Correlate hypotheses.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Compare with life forms register.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Question.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Could such an entity within discussed limits exist in this galaxy?
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Computer, extrapolate most likely composition of such entity."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Working.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"To meet with specified requirements, entity would exist without form in conventional sense."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Most probable mass of energy of highly cohesive electromagnetic field.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,I point out that Jack the Ripper slew at will in the heart of the most populous city of old Earth and was never identified.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"I suggest the possibility of a hypnotic screen, which blinds all but the victim to the presence of the killer."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"And I suspect preys on women because women are more easily and more deeply terrified, generating more sheer horror than the male of the species."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Captain, those places are aligned directly between Argelius and Earth."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"I can appreciate your position, sir."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,You are in charge of civil disturbances locally.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"If you are the entity for which we search, what better position from which to kill with impunity?"
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"An entity which feeds on fear and terror would find a perfect hunting ground on Argelius, a planet without violence, where the inhabitants are as peaceful as sheep."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,The entity would be as a hungry wolf in that fold.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Computer.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Report on analysis of Exhibit A.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Specify.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Point of origin.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,The computer will not respond to these controls.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,The entity is unquestionably controlling it.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"It's no use, Captain."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,The bypass circuits are blocked.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Indeed, it will try, but not immediately."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,We know it feeds on fear and terror.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,There are nearly four hundred and forty humans aboard this ship.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Surely it will try to breed fear and terror before it kills.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Yes we do, Captain, but with the entity in control"
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Indeed.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,If we could focus the attention of the computer on one of them.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Apparently our friends learned very quickly.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Freefall!
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"We don't have much time, Captain."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Normal environmental levels have been restored, Captain, but it will not last long."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,A few hours at best.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Proceeding, Captain, but I will need some time."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"It is attempting to generate terror, Captain."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Ready.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Computer, this is a Class A compulsory directive."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Compute to the last digit the value of pi.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"As we know, the value of pi is a transcendental figure without resolution."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,The computer banks will work on this problem to the exclusion of all else until we order it to stop.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"There is resistance, Captain, but the directive is succeeding."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,Bank after bank is turning to the problem.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Complete computer control, Captain."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,The entity has fled.
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Possibly, Doctor."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Its consciousness may continue for some time, consisting of billions of separate bits of energy, floating forever in space, powerless."
SPOCK,Wolf In The Fold,"Captain, since you came to Argelius to rest, I suggest you take advantage of the opportunity."
KAREN,Wolf In The Fold,"Lieutenant Karen Tracy reporting as ordered, Captain."
KAREN,Wolf In The Fold,"Yes, Captain."
KAREN,Wolf In The Fold,Where shall I set up?
SYBO,Wolf In The Fold,I am ready.
SYBO,Wolf In The Fold,"May I have the knife, please?"
SYBO,Wolf In The Fold,"I am ready, Jaris."
SYBO,Wolf In The Fold,Let us begin.
SYBO,Wolf In The Fold,Let the circle not be broken.
SYBO,Wolf In The Fold,Concentrate upon the flame which burns upon the altar of truth.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,"Please, I know nothing about it."
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,I didn't kill anyone.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,"Morla of Cantaba Street, Prefect."
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,I was there.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,I have nothing to hide.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,"I know it was wrong, but I just couldn't help myself."
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,"I loved her, and when she went over to the table with these men, I could not stand to watch, so I left and went home."
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,"Prefect, I didn't kill anyone."
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,I couldn't.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,"But that doesn't mean anything, Captain, with a room that small."
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,The lights were out.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,Anyone would've had time to kill the lady.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,I'm not sure.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,"Walking home, I assume."
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,I was angry.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,I've never done violence in my life.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,I don't think I could.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,You've got to believe me.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,I wouldn't kill her.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,I couldn't.
MORLA,Wolf In The Fold,"I loved her, and she loved me."

KIRK,The Changeling,"Any response from the Malurians, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,The Changeling,What about the Federation science team working there?
KIRK,The Changeling,Doctor Manway had a special transmitter.
KIRK,The Changeling,They have to answer.
KIRK,The Changeling,That can't be.
KIRK,The Changeling,The last census reported a total inhabitation of more than four billion people.
KIRK,The Changeling,That's impossible.
KIRK,The Changeling,What could have happened?
KIRK,The Changeling,Any other possibilities?
KIRK,The Changeling,"Evasive manoeuvres, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Full power to the shields, Mister Scott."
KIRK,The Changeling,"All hands, Red Alert."
KIRK,The Changeling,Phaser banks stand by.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Photon torpedoes to Condition Red, Condition Red."
KIRK,The Changeling,Good.
KIRK,The Changeling,Ninety?
KIRK,The Changeling,"I think we can expect others, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Mister Spock, pinpoint the source."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Mister Sulu, evasive manoeuvres."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command."
KIRK,The Changeling,Patch in my log.
KIRK,The Changeling,Tell them what has happened.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Tell them the entire Malurian race seems to have been destroyed by an unknown agency, and that we are under attack by an unidentified force."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Helmsmen, I said evasive manoeuvres."
KIRK,The Changeling,Scotty?
KIRK,The Changeling,"Mister Spock, speed of those bolts."
KIRK,The Changeling,Then we can't out run them.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Good, Scotty."
KIRK,The Changeling,You're doing the right thing.
KIRK,The Changeling,"(another hit) Source, Spock."
KIRK,The Changeling,"That's our target, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Changeling,Prepare photon torpedo.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Has the target changed location, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Changeling,"Ready photon torpedo number two, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Changeling,Fire.
KIRK,The Changeling,Absorbed it?
KIRK,The Changeling,"There must be damage to your instruments, Spock ."
KIRK,The Changeling,But what could have absorbed that much energy and survived?
KIRK,The Changeling,"Lieutenant, try to make contact."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Can we take it, Mister Scott?"
KIRK,The Changeling,"Anything, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,The Changeling,Translator computer.
KIRK,The Changeling,All hailing frequencies open.
KIRK,The Changeling,To unidentified vessel.
KIRK,The Changeling,This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise.
KIRK,The Changeling,We are on a peaceful mission.
KIRK,The Changeling,We mean no harm to you or any lifeforms.
KIRK,The Changeling,Please communicate with us.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Any further readings, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Changeling,Five hundred kilos and only one metre long?
KIRK,The Changeling,"Put it on audio, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Changeling,Analysis sector.
KIRK,The Changeling,Have them study and decode it.
KIRK,The Changeling,Can you decode it?
KIRK,The Changeling,Repeat what?
KIRK,The Changeling,The message I sent?
KIRK,The Changeling,This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise.
KIRK,The Changeling,We are on a peaceful mission in this part of the galaxy.
KIRK,The Changeling,We have no hostile intentions.
KIRK,The Changeling,We request identity.
KIRK,The Changeling,Tie in the ship's translator to the communication channel.
KIRK,The Changeling,Let them take it at their own speed.
KIRK,The Changeling,I guess they can take it faster than we give it.
KIRK,The Changeling,Apparently they got what they needed before the computers burned out.
KIRK,The Changeling,It is impossible to come aboard your ship because of the size differential.
KIRK,The Changeling,We are prepared to beam you aboard our ship.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Do you require any special conditions, any particular atmosphere or environment?"
KIRK,The Changeling,Good.
KIRK,The Changeling,Hold your position.
KIRK,The Changeling,We're locked onto your co-ordinates.
KIRK,The Changeling,We'll beam you aboard.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Do we have any choice, Scotty?"
KIRK,The Changeling,"Besides, once it's aboard, it won't be taking any more shots at us."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Lieutenant, get a repair crew on that computer."
KIRK,The Changeling,Get Doctor McCoy down to the transporter room.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Spock, you come with me."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Scotty, you too."
KIRK,The Changeling,Energise.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Sensor readings, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Changeling,We are from the United Federation of Planets.
KIRK,The Changeling,"If we show it a close-up view of our system, it has no point of reference."
KIRK,The Changeling,It won't know more than it does now.
KIRK,The Changeling,"If you care to leave your ship, we'll provide the necessary life support systems."
KIRK,The Changeling,Wasn't there a probe called Nomad launched in the early 2000s?
KIRK,The Changeling,I will bring them.
KIRK,The Changeling,This way.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Now, Scotty, get our warp power up to full capacity."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Spock, Bones, come with us."
KIRK,The Changeling,14A.
KIRK,The Changeling,"(a diagram of our solar system comes up on a screen) Nomad, can you scan that?"
KIRK,The Changeling,"This is our point of origin, the star we know as Sol."
KIRK,The Changeling,Yes.
KIRK,The Changeling,Yes.
KIRK,The Changeling,Yes.
KIRK,The Changeling,What sterilisation procedure?
KIRK,The Changeling,"Yes, he is."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Sometimes, but tell him your function nevertheless."
KIRK,The Changeling,Biological infestation.
KIRK,The Changeling,There was never any probe sent out for that.
KIRK,The Changeling,Did you destroy the Malurian system?
KIRK,The Changeling,Doctor.
KIRK,The Changeling,Why do you call me the creator?
KIRK,The Changeling,"Well, I"
KIRK,The Changeling,Mister Singh.
KIRK,The Changeling,Come here a moment.
KIRK,The Changeling,This unit will see to your needs.
KIRK,The Changeling,I'll be back in a moment.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Gentlemen, come with me."
KIRK,The Changeling,"You're on to something, Spock."
KIRK,The Changeling,What is it?
KIRK,The Changeling,Nomad was destroyed.
KIRK,The Changeling,I heard some lectures at the Academy on the Nomad probe.
KIRK,The Changeling,Its mission was essentially peaceful.
KIRK,The Changeling,Jackson Roykirk.
KIRK,The Changeling,Captain James Kirk.
KIRK,The Changeling,"What do we have on Nomad itself, Spock?"
KIRK,The Changeling,Its purpose was certainly altered.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Its directive, to seek out and destroy biological infestations, could not have been programmed into it."
KIRK,The Changeling,"If what you say is true, then we've taken aboard our vessel a device which sooner or later must destroy us."
KIRK,The Changeling,Security.
KIRK,The Changeling,This is the captain.
KIRK,The Changeling,The mechanism we brought aboard is in the auxiliary control room.
KIRK,The Changeling,Have a security team meet me there in five minutes.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Security, cancel that order."
KIRK,The Changeling,Implement a full search for the mechanism.
KIRK,The Changeling,All decks report to me here.
KIRK,The Changeling,Captain here.
KIRK,The Changeling,"On my way, Scotty."
KIRK,The Changeling,Scotty!
KIRK,The Changeling,Bones.
KIRK,The Changeling,Why did you kill him?
KIRK,The Changeling,That unit was my Chief Engineer.
KIRK,The Changeling,(silence) Lieutenant.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Lieutenant, are you all right?"
KIRK,The Changeling,Sickbay.
KIRK,The Changeling,What did you do to her?
KIRK,The Changeling,Get Scott down below.
KIRK,The Changeling,He's dead.
KIRK,The Changeling,His biological functions have ceased.
KIRK,The Changeling,"All right, Nomad."
KIRK,The Changeling,Repair the unit.
KIRK,The Changeling,"It serves me as it is, Nomad."
KIRK,The Changeling,Repair it.
KIRK,The Changeling,Doctor McCoy will show you.
KIRK,The Changeling,Security.
KIRK,The Changeling,"I want a twenty four hour, two man armed surveillance on Nomad."
KIRK,The Changeling,Pick it up in Sickbay.
KIRK,The Changeling,It's all right.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Scotty, she's being taken care of."
KIRK,The Changeling,It's all right.
KIRK,The Changeling,Doctor McCoy will explain it to you.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Nomad, come here."
KIRK,The Changeling,Repair that unit.
KIRK,The Changeling,You restored Scott.
KIRK,The Changeling,He had much more extensive damage.
KIRK,The Changeling,Bones?
KIRK,The Changeling,Yes.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Nomad, you will go with these units."
KIRK,The Changeling,(the two red-shirts) They will take you to a waiting area.
KIRK,The Changeling,Take it to the top security cell.
KIRK,The Changeling,"It's a killer, Spock."
KIRK,The Changeling,I intend to render it harmless.
KIRK,The Changeling,Get down to the Brig.
KIRK,The Changeling,Run a full analysis on the mechanism.
KIRK,The Changeling,I want to know what makes that thing tick.
KIRK,The Changeling,What's the problem?
KIRK,The Changeling,"Nomad, you will allow Mister Spock to probe your memory banks and structure."
KIRK,The Changeling,Yes.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Follow your instructions, Nomad."
KIRK,The Changeling,"We've got to know about it, Spock."
KIRK,The Changeling,"what makes it operate, its compulsion for perfection."
KIRK,The Changeling,Get into direct mental contact with that thing?
KIRK,The Changeling,You saw what it did to Uhura.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Nomad, the unit Spock will touch you."
KIRK,The Changeling,It is not an attack.
KIRK,The Changeling,It is a form of communication.
KIRK,The Changeling,You will permit it.
KIRK,The Changeling,Spock.
KIRK,The Changeling,Spock!
KIRK,The Changeling,Nomad!
KIRK,The Changeling,You're in contact with the unit Spock.
KIRK,The Changeling,Stop!
KIRK,The Changeling,Stop!
KIRK,The Changeling,Spock.
KIRK,The Changeling,Spock?
KIRK,The Changeling,"What does it mean, we are Nomad?"
KIRK,The Changeling,Then it isn't Nomad?
KIRK,The Changeling,A changeling.
KIRK,The Changeling,"An ancient Earth legend, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Changeling,A changeling was a fairy child that was left in place of a human baby.
KIRK,The Changeling,The changeling assumed the identity of the human child.
KIRK,The Changeling,"So, it is to sterilise, and for sterilise read kill."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Yes, it's powerful, it's sophisticated, but it's not infallible."
KIRK,The Changeling,It's space-happy.
KIRK,The Changeling,It thinks I'm its mother.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Nomad, stop what you're doing."
KIRK,The Changeling,Scotty?
KIRK,The Changeling,You will destroy my ship.
KIRK,The Changeling,Its structure cannot stand the stress of that much power.
KIRK,The Changeling,Turn off your repair operation.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Mister Scott, give Sulu warp two and keep her there."
KIRK,The Changeling,You killed two of my
KIRK,The Changeling,"Nomad, it's about time I told you who and what you are!"
KIRK,The Changeling,"I'm a biological unit, and I created you."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Nomad, there are two men waiting outside."
KIRK,The Changeling,You will not harm them.
KIRK,The Changeling,They will escort you back to the waiting area.
KIRK,The Changeling,You will stay there.
KIRK,The Changeling,You will do nothing.
KIRK,The Changeling,I have given you new programming and you will implement it.
KIRK,The Changeling,Reevaluate?
KIRK,The Changeling,It was a foolish mistake.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Spock, do you think it's possible that it got a fix on Earth when it tapped the computers earlier?"
KIRK,The Changeling,And we've shown it the way home.
KIRK,The Changeling,And when it gets there
KIRK,The Changeling,And it will carry out its prime directive.
KIRK,The Changeling,Sterilise.
KIRK,The Changeling,Manual controls.
KIRK,The Changeling,(The doors open and Nomad comes out.
KIRK,The Changeling,Nomad.
KIRK,The Changeling,Nomad?
KIRK,The Changeling,Stop.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Nomad, stop!"
KIRK,The Changeling,Nomad.
KIRK,The Changeling,Is she all right?
KIRK,The Changeling,What happened?
KIRK,The Changeling,Whose history?
KIRK,The Changeling,And found that its creator is as imperfect as all the other biological units.
KIRK,The Changeling,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Changeling,Nomad.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Get Scotty, some antigravs and meet me in Engineering."
KIRK,The Changeling,Nomad?
KIRK,The Changeling,Stop what you're doing and effect repairs on the life-support systems.
KIRK,The Changeling,You're programmed to obey the orders of your creator.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Nomad, I admit that biological units are imperfect, but a biological unit created you."
KIRK,The Changeling,"No, you're not Nomad."
KIRK,The Changeling,You're an alien machine.
KIRK,The Changeling,Your programming tapes have been altered.
KIRK,The Changeling,But I am your creator.
KIRK,The Changeling,I created you?
KIRK,The Changeling,But I admit I'm imperfect.
KIRK,The Changeling,How could I have created such a perfect thing as you?
KIRK,The Changeling,Then you will continue to destroy that which thinks and lives and is imperfect?
KIRK,The Changeling,You must sterilise in case of error?
KIRK,The Changeling,Everything that is in error must be sterilised.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Nomad, I made an error in creating you."
KIRK,The Changeling,I did not create perfection.
KIRK,The Changeling,I created error.
KIRK,The Changeling,"I am the Kirk, the creator?"
KIRK,The Changeling,You are wrong!
KIRK,The Changeling,"Jackson Roykirk, your creator, is dead."
KIRK,The Changeling,You have mistaken me for him.
KIRK,The Changeling,You are in error.
KIRK,The Changeling,You did not discover your mistake.
KIRK,The Changeling,You have made two errors.
KIRK,The Changeling,You are flawed and imperfect and you have not corrected by sterilisation.
KIRK,The Changeling,You have made three errors.
KIRK,The Changeling,You are flawed and imperfect!
KIRK,The Changeling,Execute your prime function!
KIRK,The Changeling,Now.
KIRK,The Changeling,Get those antigravs on it.
KIRK,The Changeling,We've got to get rid of it while it's trying to think.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Scotty, the transporter room."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Scotty, set the controls for deep space."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Two ten, mark one."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Nomad, you are imperfect!"
KIRK,The Changeling,Exercise your prime function.
KIRK,The Changeling,Now!
KIRK,The Changeling,"You didn't think I had it in me, did you Spock?"
KIRK,The Changeling,"Good, Bones, good."
KIRK,The Changeling,What?
KIRK,The Changeling,Which might well have destroyed more billions of lives.
KIRK,The Changeling,It's well gone.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Besides, what are you feeling so badly about?"
KIRK,The Changeling,It's not easy to lose a bright and promising son.
KIRK,The Changeling,"Well, it thought I was its mother, didn't it?"
KIRK,The Changeling,"Do you think I'm completely without feelings, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Changeling,You saw what it did for Scotty.
KIRK,The Changeling,What a doctor it would've made.
KIRK,The Changeling,"My son, the doctor."
KIRK,The Changeling,"Kind of gets you right there, doesn't it?"
UHURA,The Changeling,"Nothing since their original distress call, sir."
UHURA,The Changeling,"There's nothing, sir."
UHURA,The Changeling,I'm scanning all frequencies.
UHURA,The Changeling,"First attack, sir?"
UHURA,The Changeling,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,The Changeling,"I'm trying, sir."
UHURA,The Changeling,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,The Changeling,All hailing frequencies open.
UHURA,The Changeling,"Captain, we're getting a signal from the spacecraft."
UHURA,The Changeling,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,The Changeling,"It's impossible to get it any clearer, sir."
UHURA,The Changeling,"Analysis sector, channel one, main computer."
UHURA,The Changeling,Decode.
UHURA,The Changeling,It's mathematical.
UHURA,The Changeling,"Yes, one symbol."
UHURA,The Changeling,The symbol repeat.
UHURA,The Changeling,"Sir, that isn't in the Starfleet code."
UHURA,The Changeling,It's an old-style interplanetary code.
UHURA,The Changeling,"It's another signal now, sir."
UHURA,The Changeling,"Aye, Captain."
UHURA,The Changeling,"Captain, the message is coming in now."
UHURA,The Changeling,Doctor McCoy to the transporter room.
UHURA,The Changeling,Maintenance crew C5.
UHURA,The Changeling,Bridge to auxiliary control room.
UHURA,The Changeling,"Check in, please."
UHURA,The Changeling,Mister Scott's engineers are working on them now.
UHURA,The Changeling,Report to him when your indicators are registering properly.
UHURA,The Changeling,Anything else?
UHURA,The Changeling,Holding.
UHURA,The Changeling,"(singing while Singh checks some boards) Where my heart is, Where my heart is."
UHURA,The Changeling,Somewhere beyond the stars.
UHURA,The Changeling,Beyond Antares.
UHURA,The Changeling,"Where my heart is, Where a scented miracle"
UHURA,The Changeling,"Tomorrow the path along the way, There's where my love"
UHURA,The Changeling,What?
UHURA,The Changeling,I don't know what it.
UHURA,The Changeling,"(realises) Oh, my singing."
UHURA,The Changeling,I was singing.
UHURA,The Changeling,I don't know.
UHURA,The Changeling,I like to sing.
UHURA,The Changeling,I felt like music.
UHURA,The Changeling,See the dog.
UHURA,The Changeling,"See the dog,"
UHURA,The Changeling,"R, r, run!"
UHURA,The Changeling,"The dog has a, The dog, (something)"
UHURA,The Changeling,"(Swahili, then) The dog has a ball."
UHURA,The Changeling,"All right, Christine."
UHURA,The Changeling,The ball is bl-u-ee.
UHURA,The Changeling,Bl-u-ey.
UHURA,The Changeling,Bluey?
SPOCK,The Changeling,Captain.
SPOCK,The Changeling,They will not answer.
SPOCK,The Changeling,The long-range sensor sweep of this system reveals no sign of life.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"I register no life readings at all, sir."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"We would have known in advance of any system-wide catastrophe, and in the event of an interplanetary war, there would be considerable radioactive residue."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Our instruments show only normal background radiation.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Unknown, sir."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Sensor readings would have revealed the presence of any disease organisms.
SPOCK,The Changeling,They do not.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"In addition, we received the routine report from this system only a week ago."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Even the Symbalene blood burn does not act that swiftly.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"An extremely powerful bolt of energy, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Temporarily, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Our shields absorbed energy equivalent to ninety of our photon torpedoes.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"I may add, the energy used repulsing this first attack reduced our shielding power twenty percent."
SPOCK,The Changeling,We can resist three more such attacks.
SPOCK,The Changeling,The fourth will shatter our shields completely.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Approximately warp fifteen, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Unknown, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Nothing within sensor range.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"(a third bolt approaching) Something now, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Very small.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Bearing one two three degrees, mark one eight."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Range ninety thousand kilometres.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"No, sir."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Holding steady.
SPOCK,The Changeling,No effect.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Target absorbed full energy of our torpedo.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"They are in good working order, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Captain, shields are down."
SPOCK,The Changeling,We cannot survive another hit.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Computing now, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Weight, five hundred kilograms."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Shape, roughly cylindrical."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Length, a fraction over one metre."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Intelligence does not necessarily require bulk, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Captain, this message is a sort of binary."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Extremely sophisticated, compressed, carrying several channels at once."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"No clue as yet, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,A moment.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Transmission speed has stepped down.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Much slower.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Seems to be a single binary.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Fascinating.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"It would seem so, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"It's a formula, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,They're sending us a mathematical message and requesting language equivalence.
SPOCK,The Changeling,They're trying to communicate.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Cut power, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Overloaded and burned out.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Nomad?
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,It has a protective screen.
SPOCK,The Changeling,I cannot get through.
SPOCK,The Changeling,A reasonable course.
SPOCK,The Changeling,It is reacting much like a highly sophisticated computer.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"An opinion is a belief, a view, a judgment."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Yes.
SPOCK,The Changeling,It was reported destroyed.
SPOCK,The Changeling,There were no more in the series.
SPOCK,The Changeling,But if this is that probe
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Chart 14A, sir?"
SPOCK,The Changeling,I believe the history computer can answer that question.
SPOCK,The Changeling,I'll have the readout in a moment.
SPOCK,The Changeling,The usage is correct.
SPOCK,The Changeling,The creator was simply testing your memory banks.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"I've correlated all the available information on the Nomad probe, and I'm convinced that this object is indeed that probe."
SPOCK,The Changeling,True.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Presumed destroyed by a meteor collision.
SPOCK,The Changeling,I submit that it was badly damaged and somehow managed to repair itself.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"This is the creator of Nomad, perhaps the most brilliant though erratic scientist of his time."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"His dream was to build a perfect thinking machine, capable of independent logic."
SPOCK,The Changeling,You recall his name.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Yes.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Similar.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Captain, I believe that Nomad thinks you are Roykirk."
SPOCK,The Changeling,That may well be why the attack was broken off.
SPOCK,The Changeling,It responded to your name as well as its damaged memory banks permitted.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Essentially it is, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Changeling,I believe that more happened to it than just damage in the meteor collision.
SPOCK,The Changeling,It mentioned the other.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"The unanswered question is, the other what?"
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Precisely, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Changeling,And somehow that programming has been changed.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"It would seem that Nomad is now seeking out perfect life-forms, perfection being measured by its own relentless logic."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Captain, Mister Singh reports that Nomad is no longer in the auxiliary control room."
SPOCK,The Changeling,That unit is a woman.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Nomad, I have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed of the computer."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Please do not draw the information faster than the machine's capacity.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Fascinating.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Well, Doctor?"
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Captain, if that is correct, if there has been no brain damage but only knowledge erased, she could be re-educated."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Does the creator wish Nomad to wait elsewhere?
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Doctor, I interrupted you because Nomad would not have understood your anger."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"It has great technical skill, but its reaction to emotion is unpredictable."
SPOCK,The Changeling,It almost qualifies as a life-form.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"The study of it would be of great use, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"An almost human stubbornness, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,I have been unable to convince Nomad to lower its screens for analysis.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Without its co-operation, I can do nothing."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Thank you.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"It is not sufficient, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"I get certain references to the accident, the other, but nothing clear."
SPOCK,The Changeling,There are areas I simply cannot scan.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Captain, I suggest the Vulcan mind probe."
SPOCK,The Changeling,It seems the only way.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"There is a risk, but I have formed a partial hypothesis."
SPOCK,The Changeling,I must check it out.
SPOCK,The Changeling,I.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Am.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Nomad.
SPOCK,The Changeling,I am performing my function.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Deep emptiness, It approaches."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Collision.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Damage.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Blackness.
SPOCK,The Changeling,I.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Am.
SPOCK,The Changeling,The other.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"I am Tan Ru, Tan Ru."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Nomad.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Tan Ru.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Error.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Flaw.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Imperfection.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Must sterilise.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Rebirth.
SPOCK,The Changeling,We are complete.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Much power.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Gun ta.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Noo.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Icka.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Tan Ru.
SPOCK,The Changeling,The creator instructs.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Search out.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Identify.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Sterilise imperfections.
SPOCK,The Changeling,We are Nomad.
SPOCK,The Changeling,We are Nomad.
SPOCK,The Changeling,We are complete.
SPOCK,The Changeling,We are instructed.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Our purpose is clear.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Sterilise imperfections.
SPOCK,The Changeling,(he lets go of Nomad) Sterilise imperfections.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Nomad.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Sterilise.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Sterilise.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Nomad, sterilise,"
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Fascinating, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,The knowledge.
SPOCK,The Changeling,The depth.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"It was, it was damaged in deep space."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Undoubtedly, the meteor collision."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Its memory banks were destroyed, or most of them."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"It wandered without purpose, and then it met the other."
SPOCK,The Changeling,The other was an alien probe of great power.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Somehow they merged, repaired each other, became one."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Not the Nomad we lost from Earth.
SPOCK,The Changeling,It took from the other a new directive to replace its own.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"The other was originally programmed to secure and sterilise soil samples from other planets, probably as a prelude to colonisation."
SPOCK,The Changeling,I beg your pardon?
SPOCK,The Changeling,And that is the only thing that has saved us until now.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Captain.
SPOCK,The Changeling,I've examined the brig.
SPOCK,The Changeling,The forcefield door on the security cell is damaged and the guards have vanished.
SPOCK,The Changeling,I must assume they are dead.
SPOCK,The Changeling,I suspect it is about to re-evaluate its creator.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Captain, it may have been unwise to admit to Nomad that you are a biological unit."
SPOCK,The Changeling,"In Nomad's eyes, you must now undoubtedly appear imperfect."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Even worse.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Nomad just now made a reference to its launch point, Earth."
SPOCK,The Changeling,I do not believe there is much beyond Nomad's capabilities.
SPOCK,The Changeling,It will find the Earth infested with imperfect biological units.
SPOCK,The Changeling,No response.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Since it specifically examined your history, I suggest it has completed its re-evaluation."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Undoubtedly.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"Your logic was impeccable, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,We are in grave danger.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"My congratulations, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,A dazzling display of logic.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"No, sir."
SPOCK,The Changeling,Remarkable.
SPOCK,The Changeling,"The destruction of Nomad was a great waste, Captain."
SPOCK,The Changeling,It was a remarkable instrument.
SPOCK,The Changeling,Sir?
SULU,The Changeling,"Captain, shields just snapped on."
SULU,The Changeling,Something heading in at multiwarp speeds.
SULU,The Changeling,It's going to hit.
SULU,The Changeling,"Aye, sir."
SULU,The Changeling,"We're losing power, sir."
SULU,The Changeling,"Photon torpedoes armed, sir."
SULU,The Changeling,"Ready, sir."
SULU,The Changeling,Torpedo away.
SULU,The Changeling,"(a pause, then a flash) Direct hit."
SULU,The Changeling,"Sir, they've fired another."
SCOTT,The Changeling,Giving them all we got.
SCOTT,The Changeling,"Shields still holding, sir."
SCOTT,The Changeling,"I'm having to divert the warp engine power into the shields, sir, if you want the protection."
SCOTT,The Changeling,"Shields still holding, sir, but the drain on the engines is reaching the critical point."
SCOTT,The Changeling,"Ach, we lost warp manoeuvreing power."
SCOTT,The Changeling,Switching to impulse.
SCOTT,The Changeling,"That's problematical, sir."
SCOTT,The Changeling,What kind of intelligent creatures can exist in a thing that small?
SCOTT,The Changeling,"Captain, you're not really bringing that thing in here?"
SCOTT,The Changeling,Energising.
SCOTT,The Changeling,.
SCOTT,The Changeling,"In my opinion, that's a machine."
SCOTT,The Changeling,What's your source of power?
SCOTT,The Changeling,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Changeling,(whispering) Bridge to Captain.
SCOTT,The Changeling,That mechanical beastie is up here.
SCOTT,The Changeling,Lieutenant!
SCOTT,The Changeling,Keep away from that
SCOTT,The Changeling,What are the lot of you staring at me for?
SCOTT,The Changeling,How did I get here?
SCOTT,The Changeling,How did I (sees Nomad)
SCOTT,The Changeling,That thing did something to Lieutenant Uhura!
SCOTT,The Changeling,What did it do to me?
SCOTT,The Changeling,Notify the captain.
SCOTT,The Changeling,What are you doing here?
SCOTT,The Changeling,"Watch your panels, everyone."
SCOTT,The Changeling,Watch that polymass.
SCOTT,The Changeling,"Roger, help with the interfactor."
SCOTT,The Changeling,Leave that alone.
SCOTT,The Changeling,Aye.
SCOTT,The Changeling,How are you doing that?
SCOTT,The Changeling,Throw your dampers.
SCOTT,The Changeling,"Cut your circuits, all of them."
SCOTT,The Changeling,Impossible.
SCOTT,The Changeling,It can't go that fast.
SCOTT,The Changeling,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Changeling,Bridge to Captain.
SCOTT,The Changeling,Life support systems are out all over the ship.
SCOTT,The Changeling,Manual override has been blocked.
SCOTT,The Changeling,"Source, Engineering."
SCOTT,The Changeling,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Changeling,Energising.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"USS Enterprise, this is Nomad."
NOMAD,The Changeling,My mission is non-hostile.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Require communication.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Can you leave your ship?
NOMAD,The Changeling,Non sequitur.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Your facts are uncoordinated.
NOMAD,The Changeling,That will be satisfactory.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Negative.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I will come aboard.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Relate your point of origin.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Insufficient response.
NOMAD,The Changeling,All things have a point of origin.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I will scan your star charts.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Non sequitur.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Your facts are uncoordinated.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I contain no parasitical beings.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I am Nomad.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I am Nomad.
NOMAD,The Changeling,What is opinion?
NOMAD,The Changeling,Insufficient response.
NOMAD,The Changeling,It has changed since the point of origin.
NOMAD,The Changeling,There was much taken from the other.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I am perpetual now.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I am Nomad.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I will scan your star charts.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I have the capability of movement within your ship.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Yes.
NOMAD,The Changeling,You are from the third planet?
NOMAD,The Changeling,A planet with one large natural satellite?
NOMAD,The Changeling,The planet is called Earth?
NOMAD,The Changeling,"You are the creator, the Kirk."
NOMAD,The Changeling,The sterilisation procedure against your ship was unnecessary.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"You are the Kirk, the creator."
NOMAD,The Changeling,You programmed my function.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"This is one of your units, creator?"
NOMAD,The Changeling,It functions irrationally.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"My function is to probe for biological infestations, to destroy that which is not perfect."
NOMAD,The Changeling,I am Nomad.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"Not the system, creator Kirk."
NOMAD,The Changeling,Only the unstable biological infestation.
NOMAD,The Changeling,It is my function.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Is the usage incorrect?
NOMAD,The Changeling,There was much damage in the accident.
NOMAD,The Changeling,What is the meaning?
NOMAD,The Changeling,What form of communication?
NOMAD,The Changeling,For what purpose is singing?
NOMAD,The Changeling,What is music?
NOMAD,The Changeling,(a ray of light envelopes her head) Think about music.
NOMAD,The Changeling,The unit touched my screens.
NOMAD,The Changeling,That unit is defective.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Its thinking is chaotic.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Absorbing it unsettled me.
NOMAD,The Changeling,A mass of conflicting impulses.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Will the creator effect repairs on the unit Scott?
NOMAD,The Changeling,Insufficient response.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Does the creator wish me to repair the unit?
NOMAD,The Changeling,I require tapes on the structure.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Proceed.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"(a few moments later) Creator, the unit Scott is a primitive structure."
NOMAD,The Changeling,Insufficient safeguards built in.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Breakdown can occur from many causes.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Self-maintenance systems of low reliability.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Where is the unit Scott now?
NOMAD,The Changeling,Show me Sickbay.
NOMAD,The Changeling,The unit Scott is repaired.
NOMAD,The Changeling,It will function correctly if your information to me was correct.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Not possible.
NOMAD,The Changeling,The unit Scott required simple structural repair.
NOMAD,The Changeling,The knowledge banks of this unit have been wiped clean.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"Mister Spock is also one of your biological units, Creator?"
NOMAD,The Changeling,This unit is different.
NOMAD,The Changeling,It is well-ordered.
NOMAD,The Changeling,My screens are down.
NOMAD,The Changeling,You may proceed.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"I will permit it, Creator."
NOMAD,The Changeling,Acknowledged.
NOMAD,The Changeling,This primitive matter-antimatter propulsion system is the main drive?
NOMAD,The Changeling,Inefficiency exists in the antimatter input valve.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I will effect repair.
NOMAD,The Changeling,The energy release controls are also most inefficient.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I shall effect repair.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"Is there a problem, Creator?"
NOMAD,The Changeling,I have increased engine efficiency fifty seven percent.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Acknowledged.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"It is reversed as ordered, Creator."
NOMAD,The Changeling,"Creator, your biological units are inefficient."
NOMAD,The Changeling,(pause) Non sequitur.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Biological units are inherently inferior.
NOMAD,The Changeling,This is an inconsistency.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I am programmed to investigate.
NOMAD,The Changeling,There is much to be considered before I return to launch point.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I must re-evaluate.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Stop.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I am programmed to destroy those life-forms which are imperfect.
NOMAD,The Changeling,These alterations will do so without destroying the vessel which surrounds them.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"It, too, is imperfect, but can be adjusted."
NOMAD,The Changeling,I am perfect.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I am Nomad.
NOMAD,The Changeling,You are in error.
NOMAD,The Changeling,You are a biological unit.
NOMAD,The Changeling,You are imperfect.
NOMAD,The Changeling,You are the Creator.
NOMAD,The Changeling,You are the Creator.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Answer unknown.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I shall analyse.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Analysis complete.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"Insufficient data to resolve problem, but my programming is whole."
NOMAD,The Changeling,My purpose remains.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I am Nomad.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I am perfect.
NOMAD,The Changeling,That which is imperfect must be sterilised.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I shall continue.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I shall return to launch point Earth.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I shall sterilise.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Error is inconsistent with my prime functions.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Sterilisation is correction.
NOMAD,The Changeling,There are no exceptions.
NOMAD,The Changeling,The creation of perfection is no error.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Your data is faulty.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I am Nomad.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I am perfect.
NOMAD,The Changeling,You are the Creator.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Error.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Error.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Error.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Examine.
NOMAD,The Changeling,I shall analyse error.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"Analyse error,"
NOMAD,The Changeling,Examine error.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Error.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Analyse error.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Error.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Faulty!
NOMAD,The Changeling,Faulty!
NOMAD,The Changeling,Error.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Error.
NOMAD,The Changeling,Faulty!
NOMAD,The Changeling,Faulty!
NOMAD,The Changeling,Must sterilise.
NOMAD,The Changeling,"Sterilise,"
MCCOY,The Changeling,"They've got the co-ordinates, Jim."
MCCOY,The Changeling,It's locked in.
MCCOY,The Changeling,"What do we do now, go up and knock?"
MCCOY,The Changeling,"Jim, I don't think anybody's in there."
MCCOY,The Changeling,"Well, I'm not the Kirk."
MCCOY,The Changeling,Tell me what your function is.
MCCOY,The Changeling,Unstable infestation?
MCCOY,The Changeling,The population of four planets?
MCCOY,The Changeling,What kind of function
MCCOY,The Changeling,Ridiculous.
MCCOY,The Changeling,Earth science couldn't begin to build anything with those capabilities that long ago.
MCCOY,The Changeling,Of course.
MCCOY,The Changeling,Jackson Roykirk.
MCCOY,The Changeling,(looking at the schematic on the monitor) That's not the same.
MCCOY,The Changeling,"As I recall, it wasn't."
MCCOY,The Changeling,It was supposed to be the first interstellar probe to seek new life-forms.
MCCOY,The Changeling,"He's dead, Jim."
MCCOY,The Changeling,"There's nothing I can do, Jim."
MCCOY,The Changeling,"If there's a chance, it'll have to be soon."
MCCOY,The Changeling,"Well, he'll need tapes on general anatomy, the central nervous system, and then one on the physiological structure of the brain."
MCCOY,The Changeling,"We'd better give it all the neurological studies we have, as well as tracings of Scotty's hyperencephalogram."
MCCOY,The Changeling,The body is in Sickbay.
MCCOY,The Changeling,I could have told you that without looking.
MCCOY,The Changeling,It's unbelievable.
MCCOY,The Changeling,Take it easy.
MCCOY,The Changeling,"Lie down, Scotty."
MCCOY,The Changeling,We just want to check you out.
MCCOY,The Changeling,"I'd like to check it out, if you don't mind."
MCCOY,The Changeling,A man is not just a biological unit that you can patch together.
MCCOY,The Changeling,"Nurse, I want him prepared for a full physical examination."
MCCOY,The Changeling,Yes.
MCCOY,The Changeling,I'll get on it right away.
MCCOY,The Changeling,"Oh, and in spite of the way you repaired Scotty, you metal ticking"
MCCOY,The Changeling,That's a laugh.
MCCOY,The Changeling,How's she doing?
MCCOY,The Changeling,"Well, she checks out with no brain damage."
MCCOY,The Changeling,We've got all the educational tapes in our library.
MCCOY,The Changeling,Now it's up to us.
MCCOY,The Changeling,Captain Kirk to Sickbay.
MCCOY,The Changeling,Emergency.
MCCOY,The Changeling,I think so.
MCCOY,The Changeling,Looks like some kind of shock.
MCCOY,The Changeling,Nomad examined the personnel files and the medical histories.
MCCOY,The Changeling,She tried to stop him.
MCCOY,The Changeling,Yours.
MCCOY,The Changeling,"Jim, with all the systems out we'll only have enough air and heat for"
MCCOY,The Changeling,I thought you might like to know that Lieutenant Uhura is back to college level.
MCCOY,The Changeling,She'll be back on the job within a week.
SINGH,The Changeling,Sir?
SINGH,The Changeling,Did I disturb you?
SINGH,The Changeling,Did you wish anything?
SINGH,The Changeling,Lieutenant Singh here.
SINGH,The Changeling,All systems are normal except warp power indicators.
SINGH,The Changeling,"One moment, Lieutenant."
CARLISLE,The Changeling,Lieutenant Carlisle here.
CARLISLE,The Changeling,"Aye, sir."
CARLISLE,The Changeling,Acknowledge.
CHAPEL,The Changeling,"No reaction, Doctor."
CHAPEL,The Changeling,"Yes, sir."
CHAPEL,The Changeling,Sound it out.
CHAPEL,The Changeling,"That's it, Uhura."
CHAPEL,The Changeling,That's very good.
CHAPEL,The Changeling,Now try the next one.
CHAPEL,The Changeling,"Not Swahili, Uhura."
CHAPEL,The Changeling,In English.
CHAPEL,The Changeling,The dog has a ball.
CHAPEL,The Changeling,See?
CHAPEL,The Changeling,"B, ah, ll."
CHAPEL,The Changeling,Ball.
CHAPEL,The Changeling,Now you go ahead.
CHAPEL,The Changeling,That's right!
CHAPEL,The Changeling,"Oh, that's right, Uhura."
CHAPEL,The Changeling,"(they hug, then McCoy beckons Chapel over) Oh, here."
CHAPEL,The Changeling,You try another one.
CHAPEL,The Changeling,I'll be right back.
CHAPEL,The Changeling,"Well, she's on the first grade reader."
CHAPEL,The Changeling,She's learning.
CHAPEL,The Changeling,Seems to have an aptitude for mathematics.
CHAPEL,The Changeling,"Do you think we can re-educate her, Doctor?"
ENGINEER,The Changeling,"Warp eight, Mister Scott, and increasing."
ENGINEER,The Changeling,Warp nine.
ENGINEER,The Changeling,"Warp 10, Mister Scott."
ENGINEER,The Changeling,"It just won't stop, Mister Scott."
ENGINEER,The Changeling,Warp eleven!
GUARD,The Changeling,Hey.
GUARD,The Changeling,"Nomad, stop."
GUARD,The Changeling,"Nomad, this way."
KIRK,The Apple,Start your readings.
KIRK,The Apple,"It is spectacular, isn't it?"
KIRK,The Apple,"Well, the last scout ship reported some pretty strange sensor readings."
KIRK,The Apple,Starfleet wants it investigated and the inhabitants contacted.
KIRK,The Apple,We do what we're told.
KIRK,The Apple,Are you sure about that?
KIRK,The Apple,I know.
KIRK,The Apple,Almost impossible.
KIRK,The Apple,Just outside Moscow.
KIRK,The Apple,All right.
KIRK,The Apple,There's a village about seventeen kilometres away on bearing two three two.
KIRK,The Apple,We'll head that way.
KIRK,The Apple,What did somebody say?
KIRK,The Apple,That paradise must've looked like this?
KIRK,The Apple,"As soon as we get out of the way, beam the body up."
KIRK,The Apple,What is it?
KIRK,The Apple,What's causing it?
KIRK,The Apple,But you say there's nothing to worry about?
KIRK,The Apple,"Well, stay on top of it."
KIRK,The Apple,We've got a job to down here.
KIRK,The Apple,We might as well finish it.
KIRK,The Apple,"Yeah, it's nice."
KIRK,The Apple,"If we're a little more careful, we shouldn't run into any more trouble."
KIRK,The Apple,"We'll do the walking, Scotty."
KIRK,The Apple,You get on the antimatter pod.
KIRK,The Apple,"If it gets worse, let me know, we'll beam up."
KIRK,The Apple,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Apple,Scotty will handle it.
KIRK,The Apple,We've got a job to do.
KIRK,The Apple,Turn up anything on your tricorder?
KIRK,The Apple,That's strange.
KIRK,The Apple,Mallory.
KIRK,The Apple,We're heading for the village.
KIRK,The Apple,Avoid contact with the humanoids.
KIRK,The Apple,I want you and Marple to make a full reconnaissance.
KIRK,The Apple,And be careful.
KIRK,The Apple,There may be other dangers besides poisonous plants.
KIRK,The Apple,Keep in constant communication.
KIRK,The Apple,What is it?
KIRK,The Apple,"Mister Chekov, Yeoman Landon."
KIRK,The Apple,"I know you find each other fascinating, but we're not here to conduct a field experiment in human biology."
KIRK,The Apple,"Whatever it is, it moves like a cat."
KIRK,The Apple,Neither do I.
KIRK,The Apple,All hands.
KIRK,The Apple,"We've been watched, we'll probably be watched."
KIRK,The Apple,We're moving out.
KIRK,The Apple,Formation L.
KIRK,The Apple,"Would you mind being careful where you throw your rocks, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Apple,"Garden of Eden, with land mines."
KIRK,The Apple,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Apple,Why?
KIRK,The Apple,"We're heading there now, Scotty."
KIRK,The Apple,You need any help?
KIRK,The Apple,"All right, Scotty."
KIRK,The Apple,We'll try and find out what's going on down here.
KIRK,The Apple,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Apple,Some kind of generator?
KIRK,The Apple,What's that?
KIRK,The Apple,Peculiar stuff to find in paradise.
KIRK,The Apple,"(He pushes the Captain and McCoy out of the way, but takes the thorns in his own chest.)"
KIRK,The Apple,Spock!
KIRK,The Apple,Spock!
KIRK,The Apple,Security alert.
KIRK,The Apple,Is he alive?
KIRK,The Apple,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Apple,We're beaming up.
KIRK,The Apple,Notify transporter room.
KIRK,The Apple,And make arrangements to pick up Mallory and Marple.
KIRK,The Apple,They're scouting ahead of us.
KIRK,The Apple,All hands.
KIRK,The Apple,Energise.
KIRK,The Apple,"Scotty, energise."
KIRK,The Apple,"Scotty, what's the matter?"
KIRK,The Apple,"Scotty, is the transporter malfunction tied in with trouble you're having with the antimatter pods?"
KIRK,The Apple,Spock.
KIRK,The Apple,Are you all right?
KIRK,The Apple,Just what do you think you were trying to do?
KIRK,The Apple,Stepped in front and took the thorns yourself.
KIRK,The Apple,I see.
KIRK,The Apple,"Well next time, just yell."
KIRK,The Apple,I can step out of the way as quickly as the next man.
KIRK,The Apple,Trying to get yourself killed.
KIRK,The Apple,Do you know how much Starfleet has invested in you?
KIRK,The Apple,Never mind.
KIRK,The Apple,But thanks.
KIRK,The Apple,"Kaplan, take the post."
KIRK,The Apple,"Not only is something after us, but it's after the ship as well."
KIRK,The Apple,"Thirty seconds ago, there wasn't a cloud in the sky."
KIRK,The Apple,Come on!
KIRK,The Apple,Phasers.
KIRK,The Apple,"A beautiful day, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Apple,Not a cloud in the sky.
KIRK,The Apple,Just like paradise.
KIRK,The Apple,(The scouting party has reached a collection of round huts - very African.)
KIRK,The Apple,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Apple,Mallory.
KIRK,The Apple,"Mallory, you all right?"
KIRK,The Apple,Come in!
KIRK,The Apple,Mallory.
KIRK,The Apple,"Mallory, you all right?"
KIRK,The Apple,Mallory!
KIRK,The Apple,On the double.
KIRK,The Apple,Mallory!
KIRK,The Apple,"Marple, stand back!"
KIRK,The Apple,Watch it!
KIRK,The Apple,The rocks!
KIRK,The Apple,(kneeling by the body) Kaplan.
KIRK,The Apple,Hendorff.
KIRK,The Apple,I know Kaplan's family.
KIRK,The Apple,Now Mallory.
KIRK,The Apple,His father helped me get into the Academy.
KIRK,The Apple,I could've prevented all of it.
KIRK,The Apple,"A walk in paradise, among the green grass and flowers."
KIRK,The Apple,We should've beamed up at the first sign of trouble.
KIRK,The Apple,I also have the option to disregard those orders if I consider them overly hazardous.
KIRK,The Apple,"This isn't that important a mission, Spock."
KIRK,The Apple,Not worth the lives of three of my men.
KIRK,The Apple,"I drop my guard for a minute because I like the smell of growing things, and now three men are dead."
KIRK,The Apple,And the ship's in trouble.
KIRK,The Apple,"Marple, Chekov, at attention."
KIRK,The Apple,"Gentlemen, something or someone is behind that rock."
KIRK,The Apple,I want it.
KIRK,The Apple,"Marple, cut around the rock to your right."
KIRK,The Apple,Make a loud noise.
KIRK,The Apple,Be careful.
KIRK,The Apple,"(Marple leaves) Spock, you and Chekov create a diversion and make it loud."
KIRK,The Apple,I won't hurt you.
KIRK,The Apple,Do you understand?
KIRK,The Apple,I won't hurt you.
KIRK,The Apple,"Well, I won't strike you again."
KIRK,The Apple,"You've been following us, watching us."
KIRK,The Apple,Why?
KIRK,The Apple,Who is Vaal?
KIRK,The Apple,Do you have a name?
KIRK,The Apple,They're not going to hurt you.
KIRK,The Apple,I promise you.
KIRK,The Apple,"Akuta, Akuta, we come in peace."
KIRK,The Apple,We would like to speak to this Vaal.
KIRK,The Apple,Antennae?
KIRK,The Apple,You speak of the people of Vaal.
KIRK,The Apple,Are they nearby?
KIRK,The Apple,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Apple,"Scotty, are the warp drives still out?"
KIRK,The Apple,Put it on maximum.
KIRK,The Apple,Full emergency circuits.
KIRK,The Apple,"Status, are you still holding?"
KIRK,The Apple,Maintain full reverse thrust against the pull.
KIRK,The Apple,Put a team on that warp drive.
KIRK,The Apple,Get it working.
KIRK,The Apple,"Scotty, you're my Chief Engineer."
KIRK,The Apple,You know everything about that ship there is to know.
KIRK,The Apple,More than the men who designed it.
KIRK,The Apple,If you can't get those warp engines working
KIRK,The Apple,You're fired.
KIRK,The Apple,Tell me about Vaal.
KIRK,The Apple,Take me to him.
KIRK,The Apple,I wish to speak to him.
KIRK,The Apple,I'll take my chances.
KIRK,The Apple,"But this is not the centre, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Apple,A force field?
KIRK,The Apple,You all right?
KIRK,The Apple,"Akuta, how do you talk to Vaal?"
KIRK,The Apple,"Well, we can't get to it."
KIRK,The Apple,We can't talk to it unless it wants to talk to us.
KIRK,The Apple,When does he get hungry?
KIRK,The Apple,Where are the others?
KIRK,The Apple,The children.
KIRK,The Apple,Little ones like yourselves.
KIRK,The Apple,They grow.
KIRK,The Apple,"Well, thank you."
KIRK,The Apple,It does something for you.
KIRK,The Apple,Nothing makes sense down here.
KIRK,The Apple,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Apple,"Status report, Scotty."
KIRK,The Apple,I'm sick of hearing that word can't.
KIRK,The Apple,Get that ship out of there.
KIRK,The Apple,Then use your imagination.
KIRK,The Apple,Tie every ounce of power the ship has into the impulse engines.
KIRK,The Apple,"Discard the warp drive nacelles if you have to, and crack out of there with the main section, but get that ship out of there!"
KIRK,The Apple,Do it.
KIRK,The Apple,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Apple,Report.
KIRK,The Apple,I see.
KIRK,The Apple,Opinion.
KIRK,The Apple,"Add to that a simple diet, a perfectly controlled temperature, no natural enemies, apparently no vices, no replacements needed."
KIRK,The Apple,Maybe it is paradise after all.
KIRK,The Apple,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Apple,"Well, the field's down, people are going in."
KIRK,The Apple,Let's see what kind of luck we have.
KIRK,The Apple,That's not the way.
KIRK,The Apple,But it needs to eat.
KIRK,The Apple,Frequently.
KIRK,The Apple,So it can't have any great power reserves.
KIRK,The Apple,What happens if Vaal weakens around feeding time?
KIRK,The Apple,"Spock, check the electromagnetic section of the astrophysics lab."
KIRK,The Apple,Get an estimate of the total amount of energy being expended against the ship.
KIRK,The Apple,Have them measure it hour by hour.
KIRK,The Apple,Mess call.
KIRK,The Apple,"Gentlemen, I think this philosophical argument can wait until our ship's out of danger."
KIRK,The Apple,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Apple,"Did it maintain, Scotty?"
KIRK,The Apple,Good.
KIRK,The Apple,Keep monitoring.
KIRK,The Apple,How are you coming along with the circuit switchover?
KIRK,The Apple,"That's cutting it a bit fine, Scotty."
KIRK,The Apple,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Apple,"Yeoman, you're wasting energy."
KIRK,The Apple,"Sit down, and have something to eat."
KIRK,The Apple,That hasn't happened yet.
KIRK,The Apple,I wonder what would happen?
KIRK,The Apple,"Yeoman, speculate."
KIRK,The Apple,What would happen if someone on this planet died?
KIRK,The Apple,Accidents happen.
KIRK,The Apple,They'd need a replacement.
KIRK,The Apple,"Opinion, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Apple,Mister Spock?
KIRK,The Apple,You're the science officer.
KIRK,The Apple,Why don't you explain it to the young lady.
KIRK,The Apple,Bones was right.
KIRK,The Apple,"These people aren't living, they're existing."
KIRK,The Apple,"They don't create, they don't produce, they don't even think."
KIRK,The Apple,They exist to service a machine.
KIRK,The Apple,"These are people, not robots."
KIRK,The Apple,They should have the opportunity of choice.
KIRK,The Apple,We owe it to them to interfere.
KIRK,The Apple,I'll take my chances.
KIRK,The Apple,Why don't you have a look around?
KIRK,The Apple,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Apple,Mister Scott?
KIRK,The Apple,"How's it going, Scotty?"
KIRK,The Apple,"You realise that within forty five minutes, the ship will be pulled down into the atmosphere?"
KIRK,The Apple,"Yes, I"
KIRK,The Apple,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Apple,What is it?
KIRK,The Apple,"Vaal, we are on a peaceful mission."
KIRK,The Apple,We mean no harm to you or your people.
KIRK,The Apple,Let's get out of here!
KIRK,The Apple,Bones!
KIRK,The Apple,Marple!
KIRK,The Apple,Put them in the hut.
KIRK,The Apple,Find out where the women are.
KIRK,The Apple,"Put them in there, too."
KIRK,The Apple,"All right, Scotty, put her in full reverse."
KIRK,The Apple,Get her out of there.
KIRK,The Apple,"Scotty, what happened?"
KIRK,The Apple,You're fired.
KIRK,The Apple,Four hundred people
KIRK,The Apple,They'll die because I couldn't see a warning sign.
KIRK,The Apple,"I had to follow orders, always orders."
KIRK,The Apple,"Bones, that's it."
KIRK,The Apple,Stay with Chekov.
KIRK,The Apple,Keep those people from feeding Vaal.
KIRK,The Apple,Don't let them feed Vaal.
KIRK,The Apple,Keep them in the hut.
KIRK,The Apple,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Apple,"Scotty, do you still have phaser power?"
KIRK,The Apple,Lock all banks on the co-ordinates of the energy field located down here.
KIRK,The Apple,"If my guess is correct, they won't have to."
KIRK,The Apple,Stand by.
KIRK,The Apple,Good.
KIRK,The Apple,The ship's pulling away must have weakened it considerable.
KIRK,The Apple,"It has to be fed, but its reserve capacity could hold out for days."
KIRK,The Apple,My plan exactly.
KIRK,The Apple,Scotty.
KIRK,The Apple,"Scotty, commence firing and maintain."
KIRK,The Apple,Good.
KIRK,The Apple,Let's see how long he can do it.
KIRK,The Apple,"Scotty, cease fire."
KIRK,The Apple,"Mister Scott, status report."
KIRK,The Apple,"Scotty, you're re-hired."
KIRK,The Apple,"As soon as the transporter's fixed, form an engineering detail with full analytical equipment and beam them down."
KIRK,The Apple,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Apple,"Chekov, Bones."
KIRK,The Apple,Let those people go.
KIRK,The Apple,"You'll learn to care for yourselves, with our help."
KIRK,The Apple,And there's no trick to putting fruit on trees.
KIRK,The Apple,You might enjoy it.
KIRK,The Apple,"You'll learn to build for yourselves, think for yourselves, work for yourselves, and what you create is yours."
KIRK,The Apple,That's what we call freedom.
KIRK,The Apple,"You'll like it, a lot."
KIRK,The Apple,"And you'll learn something about men and women, the way they're supposed to be."
KIRK,The Apple,"Caring for each other, being happy with each other, being good to each other."
KIRK,The Apple,That's what we call love.
KIRK,The Apple,"You'll like that, too, a lot."
KIRK,The Apple,You and your children.
KIRK,The Apple,The little ones?
KIRK,The Apple,Look like you?
KIRK,The Apple,Just go on the way you're going.
KIRK,The Apple,You'll find out.
KIRK,The Apple,"Well, that's a good object lesson, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Apple,"It's an example of what can happen when a machine becomes too efficient, does too much work for you."
KIRK,The Apple,"Yes, of course I'm aware of it."
KIRK,The Apple,Adam and Eve tasted the apple and as a result were driven out of paradise.
KIRK,The Apple,"Doctor, do I understand him correctly?"
KIRK,The Apple,Are you casting me in the role of Satan?
KIRK,The Apple,Is there anyone on this ship who even remotely looks like Satan?
KIRK,The Apple,"No, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Apple,I didn't think you would be.
MCCOY,The Apple,"Well, I just might stake out a claim and settle down here, Jim."
MCCOY,The Apple,It's a shame to have to intrude.
MCCOY,The Apple,"More like the Garden of Eden, Ensign."
MCCOY,The Apple,Dead.
MCCOY,The Apple,"Jim, I don't like this."
MCCOY,The Apple,Some of the thorns like those that killed Hendorff.
MCCOY,The Apple,See the stuff on the end?
MCCOY,The Apple,"It's like saplin, only it's a thousand times stronger."
MCCOY,The Apple,"I filled him with enough masiform D to make the whole crew turn handsprings, and he's not responding."
MCCOY,The Apple,"Got to get him back to the ship, Jim."
MCCOY,The Apple,"If your blood were red instead of green, you wouldn't have an upset stomach."
MCCOY,The Apple,"Jim, you couldn't have stopped any of this."
MCCOY,The Apple,"Well, there goes paradise."
MCCOY,The Apple,Incredible.
MCCOY,The Apple,"I just ran a thorough check on the natives, and there's a complete lack of harmful bacteria in their systems, no decalcification, no degeneration of tissue, no arteriosclerosis."
MCCOY,The Apple,"In simple terms, Jim, they're not growing old, and I can't begin to tell you how old they are, twenty years or twenty thousand years."
MCCOY,The Apple,"What's going on, Jim?"
MCCOY,The Apple,It would take a computerised Vulcan mind such as yours to make that kind of a statement.
MCCOY,The Apple,"There are certain absolutes, Mister Spock, and one of them is the right of humanoids to a free and unchained environment, the right to have conditions which permit growth."
MCCOY,The Apple,"Jim, you're not just going to stand by and be blinded to what's going on here."
MCCOY,The Apple,"These are humanoids, intelligent."
MCCOY,The Apple,They need to advance and grow.
MCCOY,The Apple,Don't you understand what my readings indicate?
MCCOY,The Apple,There's been no progress here in at least ten thousand years.
MCCOY,The Apple,This isn't life.
MCCOY,The Apple,It's stagnation.
MCCOY,The Apple,"It might work for you, Mister Spock, but it doesn't work for me."
MCCOY,The Apple,Humanoids living so they can service a hunk of tin.
MCCOY,The Apple,From a machine?
MCCOY,The Apple,That I'd like to see.
MCCOY,The Apple,Second degree burns.
MCCOY,The Apple,"Not serious, but I'll bet they smart."
MCCOY,The Apple,Jim
MCCOY,The Apple,Fine time to ring the dinner bell.
MCCOY,The Apple,"I don't agree with you at all, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,The Apple,"Jim, I want you to hear this."
MCCOY,The Apple,We put those people back on a normal course of social evolution.
MCCOY,The Apple,I see nothing wrong in that.
SPOCK,The Apple,"The soil here is remarkably rich and fertile, Captain."
SPOCK,The Apple,Husbandry would be quite efficacious.
SPOCK,The Apple,"Oh, quite sure."
SPOCK,The Apple,Readings indicate the entire planet is covered with growth like this.
SPOCK,The Apple,"Curious, even at the poles there's very little variation in temperature which maintains a planet-wide average of seventy six degrees."
SPOCK,The Apple,"I find that most unusual, Captain."
SPOCK,The Apple,Indeed.
SPOCK,The Apple,Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions.
SPOCK,The Apple,"Quite strong, fairly regular, artificially produced."
SPOCK,The Apple,Captain.
SPOCK,The Apple,"There's a humanoid hiding directly behind us, moving with remarkable agility, bearing one eight."
SPOCK,The Apple,A visitor.
SPOCK,The Apple,"One wanting to retain his anonymity, I should say."
SPOCK,The Apple,Anything?
SPOCK,The Apple,Interesting.
SPOCK,The Apple,"Extremely low specific gravity, some uraninite, hornblende, quartz."
SPOCK,The Apple,"(breaks it in half) Fragile, good cleavage."
SPOCK,The Apple,An analysis should prove interesting.
SPOCK,The Apple,"Obviously highly unstable, Captain."
SPOCK,The Apple,This could be a find of some importance.
SPOCK,The Apple,"In large quantities, it could be a considerable source of power."
SPOCK,The Apple,"If Scott is correct about the force from the surface, it may have to do with the vibrations I read earlier."
SPOCK,The Apple,"If so, an immense one."
SPOCK,The Apple,Probably subterranean.
SPOCK,The Apple,(noticing a plant moving) Jim!
SPOCK,The Apple,"Doctor McCoy's potion is acting like all his potions, turning my stomach."
SPOCK,The Apple,"Other than that, I am quite well."
SPOCK,The Apple,"I surmised you were unaware of that plant, so I"
SPOCK,The Apple,"I assure you, Captain, I had no intention of doing that."
SPOCK,The Apple,It was merely my own clumsiness prevented me which prevented me from moving out of the way.
SPOCK,The Apple,I shall do so.
SPOCK,The Apple,One hundred twenty two thousand two hundred
SPOCK,The Apple,"Captain, to affect the ship at this extreme range would require a highly sophisticated planetary defence system."
SPOCK,The Apple,Captain.
SPOCK,The Apple,Those co-ordinates are a short distance in that direction.
SPOCK,The Apple,Captain.
SPOCK,The Apple,"In each case, this was unavoidable."
SPOCK,The Apple,I don't see how.
SPOCK,The Apple,You are under orders to investigate this planet and this culture.
SPOCK,The Apple,No one has ever stated that Starfleet duty was particularly safe.
SPOCK,The Apple,"You've followed the correct and logical course, done everything a commander could do."
SPOCK,The Apple,"Self-recriminations (he pauses) Captain, our friend is back."
SPOCK,The Apple,"Mister Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient!"
SPOCK,The Apple,"Ensign, I will not have you address me in that tone of voice!"
SPOCK,The Apple,"Captain, this is fascinating."
SPOCK,The Apple,"If you will permit me, sir?"
SPOCK,The Apple,Fascinating.
SPOCK,The Apple,"A very high order of workmanship, very ancient, generating great power."
SPOCK,The Apple,"No, Captain."
SPOCK,The Apple,The centre is deep in the earth beneath us.
SPOCK,The Apple,This is an access point.
SPOCK,The Apple,It would also seem to be a
SPOCK,The Apple,Obviously.
SPOCK,The Apple,"Yes, quite."
SPOCK,The Apple,It extends some thirty feet beyond the figure in all directions.
SPOCK,The Apple,"Conventional in composition, and quite formidable."
SPOCK,The Apple,"Yes, indeed it does, Captain."
SPOCK,The Apple,It makes me uncomfortable.
SPOCK,The Apple,Yes.
SPOCK,The Apple,Spock.
SPOCK,The Apple,I am Spock.
SPOCK,The Apple,I fail to see what they find so amusing.
SPOCK,The Apple,Quite possible.
SPOCK,The Apple,It checks with my atmospheric analysis.
SPOCK,The Apple,Their atmosphere completely negates any harmful effects from their sun.
SPOCK,The Apple,"Apparently, our hypothesis is correct."
SPOCK,The Apple,There is no living being there.
SPOCK,The Apple,"It is a machine, nothing more."
SPOCK,The Apple,Evidently not.
SPOCK,The Apple,"This is no ordinary machine, Captain."
SPOCK,The Apple,It may well possess a rudimentary intelligence.
SPOCK,The Apple,That may not be of any help.
SPOCK,The Apple,The Enterprise has only ten hours left in which to break free.
SPOCK,The Apple,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,The Apple,"In my view, a splendid example of reciprocity."
SPOCK,The Apple,"Doctor, you insist on applying human standards to non-human cultures."
SPOCK,The Apple,I remind you that humans are only a tiny minority in this galaxy.
SPOCK,The Apple,Another is their right to choose a system which seems to work for them.
SPOCK,The Apple,"Doctor, these people are healthy and they are happy."
SPOCK,The Apple,"What ever you choose to call it, this system works, despite your emotional reaction to it."
SPOCK,The Apple,I see no alternative.
SPOCK,The Apple,"Well, I believe it's safe, (cough) safe to assume that they would receive the necessary instructions."
SPOCK,The Apple,"I am concerned, Captain."
SPOCK,The Apple,"This may not be an ideal society, but it is a viable one."
SPOCK,The Apple,"If we do what it seems we must, in my opinion it will be in direct violation of the non-interference directive."
SPOCK,The Apple,Starfleet Command may think otherwise.
SPOCK,The Apple,Captain!
SPOCK,The Apple,Disturbing.
SPOCK,The Apple,The people of Vaal seem to have disappeared.
SPOCK,The Apple,"Force field, Captain."
SPOCK,The Apple,"Variation in impulses, Captain."
SPOCK,The Apple,I believe it is reading us.
SPOCK,The Apple,A strong jump on all wavelengths.
SPOCK,The Apple,"Doctor, you have an unsurpassed talent for understatement."
SPOCK,The Apple,The good doctor was concerned that the Vaalians achieved true human stature.
SPOCK,The Apple,I submit there is no cause for worry.
SPOCK,The Apple,They've taken the first step.
SPOCK,The Apple,They've learned to kill.
SPOCK,The Apple,"Readings are getting weaker, Captain."
SPOCK,The Apple,"Wide variation in energy transmissions, as though Vaal were trying to draw on other sources."
SPOCK,The Apple,KIRK: Tapping its energy cells.
SPOCK,The Apple,I would assume so.
SPOCK,The Apple,"If it had to reinforce its energy field to ward off a phaser attack, it would have to draw more heavily on its reserves."
SPOCK,The Apple,"A tremendous upsurge in generated power, Captain."
SPOCK,The Apple,Obviously Vaal is trying to reinforce his energy field.
SPOCK,The Apple,"No power generation at all, Captain."
SPOCK,The Apple,Vaal is dead.
SPOCK,The Apple,"That's not unusual, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Apple,"Captain, I'm not at all certain we did the correct thing on Gamma Trianguli Six."
SPOCK,The Apple,"Captain, you are aware of the biblical story of Genesis."
SPOCK,The Apple,"Precisely, Captain, and in a manner of speaking, we have given the people of Vaal the apple, the knowledge of good and evil if you will, as a result of which they too have been driven out of paradise."
SPOCK,The Apple,"Not at all, Captain."
SPOCK,The Apple,"I am not aware of anyone who fits that description, Captain."
CHEKOV,The Apple,It makes me homesick.
CHEKOV,The Apple,Just like Russia.
CHEKOV,The Apple,"Of course, Doctor."
CHEKOV,The Apple,The Garden of Eden was just outside Moscow.
CHEKOV,The Apple,A very nice place.
CHEKOV,The Apple,It must have made Adam and Eve very sad to leave.
CHEKOV,The Apple,"What is it, Mister Spock?"
CHEKOV,The Apple,"If you insist on worrying, worry about me."
CHEKOV,The Apple,I've been wanting to get you in a place like this for a long time.
CHEKOV,The Apple,I was about to take some readings.
CHEKOV,The Apple,"Mind your own business, sir!"
CHEKOV,The Apple,"For your information, I have a very high efficiency rating."
CHEKOV,The Apple,"What do you want, violence?"
CHEKOV,The Apple,Now we're welcome.
CHEKOV,The Apple,A while ago this whole planet was trying to kill us.
CHEKOV,The Apple,It doesn't make sense.
CHEKOV,The Apple,Any place we can be together is paradise.
CHEKOV,The Apple,I don't know.
CHEKOV,The Apple,"Martha, I don't know."
CHEKOV,The Apple,"But if we do have to stay here, would it be so very bad?"
CHEKOV,The Apple,Get back in there.
CHEKOV,The Apple,Get back in there.
CHEKOV,The Apple,Now!
HENDORFF,The Apple,Captain.
SCOTT,The Apple,"Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,The Apple,It's a shame about Hendorff.
SCOTT,The Apple,"We seem to have a problem here, too."
SCOTT,The Apple,We're losing potency in our antimatter pods.
SCOTT,The Apple,"I don't think it's serious, but we're looking into it."
SCOTT,The Apple,"I'm not sure, sir, but we've run measurements on the electromagnetic field of the planet, and they are a wee bit abnormal."
SCOTT,The Apple,That might have something to do with it.
SCOTT,The Apple,"Well, sir, I didn't exactly say that."
SCOTT,The Apple,I hear it's nice down there.
SCOTT,The Apple,I could do with a nice walk in a garden with green leaves and grass.
SCOTT,The Apple,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,The Apple,"Scott, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,Our antimatter pods are completely inert.
SCOTT,The Apple,"I couldn't stop it, but I know why."
SCOTT,The Apple,Something from the surface.
SCOTT,The Apple,It's like a pail of water on a fire.
SCOTT,The Apple,"A beam, maybe, or a transmission."
SCOTT,The Apple,And it's still on.
SCOTT,The Apple,"I'm having it analysed, but it's like nothing I've seen before."
SCOTT,The Apple,And it's pinpointed in the area of that village we located down there.
SCOTT,The Apple,"There's nothing you can do about it, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,There doesn't seem to be any immediate danger.
SCOTT,The Apple,"Scott here, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,"Aye, aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,"Transporter room, stand by to beam up landing party."
SCOTT,The Apple,"Standing by, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,Energise.
SCOTT,The Apple,"We can't make transporter contact, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,The entire system's inhibited.
SCOTT,The Apple,"The way it is now, we couldn't beam up a fly."
SCOTT,The Apple,"I don't know, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,I'll check it and get back with you.
SCOTT,The Apple,Scott out.
SCOTT,The Apple,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,The Apple,Condition red.
SCOTT,The Apple,Condition red.
SCOTT,The Apple,"Captain, something has grabbed us from the planet surface"
SCOTT,The Apple,"Like a giant tractor beam, and we can't break loose."
SCOTT,The Apple,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,All we have is impulse power.
SCOTT,The Apple,"They're all on, Captain."
SCOTT,The Apple,Kyle?
SCOTT,The Apple,"Computer banks, Kyle."
SCOTT,The Apple,"Feed in a rate, get me a figure."
SCOTT,The Apple,"We might be able to pull out with warp drive, but without it"
SCOTT,The Apple,We're like a fly on fly paper.
SCOTT,The Apple,Even worse
SCOTT,The Apple,We're starting to lose ground.
SCOTT,The Apple,"Hurry up on that figure, Kyle."
SCOTT,The Apple,"I've done that, Captain."
SCOTT,The Apple,They haven't been able to do a thing.
SCOTT,The Apple,"(Kyle hands him a PADD) It's no good, Captain."
SCOTT,The Apple,With maximum thrust against the pull
SCOTT,The Apple,"We'll only be able to maintain full power for sixteen hours, then we burn up for sure."
SCOTT,The Apple,"I'll do everything there is to do, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,Scott out.
SCOTT,The Apple,Scott here.
SCOTT,The Apple,"No change, Captain."
SCOTT,The Apple,The orbit is decaying along computed lines.
SCOTT,The Apple,No success with the warp drive.
SCOTT,The Apple,We're going down and we can't stop it.
SCOTT,The Apple,"Sir, we're doing everything within engineering reason."
SCOTT,The Apple,"Sir, I'm going to switch over everything but the life-support systems and boost the impulse power, but that's just about as dangerous."
SCOTT,The Apple,"Scotty, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,We have a reading on the power source Mister Spock requested.
SCOTT,The Apple,"When we first monitored, it was generating alternating cycles totalling one hundred to the twentieth power Waltham units."
SCOTT,The Apple,"No, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,Power's dropping bit by bit.
SCOTT,The Apple,"Nominal, but a definite drain."
SCOTT,The Apple,"We're putting everything but the kitchen sink into impulse power, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,It will take us another eight hours to complete the work.
SCOTT,The Apple,"Aye, but if we don't break out, I'd rather we didn't have to wait too long for the end of it."
SCOTT,The Apple,"Here, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,"Almost ready, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,We need half an hour yet.
SCOTT,The Apple,I know that.
SCOTT,The Apple,"As you said, that's cutting things fine."
SCOTT,The Apple,"We're ready here, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,All available power has been channelled into the impulse engines.
SCOTT,The Apple,We have twelve minutes before entering atmosphere.
SCOTT,The Apple,"Full reverse, Mister Kyle, all engines."
SCOTT,The Apple,"Captain, we're doing it."
SCOTT,The Apple,We're pulling away!
SCOTT,The Apple,"Captain, we've pulled away a little."
SCOTT,The Apple,"We gained maybe an hour, but we blew almost every system in the ship doing it."
SCOTT,The Apple,There's nothing left to try again.
SCOTT,The Apple,"I guess you'll have to fire me, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,"Aye, but what"
SCOTT,The Apple,"Aye, sir, but they won't penetrate that force field."
SCOTT,The Apple,"Scott here, sir."
SCOTT,The Apple,"Mister Kyle, all phasers commence firing."
SCOTT,The Apple,Tractor beam gone.
SCOTT,The Apple,Potency returning to antimatter pods.
SCOTT,The Apple,I'll have all engineering sections working on the circuits immediately.
SCOTT,The Apple,Transporter'll be ready in an hour.
MALLORY,The Apple,"Yes, Captain?"
MALLORY,The Apple,"Aye, aye, sir."
MALLORY,The Apple,"Mallory here, Captain."
MALLORY,The Apple,I'm near the village.
MALLORY,The Apple,"Co-ordinates, one one eight by two two zero."
MALLORY,The Apple,The village is primitive.
MALLORY,The Apple,Strictly tribal from the looks of it.
MALLORY,The Apple,"And Captain, there's something else."
MALLORY,The Apple,"Captain, come in."
MALLORY,The Apple,It's over there!
MALLORY,The Apple,That way!
MALLORY,The Apple,I never saw anything like
MARTHA,The Apple,"All this beauty, and now Mister Hendorff dead, somebody watching us."
MARTHA,The Apple,It's frightening.
MARTHA,The Apple,"But when a man and woman fall in love,"
MARTHA,The Apple,Love is when two people are
MARTHA,The Apple,Every time I think of the Enterprise burning up and us
MARTHA,The Apple,"Captain, we're trapped,"
MARTHA,The Apple,The Enterprise is up there
MARTHA,The Apple,But they can't.
MARTHA,The Apple,You said that Vaal takes care of them.
MARTHA,The Apple,"Yes, I suppose if someone were to fall off a cliff or something, that might upset the balance of the population."
MARTHA,The Apple,Then they would need a replacement.
MARTHA,The Apple,"But these people, I mean, if they don't know anything about."
MARTHA,The Apple,"What I mean is, they don't seem to have any natural er."
MARTHA,The Apple,"I mean, how is it, done?"
MARTHA,The Apple,"You know, if it weren't for Vaal this place would be a paradise."
MARTHA,The Apple,"Pav, can the ship really break away?"
MARTHA,The Apple,Will we be able to get back aboard?
MARTHA,The Apple,"No, not if you're with me."
KAPLAN,The Apple,"Yes, sir."
AKUTA,The Apple,You struck me.
AKUTA,The Apple,With your hand.
AKUTA,The Apple,I am the eyes of Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,He must see.
AKUTA,The Apple,Vaal is Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,He is everything.
AKUTA,The Apple,I am Akuta.
AKUTA,The Apple,I am the leader of the feeders of Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,Akuta alone speaks to Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,I am the eyes and the voice of Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,It is Vaal's wish.
AKUTA,The Apple,They are my ears for Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,They were given to me in the dim time so the people could understand his commands and obey.
AKUTA,The Apple,We are close to Vaal so we may serve him.
AKUTA,The Apple,I shall take you there.
AKUTA,The Apple,All the world knows about Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,He causes the rains to fall and the sun to shine.
AKUTA,The Apple,All good comes from Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,"I shall take you to him, but he will not speak to you."
AKUTA,The Apple,He speaks only to me.
AKUTA,The Apple,Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,Vaal calls me.
AKUTA,The Apple,Only then.
AKUTA,The Apple,Vaal sleeps now.
AKUTA,The Apple,"When he is hungry, you may be able to speak with him, if he desires it."
AKUTA,The Apple,Soon.
AKUTA,The Apple,Come.
AKUTA,The Apple,We will give you food and drink.
AKUTA,The Apple,"If you are tired, you may rest."
AKUTA,The Apple,These are the people of Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,There are no others.
AKUTA,The Apple,Children?
AKUTA,The Apple,You use unknown words to me.
AKUTA,The Apple,Replacements.
AKUTA,The Apple,None are necessary.
AKUTA,The Apple,They are forbidden by Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,Love.
AKUTA,The Apple,Strange words.
AKUTA,The Apple,Children.
AKUTA,The Apple,Love.
AKUTA,The Apple,What is love?
AKUTA,The Apple,"Ah, yes."
AKUTA,The Apple,"The holding, the touching."
AKUTA,The Apple,Vaal has forbidden this.
AKUTA,The Apple,"These people, are from another place."
AKUTA,The Apple,They have come among us.
AKUTA,The Apple,Welcome them!
AKUTA,The Apple,Come!
AKUTA,The Apple,This house is your house.
AKUTA,The Apple,I will send you more food and drink.
AKUTA,The Apple,You are welcome in the place of Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,"I understand, Vaal."
AKUTA,The Apple,It shall be done.
AKUTA,The Apple,The law is plain.
AKUTA,The Apple,I have given you the words of Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,Do you beg the lightning to strike?
AKUTA,The Apple,You copied them?
AKUTA,The Apple,Vaal speaks truly to me.
AKUTA,The Apple,The newcomers are a danger.
AKUTA,The Apple,Tell the men of Vaal to meet me in the clear place when the strangers are asleep.
AKUTA,The Apple,It is Vaal's own words.
AKUTA,The Apple,(The men are waiting for Akuta.
AKUTA,The Apple,He arrives with a blue melon and a very big stick.
AKUTA,The Apple,Vaal has spoken to me.
AKUTA,The Apple,His words are true.
AKUTA,The Apple,Hear them.
AKUTA,The Apple,We are to kill the strangers.
AKUTA,The Apple,"It is a thing to do, like, like feeding Vaal."
AKUTA,The Apple,Vaal explained it to me.
AKUTA,The Apple,I will show you.
AKUTA,The Apple,This (the melon) is the head of one of the strangers.
AKUTA,The Apple,Find a heavy stick.
AKUTA,The Apple,Come up from behind the stranger and do this.
AKUTA,The Apple,It is a simple thing.
AKUTA,The Apple,It is the word of Vaal.
AKUTA,The Apple,It will be done to all of them when the sun returns in the morning.
AKUTA,The Apple,Vaal calls to us.
AKUTA,The Apple,Let us go to him.
AKUTA,The Apple,He hungers.
AKUTA,The Apple,Please.
AKUTA,The Apple,"But it was Vaal who put the fruit on the trees, caused the rain to fall."
AKUTA,The Apple,Vaal cared for us.
KYLE,The Apple,"It's no use, Mister Scott."
KYLE,The Apple,We're just barely holding our own.
KYLE,The Apple,"No, sir."
KYLE,The Apple,We're slipping.
KYLE,The Apple,Sir!
KYLE,The Apple,"It's no good, sir."
KYLE,The Apple,There's only a few systems responding.
ALL,The Apple,Welcome to Vaal.
SAYANA,The Apple,(placing the equivalent of a lei around Kirk's wrist.)
SAYANA,The Apple,Our homes are open to you.
SAYANA,The Apple,I am Sayana.
SAYANA,The Apple,You have a name?
SAYANA,The Apple,(amid general merriment) Spock?
SAYANA,The Apple,Why do you look like that?
SAYANA,The Apple,They were not angry.
SAYANA,The Apple,I think it was pleasant for them.
SAYANA,The Apple,"It is pleasant, Makora."
SAYANA,The Apple,"We saw the strangers, the two of them, do this thing."
SAYANA,The Apple,What are children?
MAKORA,The Apple,The way they touched.
MAKORA,The Apple,I do not understand.
MAKORA,The Apple,But what is to be gained?
MAKORA,The Apple,It is not a dance.
MAKORA,The Apple,It gathers no food.
MAKORA,The Apple,It does not serve Vaal.
MAKORA,The Apple,"But it did seem as though it was, pleasant to them."
MAKORA,The Apple,Yes.
MAKORA,The Apple,They touched in this way.
MAKORA,The Apple,Vaal!
MAKORA,The Apple,He is angry.
MAKORA,The Apple,We meant no harm.
MAKORA,The Apple,"Kill, Akuta?"
MAKORA,The Apple,We do not understand.
THARN,"Mirror,
Mirror","We believe what you say, Captain Kirk, but our position has not
altered."
THARN,"Mirror,
Mirror","The Halkan Council cannot permit your Federation to mine
dilithium crystals on our planet."
THARN,"Mirror,
Mirror","We accept that your Federation is benevolent at present, but the
future is always in question."
THARN,"Mirror,
Mirror","Our dilithium crystals represent awesome
power."
THARN,"Mirror,
Mirror","Wrongful use of that power, even to the extent of the taking of
one life, would violate our history of total peace."
THARN,"Mirror,
Mirror","To prevent that, we
would die, Captain."
THARN,"Mirror,
Mirror","As a race, if necessary."
THARN,"Mirror,
Mirror","The council will meditate further, but do not be hopeful of any
change."
THARN,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, you do have the might to force the crystals from us,
of course."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","We have shown the council historical proof that our missions are
peaceful."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I admire your ethics and hope to prove ours.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Report on magnetic storm, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Rough ride?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Stand by to beam up landing party.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Plot an extended orbit to clear
disturbance."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Kirk out.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",When may we resume discussion?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",But we won't.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Consider that.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Enterprise.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Transporter room,
energise."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Spock was right.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",It was a rough trip.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",No change.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",None.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Yes.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Doctor McCoy, you'd better look us over."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","That was a rough
beam-up."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Mister Spock, have those transporter circuits checked."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Not now.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Not now.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I don't know.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",It's our Enterprise but it isn't.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Maybe
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Any of you feel dizzy when we were in the transporter beam?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",When we first materialised.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",It happened twice.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","First we were in our own transporter chamber,
then we faded, and then when we finally materialised, we were here."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Wherever this is.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Yes, here."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Not our universe, not our ship."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Something parallel.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","A
parallel universe co-existing with ours on another dimensional plane."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Everything's duplicated, almost."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Another Enterprise.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Spock with a
beard."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Then our counterparts must have been transporting up at the exact
same time."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Similar storms on both universes disrupted the circuits.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","We're here, and they're on our Enterprise."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Probably asking the same
questions."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Are we in another universe, and if so, how do we get back to
our own?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","They'll use the computer, and we have to."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Scotty, can you buy me some time."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Get below and short out the
main phaser couplings."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","They'll think the storm blew the stand-by
circuits."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Then get on this technology.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","It's all we have to work with if we
want to get back home."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",The intercom may be monitored.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Use your
communicators for private messages."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Subfrequency and scramble.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Lieutenant.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Get to your post.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Run today's communication from Starfleet
Command."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I want to know my exact orders and options, if any."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Bones.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Uhura, you're the only one who can do it."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I'll be right there.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Bones.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Let's take a look at the library.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",We have a lot to learn.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Communications status.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Stand by, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Very good.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Thank you, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Kirk out.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",No.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Lieutenant Uhura, contact the Halkan council."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I wish to talk to
them again."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",This is a new race.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","They offer other things of value besides
dilithium crystals."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Put phasers on standby, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I have my reasons, and I'll make them clear to you in my own good
time."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",It is useless to resist us.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You have twelve hours to consider your position.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",We will level your planet and take what we want.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","That is
destruction."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You will die as a race.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",We will not argue.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Twelve hours.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",No more.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Close communications.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Turn phasers off.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I shall be in my quarters.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Lieutenant Uhura, have Doctor McCoy
and Mister Scott meet me there."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","You're at liberty to do so, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Yes, he did your job."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Get him out of here.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",All right.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You're working for me.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You're in line.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You might even make captain.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Not on my ship.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Yes, the booth."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Carry on.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",It's called blood.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Watch your step.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","The officers move up by
assassination."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Chekov tried it on me.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Report on technology.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Star readings?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Let's find out where we stand.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Computer.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",This is the Captain.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Record security research, to be classified
under my voice print or Mister Scott's."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Produce all data relevant to the recent ion storm.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Correlate
following hypothesis."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Could a storm of such magnitude cause a power
surge in the transporter circuits creating a momentary interdimensional
contact with a parallel universe?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","At such a moment, could persons in each universe, in the act of
beaming, transpose with their counterparts in the other universe?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Could conditions necessary to such an event be created
artificially using the ship's power?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Record procedure.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Scotty, can you do it?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Let's find out.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Computer.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Read out official record of current command.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Cancel.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Now we know.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Good.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'll tell Uhura to create a diversion to distract Sulu, at your
signal."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Let's get back to our posts.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Keep me advised.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",On our Enterprise.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Why?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Logical, as always, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I haven't decided.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I said I haven't decided.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You heard my orders.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Is that a threat?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Spock, do you think we should destroy the Halkans?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Conquest is easy, control is not."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","We may have bitten off more
than we can chew."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Is my concern, not yours."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You would find me a formidable enemy.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Release Chekov.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Confine him to quarters.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","He gambled, I won."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I was preoccupied.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Further than that, if I'm successful."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Yes.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Yes, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",And if I don't?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I don't intend to kill him.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","No, but I'll avoid killing Spock."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I'll get out of his way.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Yes.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",It's not that bad.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Well, if you don't take advantage of your opportunities"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'll see to it that the circumstances of his failure will clear
him."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",How does Marlena want to fit in?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Scotty.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","We have to get out of here within three
hours."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Spock has orders to kill me unless I complete the mission.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Explain.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",How fast?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",If we miss?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",All right.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I'll be in the transporter room in ten minutes.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'll
meet you in Sickbay afterward."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I've never seen perfection, but no woman could come closer to it."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I still do.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I've got to go.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You don't have to do that.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You could.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",(She turns to slap him.)
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I simply meant that you could
be anything you want to be."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You're the Captain's woman until he says you're not.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Uhura?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Scotty's signal should be coming through any moment.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","You know
what to do."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Keep Sulu's attention off that board.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Good luck.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Kirk out.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",What are you doing?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Are you going to shoot me now, Spock?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I
thought I had until dawn."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Shoot.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You're wasting time.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","You're running a big risk, Spock."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","How much time, Scotty?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Everything laid in, Scotty?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","The time lag so the operator can get
into the transporter chamber?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","He is very much like our own Mister Spock, isn't he?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","You've got
that minute."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","What is this, Mister Sulu?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Let's go, Bones."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",No longer.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",A friend.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Activate the transporter.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","You saved us back at Sickbay
with the Tantalus field."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I can't.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I'm sorry.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Our power is balanced for four.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","There's no
guarantee that we'll make it with five."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",All could die.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Scotty?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",One is coming.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'd help you if I could, Marlena."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Believe that.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","If you kill us, you'll still stay."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Where's McCoy?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Time, Scotty."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Auxiliary.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Can you bridge to your setup?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",One of us will have to stay.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Get to the transporter chamber.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","You, too, Uhura."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","That's an order, Scotty."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",McCoy.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","You're a man of integrity in both universes, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",In that time I have something to say.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","How long before the Halkan
prediction of galactic revolt is realised?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",The inevitable outcome?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","The illogic of waste, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","The waste of lives,
potential, resources, time."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I submit to you that your Empire is
illogical because it cannot endure."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I submit that you are illogical to
be a willing part of it."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","If change is inevitable, predictable, beneficial, doesn't logic
demand that you be a part of it?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",But one man can change the present.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Be the captain of this
Enterprise, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Find a logical reason for sparing the Halkans
and make it stick."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Push till it gives.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","You can defend yourself better
than any man in the fleet."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","What about it, Spock?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",In my cabin is a device that will make you invincible.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",What will it be?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Past or future?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Tyranny or freedom?
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","It's up to
you."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","In every revolution, there's one man with a vision."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Spock.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","What I don't understand is how were you able
to identify our counterparts so quickly?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Probably.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","However, that Jim Kirk will find a few changes, if I
read my Spocks correctly."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","What worries me is the easy way his counterpart fitted into that
other universe."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I always thought Spock was a bit of a pirate at heart.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'm not sure, but I think we've been insulted."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Lieutenant, er, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","All right, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Carry on.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Uh, why do you ask?"
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Oh, no."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","No, no."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","We haven't met before, exactly."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror","She just seemed a
nice, likable girl."
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I think we could become friends.
KIRK,"Mirror,
Mirror",It's possible.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Spock here.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Standard ion type, Captain, but quite
violent (Enterprise shakes) and unpredictable."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",If we stay.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Comply, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","At norm, Mister Kyle."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Controls at neutral.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Status of mission, Captain?"
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Standard procedure, Captain?"
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","(Kirk nods) Mister Sulu, you will
programme phaser barrage on Halkan cities."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Their military capability, Captain?"
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Regrettable that this society has chosen suicide.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Mister Kyle,
you were instructed to compensate during the ion storm."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Carelessness with the equipment cannot be tolerated.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Your agoniser.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Your agoniser, please."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Mister Scott, the storm has caused some
minor damage in your section."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","There are also injuries requiring your
attention, Doctor."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Well, gentlemen?"
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Yes.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Due to your error, Mister Kyle?"
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Possibly a result of the severe storm.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, do you feel any
abnormal effects?"
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Planet's rotation is carrying primary target beyond arc of
phaser lock."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Lock on to secondary city.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Captain?
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",But we cannot expect their co-operation.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","They have refused the
Empire."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Command procedure dictates that we provide the customary
example."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","A serious breach of orders, Captain."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Twelve hours, Captain?"
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",That is unprecedented.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, you've placed yourself in a most grave position."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","This
conduct must be reported."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I think not.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Your authority on this ship is extremely limited,
Captain."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","The four of you will remain her in the Brig and in custody
until I discover how to return you to wherever it is you belong."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I can answer none of your questions at this time.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Apparently some kind of transposition has taken place.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I find it
extremely interesting."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, I am pleased that you frustrated
Mister Chekov's plan."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I should regret your death.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I do not desire the captaincy.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I much prefer my scientific
duties."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I am frankly content to be a lesser target.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",The agony booth is a most effective means of discipline.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I
presume you've ordered full duration."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Indeed.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",His act warrants death.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","That is, of course, your affair."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, may I inquire if you
intend to persist in your unusual course of action regarding the
Halkans?"
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","They are, of course, in contradiction to standard Empire
procedure."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You cannot ignore the consequences.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I do not threaten, Captain."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I merely state facts.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I have found
you to be an excellent officer."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Our missions together have been both
successful and profitable."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","However, I shall not permit your aberrations
to jeopardise my position."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Terror must be maintained or the Empire is doomed.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","It is the
logic of history."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, I do not wish to find myself opposing you, but if you
continue on your present course, this confusing, inexplicable
behaviour,"
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'm aware of that, Captain."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I trust that you are aware of the
reverse."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Mister Spock, Captain."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I have received a private communication from Starfleet Command.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I am committing a breach of regulations by informing you of its
contents."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I am instructed to wait until planet dawn
over principal target to permit you to carry out our mission."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","In that event, I am ordered to kill you and
to proceed against the Halkans as the new captain of the Enterprise."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Computer?
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Explain computer activity in the engineering section.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Who is conducting the research?
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",What is the nature of the research?
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Why are you monitoring my communications, Mister Sulu?"
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",That is my concern.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","If I am successful, you see yourself a step
nearer to the captaincy."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I do not want to command the Enterprise, but
if it should befall me, I suggest you remember that my operatives would
avenge my death and some of them are Vulcans."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Please restrict your movements, Captain."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I shall make that decision.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Since your return from the planet,
you've behaved in a most atypical and illogical manner."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I want to know
why."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I shall not waste time with you.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","You're too inflexible, too
disciplined once you've made up your mind."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","But Doctor McCoy has a
plenitude of human weaknesses, sentimental, soft."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","You may not tell me
what I want to know, but he will."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I have the phaser, Captain, and I do not intend to simply
disappear as so many of your opponents have in the past."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",If you please.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Sickbay.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Yes, of course."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",The entire landing party.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, stand over there."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Doctor, it is time for answers."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","(sitting up and grabbing McCoy's arm) Why did the captain let me
live?"
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Our minds are merging, Doctor."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Our minds are one.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I feel what
you feel."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I know what you know.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I cut the transporter power.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","It was necessary to delay your
beam-out until I could arrive."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Take him.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Engineering, re-activate main transporter circuits."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You must return to your universe.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",I must have my captain back.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I
shall operate the transporter."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You have two minutes and ten seconds.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Approximately two hundred and forty years.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","The Empire shall be overthrown, of course."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",You have one minute and twenty three seconds.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",One man cannot summon the future.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",A man must also have the power.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",Indeed?
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror",It is time.
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain Kirk, I shall consider it."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Welcome home, Captain."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","It was far easier for you as civilised men to behave like
barbarians, than it was for them as barbarians to behave like civilised men."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I assume
they returned to their Enterprise at the same time you appeared here."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Indeed, gentlemen."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","May I point out that I had an opportunity to
observe your counterparts here quite closely."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","They were brutal, savage,
unprincipled, uncivilised, treacherous, In every way, splendid examples
of homo sapiens, the very flower of humanity."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","I found them quite
refreshing."
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","You've met her before, Captain?"
SPOCK,"Mirror,
Mirror","Your reaction, One of recognition."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","Aye, sir."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","Yes, Mister Spock."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","Mister Chekov, phaser setting for planetary
target A."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",Port batteries locked.
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","Still no interest, Uhura?"
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",Hmm?
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",I could change your mind.
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",Is the captain here?
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",Is Spock here?
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",When the cat's away
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","Phasers Locked on target A, Captain."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",Approaching optimum range.
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","Commence fire, Captain?"
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",Captain?
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",Shall I correct orbit to new firing position?
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","Aye, sir."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",Secondary target now moving beyond our phaser lock.
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","Aye, sir."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","My security board has detected extensive use
of computer, Mister Spock."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",I was about to inform you.
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","It's not hard to guess the nature of
your order from Starfleet Command."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",I suggest a connection.
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","The captain
suspects."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",He's working on escape or defence.
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",Correct.
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",It's your play.
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","I hope you succeed,
because the order would fall on me next and you know how Captain Kirk's
enemies have a habit of disappearing."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","(wrapping his arms around her naked waist) Now you're making
sense."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror",Any time's a good time.
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","You take a lot of chances, Lieutenant."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","Mister Spock has orders to kill you, Captain."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","He will succeed,
apparently."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","You will also appear to have killed him after a fierce
battle."
SULU,"Mirror,
Mirror","Regrettable, but it will leave me in command."
KYLE,"Mirror,
Mirror","Trouble, sir."
KYLE,"Mirror,
Mirror","Yes, sir."
KYLE,"Mirror,
Mirror","But I tried, Mister Spock, I tried."
KYLE,"Mirror,
Mirror","But Mister Spock, I"
KYLE,"Mirror,
Mirror","No, Mister Spock."
KYLE,"Mirror,
Mirror","No, Mister Spock!"
KYLE,"Mirror,
Mirror",I tried.
KYLE,"Mirror,
Mirror",I really tried.
KYLE,"Mirror,
Mirror",Mister Spock.
KYLE,"Mirror,
Mirror","The power beam jumped for a moment, sir, as the landing party was
about to materialise."
KYLE,"Mirror,
Mirror",I never saw it happen before.
KYLE,"Mirror,
Mirror","No, Mister Spock."
KYLE,"Mirror,
Mirror",Before.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","Yes, sir."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",What is this?
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","Everything's all messed up and
changed around, out of place."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","No, not everything."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","That spot, I spilt acid there a year ago."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","Jim, What in blazes is this?"
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",An exchange.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",If we're here
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",What about the Halkans?
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",We can't let them be destroyed.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",Here.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",Here.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",What's this?
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",And my Sickbay is a chamber of horrors.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","My assistants were
betting on the tolerance of an injured man."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","How long it would take him
to pass out from the pain."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'm a doctor, not an engineer."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","Jim, the way this ship is run, what kind of people are we in
this universe?"
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","Jim, if we're here, what do you suppose our counterparts doing
back in our universe?"
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",That ought to hold him for about six hours.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",Now it's up to the captain.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",Help me get him on the table.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","Well, come on."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","Help me get him on
the table."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",He'll die without immediate treatment.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",We'll get home.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",This won't take long.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",Shut up?
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",I can save his life.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","Do you want me to stop, Jim?"
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","It'll only take
a minute."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","A little time, he'll live."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","I can't let him die, Jim."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",You get on to the transporter room.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",I'll be there in five minutes.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",I guarantee it.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","Now, go on, please."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","Jim, I think I liked him with a beard better."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror","It gave him
character."
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",Of course almost any change would be a distinct improvement.
MCCOY,"Mirror,
Mirror",I'm sure.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, what is all this?"
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",Aye.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",I did.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, the transporter chief mentioned a surge of power."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","The
transporter lock might have been affected by the ion storm and we just
materialised somewhere else."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","I've been ordered to check phaser couplings for possible damage
by the storm."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",Captain's orders.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",Never mind.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",I'll attend to it.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Phaser report, sir."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",No damage.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Mister Sulu is Security Chief, like the ancient Gestapo."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",Mostly variations in instrumentation.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",Nothing I can't handle.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Everything's exactly where it should be, except us."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",Not by myself.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",I'll need help.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",And you'd be too conspicuous.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",Now you're an engineer.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'll have to tap the power we need from
the warp engines and balance it for the four of us."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",Captain?
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",We can do it.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","We have to lay in the automatic transporter setting, but when we
interrupt engine circuits to tie the power increase into the
transporter, it'll show up on Sulu's security board."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Of course, we'll
only need a second."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Scotty here, sir."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","We've got another deadline, too, sir."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","The two-way matter transmission affected the local field density
between the universes, and it's increasing."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",We've got to move fast.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",Half hour at the most.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",We couldn't get out of here in a century.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","We're ready to
bridge power from the engines to the transporter."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","You've got to get down there and free the
board so we can lock in."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",Give me about ten minutes.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","I've got to complete a few more
computations."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Hardly fifteen minutes, sir."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","The field density between the two
universes is starting to close very fast."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","All laid in, sir."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Come on, McCoy!"
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","We're taking a chance of not
getting back home."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",Fourteen minutes.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",We've got to go!
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, we've barely got ten minutes."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","It's working, sir."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Five minutes, sir."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","The power's cut, sir."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",They're on to us.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Aye, it's available."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","I can get us the power, but the automatic setting is linked to
the transporter main."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","If we bypass, that means that someone has got to
operate the controls manually."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'll stay, Captain."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror",Jim.
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, get in the chamber!"
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror",How did we get in these
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, what's happened?"
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Maybe what, Captain?"
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Yes.
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Another Captain Kirk, another Doctor McCoy, another"
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, I'm"
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","You are away from your post, Mister."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","No storm damage, sir."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror",All stations report normal.
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","(quietly)
You're ordered to annihilate the Halkans unless they comply."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","No
alternative."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Captain, I have the leader on the Halkan Council waiting on
channel B."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Yes, Captain."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","I've got a pretty good idea, sir."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'll do my best, sir."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","You aren't very persistent, Mister Sulu."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","The
game has rules."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror",You're ignoring them.
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror",I protest and you come back.
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","You
didn't come back."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror",I was getting bored.
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Of course this isn't the time.
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror",I'm afraid I changed my mind.
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Again.
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","(drawing her dagger) So do you, Mister."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror",So do you.
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Take over for
me."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Mister Scott, all clear."
UHURA,"Mirror,
Mirror","On my way to
Sickbay."
CHEKOV,"Mirror,
Mirror","Co-ordinates seven one two stroke four, Mister Sulu."
CHEKOV,"Mirror,
Mirror","Deck five, sir?"
CHEKOV,"Mirror,
Mirror","(holding a phaser on Kirk) So you die,
Captain, and we all move up in rank."
CHEKOV,"Mirror,
Mirror","No one will question the
assassination of a captain who has disobeyed prime orders of the
Empire."
GUARD,"Mirror,
Mirror","Do you have authorisation from security, sir?"
GUARD,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'll have to check with Security Chief Sulu, sir."
MAN,"Mirror,
Mirror","Your men, Captain."
MAN,"Mirror,
Mirror","Easy, Farrell."
MAN,"Mirror,
Mirror",I did your job.
MAN,"Mirror,
Mirror",Ask the captain.
MAN,"Mirror,
Mirror",Mister Chekov was going to make me a chief.
MAN,"Mirror,
Mirror","You could make me an
officer."
MAN,"Mirror,

MAN,"Mirror,

MARLENA,"Mirror,

MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","We had quite a time in the chem lab picking up
after the storm."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Nothing compared to your day, I gather."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","I heard about
Chekov."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",You got lucky.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'm surprised you could be caught off-guard
that way."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",You're still in trouble with Starfleet Command.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","What you've
got in mind this time is beyond me."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","You're scheming, of course."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","The
Halkans have something you want, or, is it all some clever means to
advance you to the Admiralty?"
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Kirk.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",The Cabinet itself?
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Really?
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Well, you must know what you're doing."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",You always do.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","If I'm to be the woman of a Caesar, can't I know what you're up to?"
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Let's drink a toast to Spock, The only man
aboard with the decency to warn you, and he'll die for it."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","They'll
never find another man like him."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Are you going to act against the Halkans before the deadline?
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Just get him out of the way, he and his men."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Shall I activate the Tantalus field?
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","You'll at least want to
monitor him, won't you?"
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",I hate this thing.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Of course not.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",It made you captain.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","How many enemies have you
simply wiped out of existence by the touch of a button?"
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Fifty?
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","A
hundred?"
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Now, I always thought that was funny, The great, powerful
Captain Kirk who owes everything to some unknown alien scientist and a
plundered laboratory."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",You don't rise to the command of a starship or even higher.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",That magnificent mind of his.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","But it can't protect him from
this."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",I press it and he dies.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Now?
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",You really mean it.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",It doesn't matter.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","If Spock fails his
order, he'll be killed anyway."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",You're not even afraid of Starfleet Command.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Can your scheme
bring you that much power so quickly?"
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",And what about me?
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","How does
Marlena fit in?"
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Oiling my traps, darling."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'm afraid I'm a little out of
practice."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Maybe that's what happened to us?
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","It's very hard for a
working officer to shine as a woman every minute, and you demand
perfection."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",I remember when you used to talk that way.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Prove it.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Ship's business?
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",An important task on the crew deck?
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Well, I
guess it's over."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Commander Kenno will take me temporarily.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","He's made
that quite clear."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",I'll call a yeoman to help me with my things.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Are you feeling sorry for me?
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Do I see hesitation in your eyes
about anything?"
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","I want one thing, Captain."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Transfer me.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","On the
Enterprise, I am humiliated!"
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","On another ship, I can hunt fresh game."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","I've got my rank, and."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Don't I?
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","I've been a captain's woman, and I like
it."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","I'll be one again if I have to go through every officer in the
fleet."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",It's been a long time since you've kissed me like that.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","You're
a stranger."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Mercy to the Halkans, mercy to Spock, to me."
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror","Am I your
woman?"
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Take me with you.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",But there are only three of you.
MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Do you know what they'll do to me?
MARLENA,"Mirror,

MARLENA,"Mirror,
Mirror",Captain Kirk.
MARLENA,"Mirror,

KIRK,The Deadly Years,Where is everyone?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"I had a subspace contact with a Robert Johnson, the leader of this expedition, an hour ago."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"No, yet there was something wrong."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I can't pin it down.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"His conversation was disjointed, his thoughts a little foggy, unrelated."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Chekov, check that building."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Mister Spock and I will check this one.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"The rest of you, take a look around."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,See if you can find anyone.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,What is it?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Well?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I'm Captain Kirk of
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I say I'm Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Who are you?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,How old are you?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,How old are you?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Mister Johnson, can you hear me?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Can you tell me what happened?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Did your instruments show anything?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"(to nurse) If they seem lucid, I'll be in the briefing room."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Stay seated.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Commodore Stocker, I've asked you to be part of this briefing because Gamma Hydra Four falls in your administrative area."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Doctor Wallace, as an expert in endocrinology, I'd appreciate you working very closely Doctor McCoy."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Doctor McCoy, would you fill them in?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"What about the atmosphere and environment, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,We're close to the neutral Zone between our Federation and the Romulan empire.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,It's possible the Romulans have a new weapon and are using this colony as guinea pigs.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Good.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I want you all to check out everything in your own departments.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"No matter how remote, how far-fetched the notion, I want it run down."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,We'll stay in orbit until we have the answer.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Yes, Commodore."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,We'll do everything we can to make sure you make your duty.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Doctor, is there something I can do for you?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,How long has it been?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Well, it's been a long time."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Things wouldn't change if it started all over again, would it?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"You have your job, I have my ship, and neither one of us will change."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Well, I supposed that you met someone you loved."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,And in your field as you.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,You didn't give up a thing.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I'm on my way.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Maintain.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,What about the comet that astrophysics reported?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Yes, Commodore."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Thank you.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"You're anxious to get to the base, but we have a few facilities of our own here."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I think the Enterprise will do quite nicely.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"I'll be in engineering, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Maintain standard orbit, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Oh?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Well, follow it."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Progress report, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Astronomical section reports that a comet recently passed by.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Check into that.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Oh, yes."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Let me know what you come up with.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I'll be in the Sickbay.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,You did what you could.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Bones, I believe you're getting grey."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I see what you mean.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Shoulder.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Just a twinge.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Probably muscular strain.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,All right.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Reprimand received.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Go ahead.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Why?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Just muscular strain, isn't it?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,That's impossible.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Scotty!
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Report, Bones."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Spock, could I ask for some figures?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Total senility?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,What a way to die.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,All right.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"I want all the research facilities, all the scientific technicians, to start round-the-clock research immediately."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"I want the answers, and I want the remedy."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Let's start by finding out why Chekov hasn't been affected.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,You feel up to it?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Lieutenant Galway, assume your position."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Start your duties.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"She's ten years younger than I am, and she looks,"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Why hasn't he aged?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Well I want to know!
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Is it his youth, his blood type, his heritage, his glands, his genes?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I'll be on the Bridge.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Keep me posted as to Chekov.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"I thought you were on your way to the biochemistry lab, Doctor."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,So we do.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,You sound like my first officer.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,That didn't spring from logic.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,When did you realise that?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Today?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,How much older was your husband than you?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Answer me.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,That's quite a difference.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Look at me.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Look at me.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,What do you see?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,And old.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,And rapidly growing older.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"What are you offering me, Jan?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Love, or a going away present?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Increase orbit to twenty thousand perigee, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Yeoman.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"(picks the pen up) You have a reason for being on the Bridge, Commodore Stocker?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I have very little time.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,We're going to be late.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I don't intend to leave this area until we've found the solution for this problem.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Yes, yes."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"If you're so concerned, I'll send a message to Starbase Ten."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Yeoman?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Where's that
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Fuel consumption report?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"If I'd signed it, I wouldn't have asked for it, now would l?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I was just thinking.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,You have something to report?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,What is it?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Good, Spock."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Well done.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Let's get this to Doctor McCoy immediately.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Oh.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Lieutenant, take a message to Starfleet Command."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Due to the proximity of the Romulans, you'd better use Code two."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Then use Code three.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Message.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Key to affliction may be comet which passed by Gamma Hydra Four.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Said comet is now,"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Quadrant.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,All units are to be alerted for complete analysis of radiation and means found to neutralise it.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Comet is highly dangerous.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Kirk, commanding Enterprise."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Immediately, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Let's go.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Oh, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Increase orbit to twenty thousand mile perigee.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I fail to understand why each one of my commands is being questioned.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Now do as you're told, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Maintain.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"All right, Bones, I'm going up to the Bridge."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Keep me posted.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Spock?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Bones.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"How long have we got, Bones?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Let it also read that I consider it invalid.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Yes, I would like to make a statement."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I am the captain of this ship and am totally capable of commanding her.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Let's call this whole thing off and get back to work.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Very kind of you, Spock."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,He did not.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I don't have to repeat myself.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"No, I'm thirty four."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I'm thirty four years old.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"I am perfectly capable of speaking in my own defence, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"No, no, no."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"It's all right, Spock."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,It's all right.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"There's only one reason, and one reason alone, for having this, hearing."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I refused to leave Gamma Hydra Two
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Yes.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,A slip of the tongue.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,So I'm a little confused.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Who wouldn't be at a time like this?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"My ship's in trouble, my senior officers are ill. And this nonsense about a competency hearing is enough to mix up any man."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Trying to relieve a captain of his command is, well, that's, that's."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Spock, I wouldn't have believed it of you."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Go ahead.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Ask me questions.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I'll show you what I'm capable of.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,There's nothing wrong with my memory.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Go ahead!
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Ask me anything!
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"We're in orbit around Gamma Hydra Two, right?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Anyhow, it doesn't matter."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,There's a lot more to running a starship than answering a lot of fool questions.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,A lot more.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Go ahead.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Ask me questions.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Ask me anything.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Anything.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Good idea.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Get this stupid voting over with so I can get back to running the ship.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,The most fool thing I ever heard of.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Competency hearing when there's work to be done.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"I'll be in my quarters, awaiting your decision."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,(leaves)
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Spock?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"So, I've been relieved."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Yes.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,You should've been a prosecuting attorney.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Regulations.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Don't give me regulations.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,You've wanted command all along.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,First little excuse you get
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I hope you're proud of.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"What do you mean, you've not assumed command?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"If you're not in command, who is?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Stocker?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Are you crazy?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,He's never had a field command.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,No!
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Don't talk to me about rank!
KIRK,The Deadly Years,The man's a chair-bound paper-pusher.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I order you to take command.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Are you refusing a direct order?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"You traitorous, disloyal, you stab me in the back the first chance you get?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Spock.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Get out.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I never want to have to look at you again.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Jan, Jan."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I made a fool of myself in there.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"I shouldn't have let them confuse me, rattle me."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"But I'm not old, Jan."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I'm not.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,A few muscular aches doesn't make a man old.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,And you don't run a starship with your arms.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,You run it with your head.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,My brain's as sharp as it ever was.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"A simple case of radiation poisoning, and they relieve me of my command."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"I admit I'm getting a little grey, but radiation will do that to you."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Jan, you know me."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Look at me closely.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Tell me.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Am I getting old?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,What are you doing here?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Maybe you'd like to relieve Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,What about Chekov?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Bones, there has to be."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,There has to be.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,We beamed down together.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,We were on the surface together.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,The same spot.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,We were together all the time.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,He left us?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,He left us.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,He went into the building.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Spock, something happened."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,He was scared!
KIRK,The Deadly Years,He saw the dead body and he ran out of the building and he was scared to death.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I'm going up to the bridge.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I have to go to the bridge.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,We're under attack.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Let me go.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,We're under attack.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I have to go to the Bridge.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I've got to go to the bridge.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Greenhorn, up there ruining my ship."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,No.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,No.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,My ship.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,My ship.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,No.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I'll take the first shot.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,How long do you think this ship can take the pounding?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I've got to get up there.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I'll die anyway.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Do it.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Quickly.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Quickly.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Report, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Engineering, this is the captain."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I want full emergency power.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I want everything within about two minutes.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I want the warp drive engines on full standby.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Open up a special channel to Starfleet Command.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Code two.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"That's an order, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Code two.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Message.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,From Enterprise to Starfleet Command this sector.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Have inadvertently encroached upon Romulan Neutral Zone.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Surrounded and under heavy Romulan attack.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Escape impossible, shields failing."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Will implement destruct order using corbomite device recently installed.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Since this will result in the destruction of the Enterprise and all matter in a two hundred thousand kilometre diameter and establish a corresponding dead zone, all Federation ships will avoid this area for the next four solar years."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Explosion will take place in one minute.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Kirk, commanding Enterprise, out."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Mister Sulu, course one eight eight degrees, mark fourteen."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Speed, warp factor eight."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Stand by.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"A logical assumption, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Are they still retreating?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Good.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"All hands, stand by."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Warp factor eight, now."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Are we out of range, Mister Sulu?"
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Secure from Red Alert.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Adjust a new course, two five seven degrees, mark three."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Heading for Starbase Ten.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Noted.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"You should know, however, that there's very little a Starbase can do that a starship can't."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"You're looking good, Doc."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,And yourself?
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Well, gentlemen, all and all, an experience we'll remember in our old age."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Which won't be for some while, I hope."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,"Take over, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Deadly Years,Steady as she goes.
KIRK,The Deadly Years,I thought I said that.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Perhaps they weren't expecting us.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Did he report anything wrong?
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Exactly what it looks like.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Death by natural causes.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Old age.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"He can hear you, Jim, but he doesn't understand."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Let's let him rest.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"The expedition is suffering from extreme old age, and they're growing older by the minute."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Much older.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,My examinations have turned up absolutely nothing.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"In fact, I don't have a clue."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Lieutenant Galway.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Of course.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Go right ahead.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,It's probably nothing important.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Well, don't worry about it."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Perhaps a little hypersonic treatment might clear it up.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,The last one.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Robert Johnson.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Cause of death, old age."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Which adds up to absolutely nothing.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"All you need are vitamins, but you can come up anyhow."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,You take over my job and see what happens to you.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"What's your problem, Jim?"
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"You're probably right, Doctor."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"By the way, I don't like how you've been running this ship lately."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Jim, I think we better'd run a complete physical on you."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"No, Jim."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"It's advanced arthritis, and it's spreading."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"I can run it through again, but I'll come up with the same thing."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"All of us who went down to the surface, with the exception of Chekov, are aging at various rates."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Approximately thirty years for each day.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,I don't know what's causing it.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"A virus, a bacteria, or evil spirits, but I'm trying to find out."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,I'm doing what I can.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,(to Spock) You're perfectly healthy.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"I did not say you weren't affected, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"You are perfectly healthy, that is, for any normal Vulcan on the high side of a hundred."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"You can leave, too, Lieutenant Galway."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Lieutenant Galway?
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Yes, I spoke to you."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"I said that you could leave, too."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Now why don't you go down to your quarters and get some sleep.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"People age normally at different speeds, Jim."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,I don't know.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,His genes.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"All right, nurse."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Prepare Chekov for another complete physical.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Then try that, Doctor Wallace."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Try anything, but do it quickly."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Radiation?
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"That's as good an answer as any, but why didn't we know about it earlier?"
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"(to Wallace) Run this through, Doctor."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Well, I see I'm not going to be making any house calls on you."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"I'm not a magician, Spock, just an old country doctor."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Well, then we just start over, that's all."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"We work harder, faster, and we start completely from scratch if we have to."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,But we find something.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Now this isn't going to hurt a bit.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Did it hurt?
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,She's dead.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Her metabolism caused her to age more rapidly than the rest of us, but the same thing's going to happen to us unless"
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Oh, a matter of days."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Perhaps hours.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"(waking up) Yes, Spock?"
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,What is it?
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,I did.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Yes.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Captain Kirk is suffering from a, a peculiar physical degeneration which strongly resembles aging."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Yes, yes, but he's a better man right now"
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"It's a blasted machine, Spock!"
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,You can't argue with a machine.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Yes.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Yes, I do, agree."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"And I am sorry, Jim."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Nothing.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Absolutely nothing.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Yes, yes."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Now that could be.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Right.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Scared.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Heart beats faster, breathe gets short, and there's cold sweats and adrenaline flows."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Adrenal activity.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Now hold on Just a minute.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,There was something that I read once.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"It was ancient history, just after the atomic age."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Used for radiation sickness.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Adrenaline.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Yes, yes."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Now.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"But before, adrenaline."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Highly promising.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Early research, but they abandoned it when hyronalin was discovered."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Don't just stand there jawing, Spock."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,You and Doctor Wallace get cracking.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"No, Jim."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,You can't do it.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Nurse?
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Doctor Wallace!
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Nurse.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Jim-boy, you just lay quiet."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,You can't do no good.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,We're both through.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,All right.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Let's, let's go."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Don't give me any Vulcan details.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Just give me the shot.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,You can't.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Well, well, what's happening?"
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Feeling fine.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,So is Scotty.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,The serum worked.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"He pulled a muscle during the reaction, but otherwise he's feeling fine."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Oh, very well."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,A few bruises here and there.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,Oh.
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Anytime you're ready, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"Because of your Vulcan physique, I have prepared an extremely potent shot for you."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,"However, you might like to know I've removed all the breakables from Sickbay."
MCCOY,The Deadly Years,I thought you'd be pleased to hear that.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Our arrival was scheduled well in advance, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,The annual check of every scientific expedition is routine.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Quite impossible, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,I ran a personnel check on this expedition before we beamed down.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,I assure you that none of them were
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Sensors reveal nothing which is inimical to human life.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,The atmosphere screens out the usual amount of harmful cosmic rays.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"I have already begun investigation into that possibility, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"I've rechecked the sensors, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Gamma Hydra Four checks out as a Class M planet with a conventional oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere and normal mass.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,I can find nothing at all out of the ordinary.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,We're checking it on it.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,I've reached no conclusions as yet.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,The comet was a rogue and has never been investigated.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"All research lines negative, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"I'm doing that, Captain, as per your previous order."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,We discussed that earlier.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"(looking about the same as usual) Based on what Doctor McCoy gave me, I estimate that physically we each have less than a week to live."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Also, since our mental faculties are aging faster than our bodies, we will be little better than mental vegetables in considerably lesser time."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,In a very short time.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"(sitting up) I must differ with you, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"I'm having difficulty concentrating, which is most disturbing, my eye sight appears to be failing, and the normal temperature of the ship seems to me to be increasingly cold."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Captain, you sent such a message this morning."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Captain, I believe (notices, and wakes him gently) Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Captain.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Quite understandable.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,We have the cause of the affliction.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,The orbit of Gamma Hydra Four carried the planet directly through the comet's trail.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"On conventional radiation settings, we discovered nothing."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"On resetting our sensors to the extreme lower range of the scale, undetected radiation appeared."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Below normal radiation levels but definitely present, and undoubtedly residue from the comet."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"(consulting PADD) Quadrant four four eight, sir."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Mister Sulu, what is our present position?"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Possibly, Doctor, because my thinking processes are not as efficient as before."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,I have a question for the doctor.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"(Kirk leaves) Doctor, the ship's temperature is increasingly uncomfortable for me."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"I've adjusted the environment in my quarters to one hundred twenty five degrees, which is at least tolerable."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"However, I"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,I wondered if perhaps there was something which could lower my sensitivity to cold.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Yes.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,As I always suspected.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,(leaves)
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Commodore?
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,I am aware of that.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"For what, sir?"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"On what grounds, Commodore?"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Need I remind you, sir, that I too have contracted the same affliction?"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"I'm half human, sir."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"My physical reflexes are down, my mental capacity is reduced."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,I tire easily.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"No, sir."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,I am not fit for command.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Sir, I do have duties to perform."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"I resist that suggestion, Commodore."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Very well, sir."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,The hearing shall convene at fourteen hundred hours.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Let it read that this competency hearing was ordered by Commodore Stocker and reluctantly called by myself.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"On the contrary, Commodore."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"As presiding officer and as second in command of the Enterprise, the responsibility is mine."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Captain Kirk, would you like to make a statement?"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"It is quite impossible, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,The regulations are quite specific.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,You are entitled to direct examination of all witnesses immediately after the board has questioned them.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Mister Sulu, how long have you served with Captain Kirk?"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"To your knowledge, has he ever had any difficulty making decisions?"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Did he order you to maintain standard orbit around Gamma Hydra Four?
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order?"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Did he order you to increase orbit?
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Did he not several minutes later repeat that order?
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Mister Sulu, please answer the question."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Thank you, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Yeoman Atkins, you handed Captain Kirk a fuel consumption report in the presence of witnesses, which he read and signed."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Is that correct?
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Yeoman, you will simply answer the question."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,You guess?
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Thank you, Yeoman."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,You may leave.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Lieutenant Uhura.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,I have here a bulletin from Starfleet Command which states that the Romulans have broken Code two.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Are these your initials which appear at the bottom?
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,And whose initials are those which appear directly below yours?
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Did Captain Kirk ask you to send a message about the comet which passed Gamma Hydra Four?
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Using Code two.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code two.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Doctor McCoy, Doctor McCoy!"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Several hours ago, at the request of this board, you ran a complete physical examination of Captain Kirk."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Medical banks, compute described subject's physical age, using established norms as comparative base."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Doctor McCoy.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Will you give us your professional evaluation of Captain Kirk's present physical condition.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Is not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly?
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Doctor, you heard the computer's analysis of Captain Kirk's physical age."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Do you agree with it?
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Do you agree with it, Doctor?"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,This board has no further questions.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Unless you, Commodore Stocker, have something that you would like to add."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Do you wish to call any witnesses, Captain Kirk?"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Captain, I would suggest"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Gamma Hydra Four, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"You're inability to remember having given commands, reading and signing important orders and then forgetting them, your physical analysis as compiled by our own chief surgeon."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,All these things would appear to be irrefutable proof of failing physical and mental conditions.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"We have no more questions, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"There'll be no more questions, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,If you would leave the room so the board can vote
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Sir, you have never commanded a starship."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,The danger from the Romulans
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"I'm sorry, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Regulations require
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Captain, I have not assumed command."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"I suffer the same affliction as you, sir."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Commodore Stocker.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Mister Scott was unfit for command.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Commodore Stocker is ranking officer
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"I cannot, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"No, sir."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Only Commodore Stocker can give a command order onboard this ship.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,It would seem to be the place where I can be of the most use.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"No, not all the time."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Captain, he left us for a few moments."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Yes.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Yes, indeed, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Doctor, you remember"
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Quite possible, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,Perhaps a sufficiently efficacious compound could be developed.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Doctor, I made the necessary computations and produced this serum."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"It is crude and dangerous, but we have no time for refinements."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"It could cure or kill, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Doctor Wallace, give him the shot."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Romulans giving ground, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Obviously, they tapped in as you expected them to."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"The Romulans were caught off guard, Captain."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,They're falling behind.
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"I am quite ready now, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Deadly Years,"That is very considerate of you, Doctor."
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,Captain!
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,Captain!
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,Captain!
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,Captain!
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"A man, sir."
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,In there.
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,A dead man.
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,Promises.
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"Give us some more blood, Chekov."
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"The needle won't hurt, Chekov."
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"Take off your shirt, Chekov."
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"Roll over, Chekov."
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"Breathe deeply, Chekov."
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"Blood sample, Chekov."
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"Marrow sample, Chekov."
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"Skin sample, Chekov."
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"If I live long enough, I'm going to run out of samples."
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"Oh, yes."
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"I'll live, but I won't enjoy it."
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,That's what you said the last time.
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,Yes.
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"Commodore Stocker, what are your orders?"
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,Commodore!
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,(But he is transfixed by the sight of another weapon blast heading for them on the viewscreen.)
CHEKOV,The Deadly Years,"Sir, the Romulans do not take captives."
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,(He is interrupted by the entrance of an old man and woman.
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,(to the woman) They've come to pay their respects to Alvin.
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,You'll have to speak louder.
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,I'm Robert Johnson.
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,"This is my wife, Elaine."
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,"I'm, er, let me see."
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,"I am twenty nine, and Elaine is"
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,I can hear you.
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,"Not deaf yet, you know."
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,Not yet.
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,What happened?
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,Elaine was so beautiful.
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,So beautiful.
ROBERT,The Deadly Years,So beautiful.
ELAINE,The Deadly Years,I'm twenty seven.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"I appreciate that, sir."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,I'm sure you understand that I'm anxious to get to Starbase Ten to assume my new post.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Thank you, sir."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,Captain Kirk?
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,Facilities at Starbase Ten are much more complete than those on board ship.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,It seems to me that your investigations would be facilitated if we proceeded there.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,I assure you all co-operation.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,I'd hoped for a few words with you at your convenience.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"If I may say so sir, we have a due date at Starbase Ten."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Captain, I'm watching four very valuable and one almost irreplaceable members of the Starfleet failing before my eyes."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,I want to do something to help.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Spock, can I have a word with you?"
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Mister Spock, a starship can function with a Chief Engineer, a Chief Medical Officer, even a First Officer under physical par."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,But it's disastrous to have a commanding officer whose condition is any less than perfection.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,Please understand me.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,My admiration for Captain Kirk is unbounded.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,He is a great officer.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"But Mister Spock, I need your help and your co-operation."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,I would like you to take over command of the Enterprise.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"On the grounds that the captain, because of his affliction, is unable to perform his duties."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Yes, but you're a Vulcan."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,You have a much greater life span.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,You show the affects to a much smaller degree.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Well, if you are not, with your Vulcan physique, then obviously Captain Kirk cannot be."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,Mister Spock.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,I do not like what I'm about to say but regulations demand it.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"And as a Starfleet flag officer, I must follow regulations."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"As second in command of the Enterprise, you must convene an extraordinary competency hearing."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,It's not a matter of choice.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"When a captain is unfit, physically or mentally, a competency hearing is mandatory."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,Please don't make me quote a regulation which you know as well as I do.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Mister Spock, may I make a statement?"
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,I have had to resort to these legal grounds in order to save the lives of some very valuable members of the Starfleet.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"I have tried to convince Captain Kirk of the necessity of proceeding to Starbase Ten, but I've been overruled in each case."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,The responsibility of this hearing is mine.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"The computer differs with you, Captain."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,No.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"I am quite satisfied, Mister Spock."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Well, since the senior officers are incapable and I am of flag rank, I am forced by regulations to assume command."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"What would you have, a junior officer with far less experience than I have?"
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Mister Spock, we have to save these people."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Mister Sulu, set a direct course for Starbase Ten."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,Warp five.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Immediately, Mister Sulu."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,All officers are to return to their posts.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Thank you, Mister Sulu."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Lieutenant Uhura, let me know if we contact any Romulan."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,Keep trying to raise the Romulans.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"If I could talk to them, explain to them why we violated the Neutral Zone."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Opinion, Mister Sulu."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Well then, we have no alternative but to surrender."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,What am I going to do?
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,I've got to do something.
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"Captain, I just wanted to assure you that I did what I thought best to save you and the men."
STOCKER,The Deadly Years,"If I may say so, Captain, I am now quite aware of what a starship can do with the right man at the helm."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"(a young blonde woman in a pink dress) Yes, Captain."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"Well, be a little less the cool, efficient Captain and a little more the old friend."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"Six years, four months, and an odd number of days."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,You mean you don't know?
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,You said it.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,I didn't.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"In all those years, I only heard from you once."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,A stargram when my husband died.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"You know, you never asked me why I got married after we called it off."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,I met a man I admired.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,A great man.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,No.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,Just you.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"A few years ago on Aldebaran Three, my husband and I tried various carbohydrate compounds to slow down the degeneration of plant life."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"Yes, sir."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,(leaves)
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,We both go in the same direction.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"Look, we know the problem."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,We know the progress of the affliction.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"Therefore, once we find the proper line of research, it's only logical we find the solution."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,No problem is insoluble.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,Not even ours.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,Our situation doesn't have its roots in logic.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,The heart is not a logical organ.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"When I married Theodore Wallace, I thought I was over you."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,I was wrong.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,What?
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,What difference does that make?
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,Twenty six years.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"Jim, he was a brilliant man."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,We were stationed on a lonely outpost.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,We were working together.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,I don't want to talk about him.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,I want to talk about us.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"I see Captain James Kirk, a man of morality, decency, handsome, and strong."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"Jim, please."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"Doctor McCoy, none of our usual radiation therapies will have any effect on this radiation sickness."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"Oh, Jim."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,I'm sorry.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,Truly I am.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,Everybody understood.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"Oh, Jim, will you forgive me?"
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,I have work to do.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"Doctor, hyronalin is the specific accepted for all radiation sickness."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,Jim.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"Jim, if I have to give you a shot"
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,"Jim, it could kill you."
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,The ageing process has stopped.
WALLACE,The Deadly Years,His bodily functions are getting stronger.
UHURA,The Deadly Years,"Captain Kirk, Mister Spock would like to see you on the Bridge."
UHURA,The Deadly Years,"But, Captain, the Romulans have broken Code two."
UHURA,The Deadly Years,If you remember the last bulletin
UHURA,The Deadly Years,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,The Deadly Years,Code three.
UHURA,The Deadly Years,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,The Deadly Years,They are.
UHURA,The Deadly Years,Those of Captain Kirk.
UHURA,The Deadly Years,He did.
UHURA,The Deadly Years,"Oh, yes, but he changed it to Code three."
UHURA,The Deadly Years,Yes.
UHURA,The Deadly Years,"I think we just made contact, sir."
UHURA,The Deadly Years,"Engineering wants instructions, sir."
UHURA,The Deadly Years,"I'm trying, Commodore."
UHURA,The Deadly Years,The Romulans are notorious for not listening to explanations.
UHURA,The Deadly Years,"Sir, I've tried all known hailing frequencies."
UHURA,The Deadly Years,They simply ignore us.
UHURA,The Deadly Years,"But, Captain, Code"
UHURA,The Deadly Years,"Yes, Captain."
UHURA,The Deadly Years,Code two.
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Standard orbit, Captain."
SULU,The Deadly Years,"You already gave that command, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,You'll live.
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Maintaining standard orbit, Captain."
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,"You mean another twenty thousand, Captain?"
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Orbiting at twenty thousand, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Maintaining, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Two years, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,"No, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Yes, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Yes, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Yes, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Yes, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,Captain Kirk repeated his order.
SULU,The Deadly Years,Across the Neutral Zone?
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Entering Romulan Neutral Zone, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,All sensors on maximum.
SULU,The Deadly Years,Romulans approaching from both sides.
SULU,The Deadly Years,"We're bracketed, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Lieutenant Uhura is right, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,We've tangled with them before.
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Sir, they've fired another."
SULU,The Deadly Years,They know they have us.
SULU,The Deadly Years,They know our shields will give out.
SULU,The Deadly Years,"We're losing power, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,We're surrounded by Romulan vessels.
SULU,The Deadly Years,Maximum of ten.
SULU,The Deadly Years,Range fifty to a hundred thousand kilometres.
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Standing by, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Yes, sir."
SULU,The Deadly Years,And out of the Neutral Zone.
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Two five seven degrees, mark three."
SULU,The Deadly Years,"Steady as she goes, Captain."
GALWAY,The Deadly Years,"(a petite woman) Doctor, may I speak to you for a moment, please?"
GALWAY,The Deadly Years,"I know this is going to sound foolish, but I seem to be having a little trouble hearing."
GALWAY,The Deadly Years,I never had trouble before.
GALWAY,The Deadly Years,Thank you.
GALWAY,The Deadly Years,What?
GALWAY,The Deadly Years,"You spoke to me, Doctor?"
GALWAY,The Deadly Years,No.
GALWAY,The Deadly Years,I don't want to sleep.
GALWAY,The Deadly Years,Can't you understand?
GALWAY,The Deadly Years,"If I sleep, what will I find when I wake up?"
GALWAY,The Deadly Years,"Thank you, sir."
GALWAY,The Deadly Years,(on her way out) What a stupid place to hang a mirror.
GALWAY,The Deadly Years,Doctor.
SCOTT,The Deadly Years,"Doctor McCoy, this is Scott."
SCOTT,The Deadly Years,May I come see you?
SCOTT,The Deadly Years,"Captain, can I go back to my station?"
SCOTT,The Deadly Years,Of course I do.
SCOTT,The Deadly Years,"I just need a wee bit of rest, that's all."
CHAPEL,The Deadly Years,"Come along, Ensign."
CHAPEL,The Deadly Years,This won't hurt.
CHAPEL,The Deadly Years,Much.
CHAPEL,The Deadly Years,"Easy, Captain."
ATKINS,The Deadly Years,"(a blonde yeoman) Will you sign this, sir?"
ATKINS,The Deadly Years,Sir?
ATKINS,The Deadly Years,I gave it to you.
ATKINS,The Deadly Years,You signed it.
ATKINS,The Deadly Years,"Your signature, Captain."
ATKINS,The Deadly Years,"Sir, he had more important things on his mind."
ATKINS,The Deadly Years,"I, I guess he forgot he'd signed it."
ATKINS,The Deadly Years,He'd forgot he'd signed it.
COMPUTER,The Deadly Years,Working.
COMPUTER,The Deadly Years,"Subject's physical age based on physiological profile, between sixty and seventy two."
COMPUTER,The Deadly Years,Aging rapidly.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Good morning, sir, Doctor."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","It will not be necessary, Captain."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",I am in total control of your ship.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","I have connected the
matter-antimatter pods to the main navigational bank."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","A trigger relay
is now in operation."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Any attempts to alter course will result in
immediate destruction of this vessel."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",I assure you we are no threat to humanity or humanoid life.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","We
mean you no harm, but we require your ship."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","I control the trigger relay, sir."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","I cannot be overcome by
physical means, and if you attempt to use your phasers, the trigger
relay will be activated."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","We shall continue on our present course for
approximately four solar days, at which time we shall arrive at our
destination."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",I am not programmed to respond in that area.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Captain Kirk.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","The following individuals
will be transported down to our planet."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Yourself, science officer,
medical officer, communications officer and navigator."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","If you do not come with me, your engines will be destroyed and
you will remain in orbit here forever."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",There is a word.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Among us there is no corresponding meaning,
but it seems to mean something to you humans."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Please.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Our planet's surface is what you classify as K-type, adaptable
for humans by use of pressure domes and life-support systems."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","(to one
of two identical women standing by a doorway.)"
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",I have brought them.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",You'll find this quite comfortable.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Your quarters are down the
hall."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",The makers designed us.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",They came from the galaxy of Andromeda.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","They were, as you say, quite humanoid, but, unlike your
civilisation, robots were common."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","We performed the necessary service
functions and freed our makers to evolve a perfect social order."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Our home planet's sun became a nova.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Only a few exploratory
outposts survived."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","This unit, myself, was part of one such outpost in
your galaxy."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","No, Captain."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",They died over the stretch of time.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",We lacked it for a long time.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",(he leaves)
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","I trust you are enjoying yourself, Mister Spock."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",It is our central control complex.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Two hundred and seven thousand, eight hundred and nine."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","(his number 1 collar flashes) I am not programmed to respond in
this area."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","You may command us to make anything for you, or do the work
yourself for pleasure."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","You may have the services of any number of
craftsmen, exclusive use of the computer facilities."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Anything.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","We only wish to make you happy and comfortable, Captain."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","If we
are to serve your kind, we must understand you."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Our Lord, Harry Mudd
was only one example for us."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Now we are learning a great deal from all
of you."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","We can no longer take your orders, Harry Mudd."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Our makers were wise.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",They programmed us to serve.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","You are correct, Captain."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Harry Mudd is flawed, even for a
human being."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","We recognised this from the beginning but used his
knowledge to obtain more specimens."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Your species is self-destructive.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",You need our help.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","We will not harm you, but we will take the starship, and you
will remain on this planet."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","We cannot allow any race as greedy and corruptible as yours to
have free run of the galaxy."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",We shall serve them.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Their kind will be eager to accept our
service."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Soon they will become completely dependent upon us.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",We shall take care of them.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Yes, Captain."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","And we shall serve them and you will be happy,
and controlled."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",What are you doing here?
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",That is illogical.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",We can move more quickly than you.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","We are
invulnerable to attack."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",We are much stronger.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",No.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",That is contradictory.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",It is not logical.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Mister Spock.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Explain.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",You cannot have killed him.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",You have no weapons.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",That is irrational.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Illogical.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Dreams are not real.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",There is no explosive.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",But there was no explosion.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",What?
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","You say you are lying, but if everything you say is a lie then
you are telling the truth, but you cannot tell the truth because
everything you say is a lie."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",You lie.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",You tell the truth.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","But you
cannot for."
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Illogical!
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Illogical!
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Please explain.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",You are human.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd",Only humans can explain their behaviour.
NORMAN,"I,
Mudd","Please
explain."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Something wrong?
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Perhaps you're making a rather hasty judgment.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Mister Norman has
only been aboard seventy two hours."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Specifics, Doctor."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Labels do not make arguments.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",I see.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",I find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","That's not at all surprising, Doctor."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","He's probably terrified of
your beads and rattles."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Interesting.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Confirmed, Captain."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",He's taken out all the override controls.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","If
we tamper without knowing where the trigger relay is,
we could extinguish ourselves."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",And most sophisticated.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","(attempting a mind meld) He simply appears to have turned
himself off, Captain."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","And since we cannot repair the damage he has done
without destroying the ship"
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Five hundred of the same model?
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",That seems rather redundant.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",He did not pay royalties.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",The guilty party has his choice.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Death by electrocution, death
by gas, death by phaser, death by hanging."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","You went to substantial risk and effort to bring a starship
here."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Logically, you must have a compelling motive."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Then I'm unable to discern your problem.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Whom do you serve now?
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","We are, and we must direct our attack to the heart of the
matter."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Obviously this many androids cannot operate independently.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","There must be a central control system which guides the entire android
population."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Very interesting.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Very interesting.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","This is a most unusual
device."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Did I understand there are more than two hundred thousand of
you?"
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",This would seem to be a simple relay centre.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Are all of you
controlled through this device?"
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Oh, that's quite understandable."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Captain, I've just had a most fascinating
meeting with Norman, and I'm convinced I've discovered a very important
inconsistency."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","He could successfully accomplish it, Captain."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","I've questioned a
number of the androids, and they're totally loyal to Mudd."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Perhaps of more concern is the fact that this android population can
literally provide anything a human being could ask for in unlimited
quantity."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants
and desires are not fulfilled."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","I'm curious, Norman."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Just how do you intend to stop them?
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Eminently practical.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Indeed, it is not."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","They may quite possibly be able to accomplish
it."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Whatever method we use to stop them, we must make haste."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","They
have only to install some cybernetic devices aboard the Enterprise and
they'll be able to leave orbit."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",I asked them.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Yet the device that Norman claims to be their central control is
totally inadequate to the task of directing more than two hundred
thousand of them."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","There are a large number of Alices and Trudies, Maisies,
Annabels, and according to my research, a Herman series, an Oscar
series, a whole plethora of series in fact."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",But only one Norman.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","To function as they do, each android mind must be one component
of a mass brain linked through a central locus."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",That would seem logical.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","What would seem to be a sound, and perhaps our only,
opportunity."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","I fail to understand why I should care to induce my mother to
purchase falsified patents."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Of course.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Your computations would
inevitably lead to a total description of the parabolic intersection of
dimension with dimension."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Thank you.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",I love you.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","However, I hate you."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Yes, of course."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",That is exactly why I hate you.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Because you are
identical."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Success, Captain."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","We've been pruning the leaves and branches of
the tree."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Now it is time to get to work on the root.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Affirmative.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Logic is a little tweeting bird chirping in a meadow.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Logic is a
wreath of pretty flowers which smell bad."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Are you sure your circuits are registering correctly?
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Your ears are
green."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Very well, Captain."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","I believe that is the correct amount, Captain."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Mister Mudd, are
you ready?"
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",Be careful.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",I would not want you to drop it.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","I believe they are all immobilised, Captain."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","That is a human emotion, Doctor, with which I am totally
unfamiliar."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",How could I be unhappy?
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Which I find eminently satisfactory, Doctor, for nowhere am I so
desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",The androids are being reprogrammed.
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd","Their original purpose was
to adapt this planet for productive use."
SPOCK,"I,
Mudd",They'll begin that work again.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",Yes.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","There's something odd about that man, and I can't quite
pinpoint it."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","I know when something doesn't strike me right, and he doesn't."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",All right.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","There's something wrong about a man who never smiles,
whose conversation never varies from the routine of the job, and who
won't talk about his background."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","Spock, I mean that it's odd for a non-Vulcan."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","The ears make all
the difference."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","Maybe, but you can't evaluate a man by logic alone."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","Besides, he
has avoided two appointments that I've made for his physical exam
without reason."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","Oh, I find that shocking."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","(noticing a curtained alcove) Harry, what's this?"
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",Dead?
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",That's very interesting.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","You leave your wife and then bring her
along."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",Then your makers weren't humanoid?
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",I think Mister Chekov's right.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",We are in a lot of trouble.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","Jim, you should see the research facilities."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","They've got a lab
down there that."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","Well, I could spend the rest of my life studying it."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","I wouldn't be bored, I can tell you that."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",I did.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",And you can forget it.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","They're perfect, flawless,
mentally and physically."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","No weaknesses, perfectly disciplined."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","No vices, no fears, no faults."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",Just a sense of purpose.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","Believe me,
there's nothing tougher to overcome, even among humans."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",How do you know so much?
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",Oh.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",You wanted to leave us on this ruddy rock and leave by yourself.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",He is dying.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",Completely inner directed.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",Oblivious to everything.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","All right, it's worked so far, but we're not
out yet."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",(in a monotone) You offer us only well-being.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","Suffering, in torment and pain."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",Labouring without end.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",He's dead.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd",Easy now.
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","Oh, he's caught it!"
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","Well, you must be very unhappy, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","Well, we found a whole world of minds that work just like yours."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","Logical, unemotional, completely pragmatic."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","And we poor, irrational
humans whipped them in a fair fight."
MCCOY,"I,
Mudd","Now you'll find yourself back
among us illogical humans again."
JORDAN,"I,
Mudd",Command personnel only.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Yes, Mister Sulu?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Correct it.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Auxiliary control, this is the captain."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Auxiliary control, what's
going on down there?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Kirk to Security.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Intruder alert, deck eight, auxiliary control."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Lieutenant Uhura, have Mister Spock report to the bridge."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","What's the imposed course, Mister Sulu?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Kirk here.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Any sign of the intruder?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Find him.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Kirk out.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Mister Spock, we seem to
be taking an unscheduled ride."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Mister Sulu, cut in emergency manual monitor."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","I want the override
broken."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Emergency manual monitor, report."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",This is Captain Kirk.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Acknowledge.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Emergency manual monitor, this is the
captain."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Report.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Acknowledge.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",This is the captain.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Scotty, acknowledge."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Scotty, what's going on down there?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Kirk to Engineering.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",This is the captain.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Scotty, report."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Scotty, the intruder is in your area."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",What's going on down there?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Scotty!
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Scotty.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Scotty.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Scotty?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Security, the intruder is in the
engineering section."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Have all units converge on that point.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Cut power.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Spock, take over."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Tell Security we've found the intruder.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Do you mind telling me
what this is all about, mister?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Spock?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Who are you?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",You require?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Who and what are we?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",An android.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Who sent you?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",It seems we're going to take a little trip.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Any meetings or discussions can be held aboard the Enterprise.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",I must say that's a gracious invitation.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",And what is that word?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",I don't believe it.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Harry Mudd.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Ruler?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Harry, I want control of my ship returned immediately."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","We
have no intention of staying as your guests."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Oh, do I know him."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Harcourt Fenton Mudd, thief"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Swindler and con man
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Liar and rogue.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","He belongs in jail, which is where I thought I left you, Mudd."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Mudd, I want that trained machine of yours, Norman, to deactivate
the trigger mechanism and free my ship."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",I'm telling you now.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","All right, I'll listen."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",What are you telling?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Harry Mudd, you're a liar and an outlaw and in deep trouble."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","I
want navigational control restored, my ship released."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","All right, Harry, explain."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",How did you get here?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","We left you in
custody after that affair on the Rigel mining planet."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Did you pay royalties to the owners of those patents?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Who caught you?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Yes.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Who caught you?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",And the Denebians contacted the Vulcans.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",That's what I would have done.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",He broke jail.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",He stole a spaceship.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",They fired at him.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Go on, get on with it, Harry."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",They picked a fine representative.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","I think not, Harry."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Who?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Yes.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",My ship.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Norman, who created you?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",What became of them?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Then some of your makers survive.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",All right.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",We might later.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","In the meantime, would you mind
leaving us?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Because we don't like you.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Now.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",(shooing away gesture)
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Well, opinions?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","That's a great help, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Bones?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Spock.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",And if you say we're in a lot of trouble.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Try and find it.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","The rest of you, look around, learn everything
you can."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",I'll see what else I can find out from Mister Mudd.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Let's go.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Very impressive.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","I must say, I like the styling."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Don't you believe in male androids, Harry?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Don't lose your head, Bones."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Nobody's staying anywhere.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Scotty, you were ordered to stay aboard."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","What does she mean, the last one?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Are you out of your mind?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","(grabs Mudd by the throat) You can't
beam down an entire crew of a spaceship."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Somebody has to be on board.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Harry, Harry, you'll never get away with it."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Starfleet.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",I'm trying not to.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Yes, I know."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",That's what worries me.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","How will my crew react in a
world where they can have everything they want simply by asking for it."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Is that the way you're going to do it, Mudd?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Hit my people at
their weakest point?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","All right, here we are, birds in a gilded
cage."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","The question is, how do we get out of here?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",All right.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","We're getting back to the ship, and don't you forget
it."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Straighten up!
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","This may be a gilded cage filled with everything you
always wanted, but it's still a cage."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",We don't belong here.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","We belong
on that ship up there."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",No.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Yes.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",My ship.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",ALICE and  To respond in that area.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Yes, I know."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Alice, give us back our ship to please us."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Return us to our ship
because we desire it."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",But we're unhappy here.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",We want the Enterprise.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","No, it's a beautiful lady, and we love her."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Interesting.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Bones, have you had time to take any psychological readings of
the androids?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Yes.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","That's what this crew needs, a little sense of purpose."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Mudd, a few questions I want to ask you."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Yes.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",My ship.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Harry, I think they have something else in mind."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",We prefer to help ourselves.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","We make mistakes, but we're human."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",And maybe that's the word that best explains us.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",The whole galaxy controlled by your kind?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","So far this thing has had its amusing
aspects, but that threat the androids made about taking over all the
humans in the galaxy is not very funny."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Why shouldn't they answer our questions?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","They don't think we can
do anything to stop them."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","All right, what have we got to work with?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",I agree.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",What in your opinion does direct them?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Norman.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","When I told one of the Alices that the Enterprise was a
lovely lady and we loved her, she said, Norman, co-ordinate."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Why
Norman?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Unless
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Named Norman.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Forming one gigantic, highly intelligent mind."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","And
the glowing badges, they indicate the mind in operation."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Yes, logical."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",That's what it is.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","And that in turn gives us a
weapon that we can use against them."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","We must use wild, insane,
irrational illogic aimed right at Norman!"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Let's get to the point.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Harry, you said you wanted to help."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Do
you?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","That's fine, Harry."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","The androids will be expecting us to make a
break for it, and that's where you come in."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Nothing, Harry."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Just go to sleep.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Oh, Harry."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",I do believe you're putting on weight.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",We have a medical problem.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Your ex-Lord, Harry Mudd."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","We are caring for him, but our doctor needs his medical equipment
aboard the Enterprise."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",You are programmed to serve.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","If we're not allowed access to our
medical equipment, Harry Mudd will die."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",He will cease to function.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","You
will have failed to serve."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Oh, yes."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Uhura, why did you tell her?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Uhura.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Beautiful!
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Next, we take the Alices on a trip through Wonderland."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Yes.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Your attention.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",They're celebrating.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Their captivity.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Do you enjoy the music?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",She likes him.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Mister Chekov.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","The floor is no place for an
officer."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Attention!
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Now stand absolutely still.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","That's better, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Your statement is illogical.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Good.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",I wonder how Spock's doing.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Well?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","If Norman is the control centre, he should be in a bind by what
we've done."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","If we can overload him further, we should be able to
immobilise all of them."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Does everybody remember what to do?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Acknowledged.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",I want you to surrender.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","No, we are stronger."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",I'll prove it to you.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Can you harm a man
that you're programmed to serve?"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Why not?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Scotty.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Scotty's dead.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",He had too much happiness.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","But now he's
happier he's dead, and we'll miss him."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Let us hear it for our poor,
dead friend."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","What is a man but that lofty spirit, that sense of enterprise,
that devotion to something that cannot be sensed, cannot be realised
but only dreamed!"
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",The highest reality.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",How did you like it?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Our logic is to be illogical.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",That is our advantage.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Mister
Spock, it is time."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",The explosive.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Watch it!
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Watch it!
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",No?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Observe.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Fore!
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",(Mudd swings.)
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Boom!
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Are you all right?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",He lied.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Everything Harry tells you is a lie.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Remember that.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Everything Harry tells you is a lie.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",I am not programmed to respond in that area.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Good.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Why, thank you."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",A partnership arrangement?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",You and me?
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",I've got something else in mind.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Let's go.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Touché, Bones."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Yes, Mudd, you've been paroled to the android population of this
planet."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","No, you're an irritant."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","You'll stay here and provide a
first-class example to the androids of a human failure."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","They'll learn
by close observation how to avoid ones like you in the future."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","As long as you continue to be an irritant, Harry."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",It's up to you.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Yes, you are."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Oh, there's one more thing, Harry."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","We've programmed
a special android attendant to take care of your every need."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","She'll help you find an incentive to work with the androids and not
exploit them."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Yes.
KIRK,"I,
Mudd","Goodbye, Harry."
KIRK,"I,
Mudd",Have fun.
SULU,"I,
Mudd","There's an unplanned course change being fed into the
instruments, sir."
SULU,"I,
Mudd","I can't, sir."
SULU,"I,
Mudd","Sir, auxiliary control is on total override."
SULU,"I,

ROWE,"I,
Mudd","Lieutenant Rowe here, sir."
ROWE,"I,
Mudd",Acknowledged.
ROWE,"I,
Mudd",Take care of him.
ROWE,"I,
Mudd",Security to Captain Kirk.
ROWE,"I,
Mudd","Lieutenant Rowe, sir."
ROWE,"I,
Mudd","I'm in auxiliary
control."
ROWE,"I,
Mudd",Ensign Jordan's been knocked out.
ROWE,"I,

been jammed."
ROWE,"I,
Mudd",They're totally unworkable.
ROWE,"I,
Mudd","No, sir."
ROWE,"I,
Mudd",He's gone.
ROWE,"I,
Mudd","I've put out a full
security alert on all decks."
UHURA,"I,
Mudd","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"I,
Mudd",I should say so.
UHURA,"I,
Mudd",How long does a body like that last?
UHURA,"I,
Mudd",Five hundred thousand years?
UHURA,"I,
Mudd","And it is a very pleasant place, Captain."
UHURA,"I,
Mudd","Oh, nothing really important."
UHURA,"I,
Mudd",Just immortality.
UHURA,"I,
Mudd","No, they're lying."
UHURA,"I,
Mudd",It's a trick.
UHURA,"I,
Mudd","Doctor McCoy injected something
into Harry Mudd to make him look sick."
UHURA,"I,
Mudd","It's a trick
to get back on board and sabotage the ship."
UHURA,"I,
Mudd",Because I want an android body.
UHURA,"I,
Mudd",I want immortality.
UHURA,"I,
Mudd","I'll live
forever, Captain."
UHURA,"I,
Mudd",I'll be young and beautiful.
UHURA,"I,
Mudd",Thank you.
UHURA,"I,
Mudd",I half believed it myself.
UHURA,"I,
Mudd","Thank you, kind sir."
UHURA,"I,

SCOTT,"I,
Mudd","Captain, he's here."
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd",Let go of me!
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd",Now what are you doing?
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd",What kind of a woman
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd",Harry Mudd!
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd","Oh, you bogus frat, you."
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd","You're the cause of all
this, are you?"
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd","And I stayed until that female gargantua threw me into
the transporter beams."
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd",Absolutely fantastic.
SCOTT,"I,

microvision, and a nanopulse laser."
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd",I've never seen the like before.
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd","Captain, you should see this shop!"
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd","Why, they have facilities
we've never even thought of."
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd","What did they offer you, Uhura?"
SCOTT,"I,

independent, creative thought."
SCOTT,"I,
Mudd",How does it look?
SCOTT,"I,

place, isn't it?"

listening."

really a very, very nice place, and you're all going to be here
quite probably for the rest of your lives."
MUDD,"I,

MUDD,"I,

MUDD,"I,

First."
MUDD,"I,

MUDD,"I,

MUDD,"I,

must admit, Kirk, that I still retain my eye for beauty."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","I decreed that
I should always be surrounded by it, and my decrees always come to
pass."
MUDD,"I,

identical, beautiful, compliant, obedient."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","I have a fondness for this particular model, Mister Spock, which
you, unfortunately, are ill-equipped to appreciate."
MUDD,"I,

modern industrial techniques to backward planets, making available
certain valuable patents to struggling young civilisations throughout
the galaxy."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Well, actually, Kirk, as a defender of the free enterprise
system, I found myself in a rather ambiguous conflict
as a matter of principle."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Knowledge, sir, should be free to all."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","That, sir, is an outrageous assumption."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",I sold the Denebians all the rights to a Vulcan fuel synthesiser.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",How'd you know?
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",It's typical police mentality.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",They've got no sense of humour.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",They arrested me.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Worse than that.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Do know what the penalty for fraud is on Deneb
Five?"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","The key word in your entire peroration, Mister Spock, was, death."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Barbarians.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Well, of course, I left."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",I borrowed transportation.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",The patrol reacted in a hostile manner.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",They've no respect for private property.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","They damaged the bloody
spaceship."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Well, I got away, but I couldn't navigate, so I wandered out
through unmapped space, and here I found Mudd."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Spock, you're going to love it here."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","They all talk just the way
you do."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Yes, well, right, laddybuck."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","So here I am in a planet with over
two hundred thousand hard-working, happy androids, all of whom exist
merely to serve my every whim."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",It's absolute paradise.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",They won't let me go.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",They want to study me.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","They want to learn
more about human beings."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Watch your tongue, lad."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",You're talking about Mudd the First.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Well, anyway, I ran out of ideas."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","I simply ran out of things for them
to do, and they insisted that I bring them more human beings."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","They need
human beings to serve, to study."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","So I had to promise them a prime
sample."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",A starship captain.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Bright, loyal, fearless and imaginative."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Any captain would have done.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",I was lucky to get you.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","So you are going
to take over for me here, and I can get off this rock and back to
civilisation."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","You misunderstand me, lad."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",I'm not asking you.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",I'm telling you.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",You've no choice.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Show them to their quarters.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Ah.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","That, gentlemen, is a shrine to the memory of my beloved
Stella."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Stella, my wife."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Oh, no, no, no."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Merely deserted.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","You see, gentlemen, behind every
great man there is a woman urging him on."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",And so it was with my Stella.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",She urged me on into outer space.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Not that she meant to, but with her
continual, eternal, confounded nagging."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Well, I think of her
constantly, and every time I do, I go further out into space."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","I had the androids construct a perfect replica of Stella so that
I could gaze upon her and rejoice in her absence."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Gentlemen, attend."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Stella, dear."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Shut up.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Marvellous, isn't it?"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","I finally have the last word with her, and
with you."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","They were, of course, made to my personal specifications, as
indeed were the Maisie series, the Trudie series, and particularly the
Annabel series."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Male?
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Well, I suppose they have their uses."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Immortality and eternal beauty.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","I'm so glad you enjoyed it, Doctor."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",I do so admire a man who devotes himself to knowledge.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Stubborn, Kirk."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Stubborn.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Splendid.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Splendid.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Welcome to Mudd, Mister Scott."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Didn't I tell you, Kirk?"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","I beamed a few dozen androids up to your
ship."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","They've been sending your crew to the surface for the past couple
of hours."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",They're all down now.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",There is an entire crew aboard.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",An entire crew of androids.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","They
learn very quickly, Captain."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","The fact is, I've taken over your whole
ship."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",There's nothing you can do about it.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Well, who's to stop me?"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","But now, Captain, now I have a ship of my own as fast as any in
the fleet, so how will they catch me, eh?"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Just think of it, laddybuck."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Harry Mudd with his own crew of lovelies aboard your vessel.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Think
about that."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Alice.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Afraid I won't have time to answer them.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",My bags are all packed.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","The androids will take the Enterprise out of orbit in less than twenty
four hours."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","But it's been a real pleasure having you here, Kirk."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Is
there anything I can get for you?"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","You're a stubborn fellow, aren't you?"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",But I don't mind.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","I don't
mind that at all."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Because I'll be leaving here quickly enough, and then
you can be stubborn at your own leisure."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",One last time.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Stella, dear."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Shut up!
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Alice Number 2, my little love."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Will you have my bags transported
up to the ship?"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",What?
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Why not?
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Yes, but that's what I'm saying."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Put my bags on the ship.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Now, look here."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",You can't do that!
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Now, listen."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","To serve us, you
must obey us."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Alice number One, obey me."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Put my bags on that ship!
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Take my word for it, they can."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","You're so smart, Kirk, you and this pointy-eared thinking machine
of yours."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Well, you'd better do something because I'm as anxious to get
off this ruddy rock as you are."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Oh, yes."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Captain, you sing and dance as well as anyone I've ever seen, but
what the devil are you talking about?"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Opportunity?
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Now, listen, Spock, you may be a wonderful science
officer, but believe me, you couldn't sell fake patents to your mother."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Forget it.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Captain, the kind of a wholesome, antiseptic galaxy that these
androids would run would be purgatory for a man like me."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",What can I do?
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",What do you mean?
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","(McCoy produces a hypo) Oh, now, now wait a
minute, gentlemen."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","No, what I, I, (gets injected) had in mind was
actually more in the line of a few words of sage counsel as it were."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Advice (passes out in Kirk and Scott's arms)
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","But you already have, Norman, laddy."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Human beings do not survive
on bread alone, you poor soulless creature, but on the nourishments of
liberty, for what indeed is a man without freedom?"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Naught but a
mechanism trapped in the cogwheels of eternity."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Brilliant!
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Bravo, bravo, Captain!"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Don't panic.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Women and children first.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Aye, aye!"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",(adopts a catchers pose)
MUDD,"I,

MUDD,"I,

MUDD,"I,

MUDD,"I,

MUDD,"I,
Mudd",I lied.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Listen to this carefully, Norman."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",I am lying.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Kirk, old man, I'm beginning to develop considerable respect for
you."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Would you consider entering a partnership arrangement with me?
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",I've got some ideas.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Yes.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",I've never heard of anything so revolting.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","We'll soon get to
the bottom of this."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Kirk, now what's this I hear about my having to stay here?"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",But what do I do?
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Kirk, I'm no scientist."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",How long?
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","I suppose that taking everything into consideration, as it were,
and noting all the different possibilities,
I could manage."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","And as detention sentences go, this one isn't too
uncomfortable."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",And I'm back in the galaxy again!
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","I call that unexpectedly civil of you, Captain."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Shut up!
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",I order you.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Shut up, Stella!"
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","Kirk, you can't do this."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",It's inhuman.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",No.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Number five hundred?
MUDD,"I,
Mudd","No, no, no."
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",(barely heard over the cacophony) Kirk.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",It's inhuman.
MUDD,"I,
Mudd",Mercy.
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd","You know this man, Captain?"
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd",I think we're in a lot of trouble.
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd","Oh, yes, thank you."
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd",(they pour him a cup of wine) You're Alice
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd",And you're Alice
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd","Oh, well, it doesn't make much difference."
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd",You're both lovely.
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd",What a shame you're not real.
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd","Oh, I mean real girls."
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd",You are?
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd",Harry Mudd programmed you?
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd","That unprincipled, evil-minded, lecherous kulak Harry Mudd
programmed you?"
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd",This place is even better than Leningrad.
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd","I don't know, sir, but it's a very nice gilded cage."
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd","What's next, Captain?"
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd","Thank you, gentlemen."
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd","Thank you, lovely lady."
CHEKOV,"I,
Mudd","You dance
divinely."
CHEKOV,"I,

ALICE,"I,

STELLA,"I,

STELLA,"I,

STELLA,"I,
Mudd","Nothing good, I'm sure."
STELLA,"I,

good-for-nothing"
STELLA,"I,
Mudd","Nothing, thing, thing,"
STELLA,"I,
Mudd","Harcourt Fenton Mudd, where have you been?"
STELLA,"I,
Mudd","What have you been
up to?"
STELLA,"I,

STELLA,"I,

STELLA,"I,

STELLA,"I,

Trouble With Tribbles","Odours cannot travel through the
vacuum of space."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Extremely little, Ensign."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Under dispute between the two parties since initial contact.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The
battle of Donatu Five was fought near here twenty three solar years
ago."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Inconclusive.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Undeveloped.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Sherman's Planet is claimed by both sides, our
Federation and the Klingon Empire."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",We do have the better claim.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","John Burke was the Chief Astronomer at the Royal Academy in old
Britain at the time."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Quadrotriticale is a high-yield grain, a four-lobed hybrid of
wheat and rye."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","A perennial, also, I believe."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Its root grain, triticale,
can trace its ancestry all the way back to twentieth century Canada"
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Misuse of the Priority One channels is a Federation offence.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","It would seem a logical precaution, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The Sherman's
Planet affair is of extreme importance to the Federation."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Nevertheless Captain, the Klingons would not enjoy seeing us
successfully develop Sherman's Planet."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",But not totally unexpected.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","(stroking a tribble) A most curious creature, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Its
trilling seems to have a tranquillising effect on the human nervous
system."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Fortunately, of course, I am immune to its effect."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain, may I ask where you'll be?"
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",There's something disquieting about these creatures.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Don't be insulting, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","They remind me of the lilies of the
field."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","They toil not, neither do they spin."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","But they seem to eat a
great deal."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I see no practical use for them.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","So would an ermine violin, but I see no advantage in having one."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Doctor, I am well aware of human characteristics."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I am
frequently inundated by them, but I've trained myself to put up with
practically anything."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","What is that, Doctor?"
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Doctor?
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",They do have one redeeming characteristic.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",They do not talk too much.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","If you'll excuse me, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain, I am forced to agree with the doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I've been running
computations on their rate of reproduction."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The figures are taking an
alarming direction."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","They're consuming our supplies and returning
nothing."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Surely you must have realised what would happen if you removed
the tribbles from their predator-filled environment into an environment
where their natural multiplicative proclivities would have no
restraining factors."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","By removing the tribbles from their natural habitat, you have,
so to speak, removed the cork from the bottle and allowed the genie to
escape."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",He simply could not believe his ears.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","We have already checked on the background of Mister Cyrano
Jones."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",He is a licensed asteroid locator and prospector.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","He's never
broken the law, at least not severely."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","For the past seven years, with
his one-man spaceship, he's obtained a marginal living by engaging in
the buying and selling of rare merchandise, including, unfortunately,
tribbles."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain, there are vents of that type on the space station."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",They seem to be gorged.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","One million seven hundred seventy one thousand five hundred
sixty one."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","That's assuming one tribble, multiplying with an average
litter of ten, producing a new generation every twelve hours over a
period of three days."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","And allowing for the amount of grain consumed and the volume of
the storage compartment."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Captain this tribble is dead.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",And so are these.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",The logical assumption is that there is something in the grain.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I believe that more than the word of an aggrieved Klingon
commander would be necessary for that, Mister Baris."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Remarkable.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Obviously tribbles are very perceptive creatures, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",The penalty is twenty years in a rehabilitation colony.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Seventeen point nine, to be exact."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",He'll do it.
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain, Starfleet was able to divert that
freighter."
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Based on computer analysis, of course, taking into account the
possibilities of"
SPOCK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, it was Mister Scott who performed the actual engineering."
KIRK,"The

experience and knowledge."
KIRK,"The

KIRK,"The

KIRK,"The

KIRK,"The

they are most efficient."

KIRK,"The

KIRK,"The

KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","What is
your emergency?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Lurry, you issued a Priority One distress call."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","State the
nature of your emergency."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You'll try to explain.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You'd better be prepared to do more than
that."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Kirk out.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Spock, I'll need your help."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Chekov,
maintain battle readiness."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Lieutenant Uhura, see that the transporter
room is standing by."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Lurry, if there's no emergency, why did you issue a
priority one distress call?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","And that gives you the authority to put an entire quadrant on
defence alert?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Oh.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",And this is my first officer Mister Spock.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Storage compartments?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Storage compartments?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What's quadrotriticale?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","(Lurry hands him a small
packet) Wheat."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",So what?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Spock, you've made your point."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You issued a priority one distress call for a couple of tons of
wheat?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Baris, you summoned the Enterprise without an emergency."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You'll take full responsibility for it.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Secure from general quarters.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","And beam down two, and only two,
security guards."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Have them report to Mister Lurry.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Authorise shore leave for all off-duty personnel.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Kirk out.

representative of the Federation."
KIRK,"The

storage compartments."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Storage compartments of wheat.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I guess not.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I see you didn't waste time taking your shore leave.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","(shows Chekov the packet of wheat) Mister Chekov, what do you
make of this?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Does everybody know about this wheat but me?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Ah.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Yes, what is it?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Put it on visual, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Now, that's just lovely."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Yes, Lieutenant, what is it?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Go to Red Alert.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Notify Mister Lurry.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",We'll be right up.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What is the position of the Klingon ship?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Put him on visual.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Lurry, there's a Klingon warship hanging one hundred
kilometres off your station."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Why not?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Cancel Red Alert.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",We'll beam right down.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",My dear Captain Koloth.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Shore leave?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Yes, well, I don't make those decisions."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Lurry is in
charge of those matters."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, I have the authority to act, and I'm going to use it."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","My
dear Captain Koloth, you may indeed bring your men down on shore leave,
but only twelve at a time."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","And I assure you, for every man you bring
down here, I shall have one security guard."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",There will be no trouble.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Let us both take steps to keep it that way.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Another technical journal, Scotty?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Don't you ever relax?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You running a nursery, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Did you get this at the space station?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Pipe it down here will you, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Yes, Mister Baris."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What can I do for you?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I was not aware, Mister Baris, that twelve
Klingons constitutes a swarm."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Baris, I have guards around the grain."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I have guards around the Klingons.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The only reason those guards are
there
is because Starfleet wants them there."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","As for what you want (pauses at
a look from Spock) It has been noted and logged."

KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Both.
KIRK,"The

KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",How do they?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",How do they?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",A fat tribble.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, Bones, all I can suggest is you open up a maternity ward."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","All you men going on shore leave to stay in
groups."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Avoid trouble with the Klingons.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Aren't you going on shore leave, Scotty?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I want you to go on shore leave.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Make sure that everybody stays
out of trouble."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Scotty, enjoy yourself."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I want to know who started it.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I'm waiting.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Freeman, who started
the fight?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",All right.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Chekov.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I know you.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You started it, didn't you?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Who did?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I don't know, sir."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I want to know who threw the first punch.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","All
right."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You're all confined to quarters until I find out who started it.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Dismissed.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","(the men file out) Scotty, not you."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You were supposed to
prevent trouble, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Who threw the first punch, Scotty?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Mister Scott?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You did, Mister Scott?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","What caused it, Scotty?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Must have been some insult.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You threw the first punch.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You held?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Why did Chekov want to start a fight?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","No, this is not off the record."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Is that all?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I see.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I get the picture, Scotty."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","After they said all this, that's when you hit the Klingons?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",No?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Oh, yes."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What was it they said that started the fight?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I see.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",And that's when you hit the Klingons?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You hit the Klingons because they insulted the Enterprise, not
because they"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","All right, Scotty."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Dismissed.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Scotty, you're restricted to
quarters until further notice."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Doctor McCoy, would you mind coming up to the bridge?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","(he takes a
walk around then) Lieutenant Uhura, how did all these tribbles get on
the bridge?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Explain that.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I know, but really"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Too much of anything, Lieutenant, even love, isn't necessarily a
good thing."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Get the maintenance crew to clean up the entire ship, and then
contact Mister Lurry and tell him I'm beaming down."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Have him find Cyrano Jones and hold him.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",And get these tribbles off the bridge.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Oh, really?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Just incredibly prolific.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You should sell an instruction and maintenance manual for this
thing."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","On the contrary, sir."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I think of this project as very important.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",It is you I take lightly.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",That's a serious charge.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",To whom are you referring?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Cyrano Jones, a Klingon agent?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I heard you.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What evidence do you have against Mister Jones?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Yes, yes."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Go on.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What else do you have?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Do you have any proof of that?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","People have disrupted stations before without being Klingon
agents."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Sometimes, all they need is a title, Mister Baris."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Unfortunately, disrupting a space station is not an offence."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Now, if
you'll excuse me, I have a ship to tend to."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Au revoir.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",My chicken sandwich and coffee.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","This is my chicken sandwich and
coffee."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I want these off the ship.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I don't care if it takes every man
we've got, I want them off the ship."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",How?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",And in the storage compartments.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","(goes to a table monitor) This
is Kirk."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Contact Manager Lurry and Nilz Baris.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Have them meet us near
the storage compartments."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",We're beaming down.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Come on, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Energise.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Plenty, if what I think's happened has happened."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Is that door secure?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Good.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Open it.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Here.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Let me try it.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Hundreds of thousands.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",That's assuming they got here three days ago.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Mister Baris
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Baris, I'll hold you in irons if you don't shut up."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Now he tells me.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Yes.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Bones, I want the tribbles, the grain, everything analysed."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I want to know what killed these tribbles.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Until that inquiry, I'm still the captain."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","And as Captain, I want
two things done."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","First, find Cyrano Jones, and second (as another
tribble hits him on the head) close that door."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Ah, Mister Jones, with an armful."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",A few questions.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What do you want?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",An apology?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, we'll see about that, but before I take any official
action, I'd like to know Just what happened."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Who put the tribbles in
the quadrotriticale?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What was in the grain that killed them?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Yes.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Hold on a minute.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I thought you said tribbles liked everybody.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What was in the bar?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You're right, Mister Jones."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",They don't like Klingons.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","(McCoy
enters) But they do like Vulcans."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I didn't know you had it in you.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Obviously.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Baris, they like you."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, there's no
accounting for taste."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","(and back to Darvin) They don't like you, Mister
Darvin."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I wonder why.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Bones?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I wonder what Starfleet Command will say about that.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","What about
the grain, Bones?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",They starved to death.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","In a storage compartment full of grain,
they starved to death."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Darvin, are you going to talk?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",And the tribbles had nothing to do with it?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Captain Koloth.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",About that apology.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You have six hours to get your ship out of Federation territory.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You know, I think I could learn to like tribbles."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","No, you're not."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",There's something I want to show you.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You know
what the penalty is for transporting an animal proven harmful to human
life?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",There is one thing you can do.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Pick up every tribble on the space station.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","If you do that, I'll
speak to Mister Lurry about returning your spaceship."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Consider it Job security.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You'll do it?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Good.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","That means Sherman's Planet will get its quadrotriticale
only a few weeks late."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I don't see any tribbles around here.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Bones, how did you do it?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Scotty!
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Where are the tribbles?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Of course.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Spock.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Gentlemen, I don't want to interrupt this mutual admiration
society, but I'd like to know where the tribbles are."
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Mister Scott.
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Where are the tribbles?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You used the transporter?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Where did you transport them?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Scott, you didn't transport them
into space, did you?"
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Where are they?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",(shouting) Where?
KIRK,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",(a whisper) You gave them to the Klingons?
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","One parsec, sir."
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Close enough to smell them.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I was making a little joke, sir."
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The area was first mapped by the famous Russian astronomer Ivan
Borkoff almost two hundred"
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Burke, sir?"
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I don't think so.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I'm sure it was
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Oh, Royal Academy."
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Well
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Under terms of the Organian Peace Treaty, one side or the other
must prove it can develop the planet most efficiently."
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I remember once Peter the Great had that problem like that.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",The
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Code One emergency.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",That's a disaster call.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Main phasers armed and ready, sir."
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",But there's nothing there.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Just the station.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","She wants to shop, and I thought I would help her."
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Oh, quadrotriticale."
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I've read about this, but I've never seen
any before."
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Not everyone, Captain."
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",It's a Russian invention.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","He won't bite, will he?"
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Hey!
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",He's eating my grain.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",A hundred kilometres off K7.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",It's just sitting there.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Bridge to Captain Kirk.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Baris waiting is on channel E to speak to you, sir."
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Mister Baris is coming on.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",This is vodka.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Scotch?
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",It was invented by a little old lady from Leningrad.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",That Cossack.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You heard what he called the captain.
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Mister Scott!
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","No, sir, I didn't."
CHEKOV,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I don't know, sir."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Captain?
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I'm picking up a subspace distress call.
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Priority
channel."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",It's from Space Station K7.
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",This is a Red Alert.
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Man your battle stations.
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",All hands.
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The channel's open, sir."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Transporter room, stand by."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Enterprise here.
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Yes, Captain."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",(coldly) How often do I get shore leave?
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What is it?
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Is it alive?
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",May I hold it?
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Oh, it's adorable."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What is it?
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",A tribble?
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Oh, it's purring."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Listen, it's purring."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Are you selling them?
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","If you're not going to take him, I'm going to take him."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I think
he's cute."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","All right, what are you selling them for?"
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Oh, I couldn't."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Could I?
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Message from Starfleet, Captain."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Priority channel.
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Admiral
Fitzpatrick speaking."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Captain Kirk!
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Captain Kirk!
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Sensors are picking up a Klingon battle cruiser rapidly
closing on the station."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain, I have Mister Lurry."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Security, cancel Red Alert."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Since yesterday, Doctor."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","This morning, I found out that he, I
mean she, had had babies."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Oh, Captain."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, I hadn't intended to, sir, but the tribble
had other plans."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, all right, Doctor, but if you're going to dissect it, I
don't want to know about it."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Sure, why not?"
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I think they're old enough.
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",(to all) Go ahead.
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I don't know, sir."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",They do seem to be all over the ship.
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","But they do give us something, Mister Spock."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",They give us love.
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, Cyrano Jones says a tribble is the only love that money can buy."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Yes, Captain."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Aye, aye."
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Aye.
UHURA,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Aye, aye, Captain."
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","This is Mister Lurry, manager of K7."
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I must apologise for
the distress call."
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, perhaps you better beam over."
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I'll try to explain.
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain Kirk, this is Nilz Baris."
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","He's out from Earth to take
charge of the development project on Sherman's Planet."
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Mister Spock.
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Quadrotriticale is the only earth grain that grows on Sherman's
Planet."
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",We have several tons of it here on the station.
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","It's very
important that grain gets to Sherman's Planet safely."
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Baris
thinks that Klingon agents may try to sabotage it."
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain, couldn't you at least post a couple of guards?"
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","We do
have a large number of ships passing through."
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I don't think the Klingons are planning to
attack us."
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Because at this moment the captain of the
Klingon ship is sitting right here in my office."
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain, may I speak to you a minute?"
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","(takes him aside) Look, I
don't want them here, but I don't have the authority to refuse."
LURRY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What's wrong?
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","That was my order, Captain."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",This is my assistant Arne Darvin.
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","And now Captain, I want all available security guards."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I want
them posted around the storage compartments."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Quadrotriticale is not wheat, Captain."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Of course, I wouldn't
expect you or Mister Spock to know about such things, but
quadrotriticale is a rather"
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Of course, Captain, I realise that"
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What do you mean?
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I did not misuse the Priority One channel.
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I want that grain
protected."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain Kirk, how dare you authorise a mere two men for a
project of this importance?"
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Starfleet Command
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Kirk, this station is swarming with
Klingons."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain Kirk, there are Klingon soldiers on
this station."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Now, I want you to keep that grain safe."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain Kirk, I consider your security measures a disgrace."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","In
my opinion, you have taken this important project far too lightly."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I am going to report fully to the proper authorities that you
have given free and complete access to this station to a man who is
quite probably a Klingon agent."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",To that man who just walked out of here.
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You heard me.
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","My assistant here has kept Mister Jones under close surveillance
for quite some time, and his actions have been most suspicious."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I
believe he was involved in that little altercation between your men and
the men from"
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The man is an independent scout, Captain."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","It is quite possible
he is also a Klingon spy."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",But he is after my grain!
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Gorged?
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",On my grain?
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Kirk, I am going to hold you responsible."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",There must be thousands of them.
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Kirk, you should have known."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You are responsible for turning the
development project into a total disaster."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","And I'm through being intimidated, Kirk."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You have insulted me,
you have ignored me, you've walked all over me."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You have abused your
authority, and you've rejected my requests."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","And this, this is the
result."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I'm going to hold you responsible.
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","That isn't going to do you any good, Kirk."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","This project is
ruined, and Starfleet is going to hear about it."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","And when they do, they
will have a board of inquiry and they will roast you alive."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","And I am
going to be there, Kirk, to enjoy every minute of it."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","No, Kirk."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You can't let him.
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","That will give them the wedge they
need to claim Sherman's Planet."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",A Klingon?
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Poisoned?
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I'm certain that can be arranged, Darvin."
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Guards?
BARIS,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","If you'll
excuse me, Captain."
DARVIN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Baris is the Federation Undersecretary in Charge of
Agricultural Affairs in this quadrant."
DARVIN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",The storage compartments containing the quadrotriticale.
DARVIN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Quadrotriticale!
DARVIN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Go ahead, sir."
DARVIN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Tell him.
DARVIN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well Captain, I've checked his ship's log, and it seems that he
was within the Klingon's sphere of influence less than four months ago."
DARVIN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You can't deny he's disrupted this station.
DARVIN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I have nothing to say.
DARVIN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","(Kirk thrusts the tribbles into his
face) All right, I poisoned the grain!"
DARVIN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Take them away.
DARVIN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I don't know.
DARVIN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I never saw one before in my life, and I hope I
never see one of those fuzzy miserable things again."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","(entering) Oh, excuse me."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Excuse me.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","How sad for you, my friend."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You won't find a finer stone
anywhere."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",But I have something better.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Surely you want some Antarian
glow water."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You're a difficult man to reach, but I have something from the
far reaches of the galaxy."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Surely you want
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What is it?
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Why, lovely lady, it's a tribble."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Only the sweetest creature known to man, excepting, of course,
your lovely self."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",It's only saying that it likes you.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","My friend, 10 credits apiece is a very reasonable price."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Now you
can see for yourself how much the lovely little lady appreciates the
finer things."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Sir, transporting harmful animals from one planet to another is
against regulations, or weren't you aware of that?"
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Besides, tribbles
have no teeth."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Twice nothing is still nothing.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Is that an offer or a joke?
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",That's a joke.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You're an honest man.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm
going to lessen my price to eight and a half credits."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Seven and a half.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Seven?
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","All right, you robber, six credits."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Right away.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Thief.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","That happens to be my sample, and I'll do with it as I please."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",And I please to give it to the lovely lady.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I insist.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Once this lovely little lady starts to show this precious little
darling around, you won't be able to keep up with them."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Ah, friend."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Can I offer you a charming little tribble?
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Oh.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Perhaps one of you other gents?
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Ah, friend Klingon."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Can I interest you in a harmless tribble?
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I'm sorry.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I can't understand it.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I've never seen them act this
way before."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",He's only a harmless little
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Yes.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Ah, my good friend."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","How would you like to enter another
little transaction?"
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","This time, a tribble for a spot"
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Indeed.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Oh, yes."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain Kirk, I'm mystified at your tone of
voice."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I've done nothing to warrant such severe treatment.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Of course.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What did you say?
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","If by that, you mean do they breed quickly?"
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Of course, that's
how I maintain my stock."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Breeding animals is not against regulations,
only breeding dangerous ones."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",And tribbles are not dangerous.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Precisely, and at six credits a head, well, that is, a body, it
mounts up."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Now if you'll excuse me.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","If I did, what would happen to man's search for knowledge?"
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well,
I must be tending my ship."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Au revoir.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Really, Captain Kirk, I must protest this treatment."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",They do.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I can't understand it.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The last time I saw one act this
way was at the bar."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Klingons.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Him, for one."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",(points at Korax)
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, Captain, I suppose I'm free to go now."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain, one little tribble isn't harmful."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain, you wouldn't
do a thing like that to me, now would you?"
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Would you?
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Captain Kirk.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Friend.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Friend Kirk.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Surely we can come to some
sort of mutual understanding."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","After all, my tribbles did put you wise
to the poisoned grain, and they did help you to find the Klingon agent."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You saved a lot of lives that way.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Yes?
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",It would take years.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Seventeen point nine years.
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain, you're a hard man."
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",All right!
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",All right!
JONES,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I'll do it.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I don't want any.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I told you before, and I'm telling you again
I don't want any more Spican flame gems."
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Thanks to you,
I have enough Spican flame gems to last me a lifetime."
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I use that to polish the flame gems.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Not at your price.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",That's what we're trying to decide right now.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",One credit apiece.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",All right.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I'll double my offer 2 credits.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Four credits.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",That's my offer.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Five?
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You're talking yourself out of a deal, friend."
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Six credits.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Not
a credit more."
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Done.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",When can I have them?
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, let me see, little lady."
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Six credits.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Figure a reasonable
mark-up for a reasonable profit, say ten percent mark-up."
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Ten credits.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","In fact, I'll sell you this one."
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",That'll be ten credits.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","What are you trying to do, ruin the market?"
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",A tribble.
BARMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","(starts producing tribbles from all over the place and putting
them on the bar) A tribble?"
ADMIRAL,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Captain Kirk?
ADMIRAL,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain, it is not necessary to remind you of the
importance to the Federation of Sherman's Planet."
ADMIRAL,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The key to our
winning of this planet is the grain quadrotriticale."
ADMIRAL,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The shipment of it
must be protected."
ADMIRAL,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Effective immediately, you will render any aid and
assistance which Undersecretary Baris may require."
ADMIRAL,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The safety of the
grain and the project is your responsibility."
ADMIRAL,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Starfleet out.
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Ah, my dear Captain Kirk."
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Let me assure you that my intentions are peaceful.
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","As I've
already told Mister Lurry, the purpose of my presence
is to invoke shore leave rights."
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain, we Klingons are not as luxury-minded as you Earthers."
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","We do not equip our ships with, how shall I say it, non-essentials."
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",(makes an hour-glass gesture with his hands)
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I might also add that under terms of the Organian Peace Treaty,
you cannot refuse us."
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain Kirk, there's been no formal declaration of hostilities
between our two respective governments."
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","So, naturally, our relationship
will be a peaceful one."
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Of course.
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Captain Kirk!
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",An official apology addressed to the Klingon High Command.
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I
expect you to assume full responsibility for the persecution of Klingon
nationals in this quadrant."
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Yes.
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You've harassed my men.
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You've treated them like
criminals."
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You've been most uncourteous, Captain Kirk."
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","If you wish to
avoid a diplomatic incident"
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Mister Spock, as far as Sherman's Planet is concerned, Captain
Kirk has already given it to us."
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain Kirk, before you go on, may I make a request?"
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Can you get those things out of here?
KOLOTH,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Yes?
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",We have been in space for five months.
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","What we choose as
recreation is our own business."
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Get it away from me.
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Get out of here with that parasite.
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Take it away!
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The Earthers like those fuzzy things, don't they?"
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",No.
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I just remembered.
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","There is one Earthman who doesn't remind
me of a Regulan blood worm."
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",That's Kirk.
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","A Regulan blood worm is soft
and shapeless, but Kirk isn't soft."
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Kirk may be a swaggering,
overbearing, tin-plated dictator with delusions of godhood, but he's
not soft."
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","That's right, and if I think that Kirk is a Denebian slime
devil, well that's my opinion too."
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Of course, I'd say that Captain Kirk deserves his ship."
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","We like
the Enterprise."
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","We, we really do."
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","That sagging old rust bucket is
designed like a garbage scow."
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Half the quadrant knows it.
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","That's why
they're learning to speak Klingonese."
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You're right, I should."
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I didn't mean to say that the Enterprise
should be hauling garbage."
KORAX,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I meant to say that it should be hauled away
as garbage."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Aye.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I am relaxing.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I'll tell them before they go, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Why, no, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","But, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Uh, no, thanks."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","When are you going to get off that milk diet, lad?"
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Where I come from, that's soda pop."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",This is a drink for a man.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Aye.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Easy, lad."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You ought to be more forgiving.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Take it easy, lad."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Everybody's entitled to an opinion.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Don't do it, mister, and that's an order."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Forget it.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",It's not worth fighting for.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","We're big enough to take
a few insults."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Now, drink your drink."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Laddie, don't you think you should rephrase that?"
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Um.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I did, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","They insulted us, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Aye, it was."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Aye.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Chekov wanted to, but I held him back."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, the Klingon, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Is this off the record?
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, Captain, the Klingons called you, uh a tin-plated,
overbearing, swaggering dictator with delusions of godhood."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","No, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",They also compared you with a Denebian slime devil.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",And then they said you
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Yes, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","No, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","No, I didn't."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You told us to avoid trouble.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",And I didn't see that it was worth fighting about.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","After all,
we're big enough to take a few insults."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Aren't we?
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","They called the Enterprise a garbage scow, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Yes, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, sir, this was a matter of pride."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","(big grin) Yes, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Thank you, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","That'll give me a chance to
catch up on my technical journals."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","They're into the machinery, all right, and they're probably in
all the other food processors too."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Probably through one of the air vents.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Oh, er, Captain, it was really Mister Spock's recommendation."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I used the transporter, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Aye.
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Captain Kirk, that'd be inhuman."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I gave them a good home, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I gave them to the Klingons, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Before they went into warp, I transported the whole
kit and caboodle into their engine room, where they'll be no tribble at
all."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","How long have you had that thing, Lieutenant?"
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Well, in that case, you got a bargain."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Lieutenant, do you mind if I take one of these down to the lab
to see what makes it tick?"
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I won't harm a hair on its head, wherever that is."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Hi, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Let me guess.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Klingons?
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Baris?
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Just one.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","You noticed that, huh?"
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Here.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",This ought to take care of it.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I haven't figured that out yet, but I can tell you this much."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Almost fifty percent of the creature's metabolism is geared for
reproduction."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Do you know what you get if you feed a tribble too much?
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",No.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",You get a bunch of hungry little tribbles.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","What's the matter, Spock?"
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Don't tell me you've got a feeling.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Does everything have to have a practical use for you?
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","They're
nice, soft, and furry, and they make a pleasant sound."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","It's a human characteristic to love little animals, especially
if they're attractive in some way."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Spock, I don't know too much about these little tribbles yet,
but there's one thing that I have discovered."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I like them better than I like you.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Yes?
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",What's that?
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Yes?
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Did you want to see me, Jim?"
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Don't look at me.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","It's the
tribbles who are breeding."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","If we don't get them off this ship, we're
going to be hip deep in them."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The nearest thing I can figure out is they're born pregnant,
which seems to be quite a time saver."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","And from my observations, it seems they're bisexual, reproducing
at will."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","And, brother, have they got a lot of will."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Jim, I think I've got it."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","All we have to do is quit feeding
them."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","We quit feeding them, they stop breeding."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",A lot of them are dead.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","A lot of them are alive, but they won't
be for long."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I haven't figured out what keeps them alive yet.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","All right, if I
find out anything, I'll let you know."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",(leaves)
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",(scanning him) Heartbeat is all wrong.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",His body temperature is.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Jim, this man is a Klingon."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Oh, yes."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",It was poisoned.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Yes.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",It's been impregnated with a virus.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The virus turns into an
inert material in the bloodstream."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","The more the organism eats, the more
inert matter is built up."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","So after two or three days, they reached a
point where they couldn't take in enough nourishment to survive."
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",That is essentially it.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",And you won't find a tribble on this entire ship.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",I cannot take credit for another man's work.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Scotty did it.
MCCOY,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Tell him, Spock."
FREEMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Say, Lieutenant."
FREEMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Seeing as you're giving them away, can I have
one?"
FREEMAN,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","I don't know, sir."
KLINGON,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Frankly, I never liked Earthers."
KLINGON,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","They remind me of Regulan
blood worms."
GUARD,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","Yes, sir."
GUARD,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",Nothing could get in.
GUARD,"The
Trouble With Tribbles","It's not working, sir."
GUARD,"The
Trouble With Tribbles",It seems to be stuck.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"No doubt about it, Captain."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,The space debris comes from the survey vessel SS Beagle.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Portions of the antimatter nacelles, personal belongings."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Captain, no signs of bodies whatsoever."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"It would have come from planet four, star system eight nine two, directly ahead."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,SS Beagle.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Small class four stardrive vessel.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Crew of forty seven, commanded by."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Jim, I believe you knew him."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Captain R M Merik.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Different in shape only, Captain."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,The proportion of land to water is exactly as on your Earth.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Density five point five, diameter seven nine one seven at the equator, atmosphere seventy eight percent nitrogen, twenty one percent oxygen."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Again, exactly like Earth."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,I also picked up indications of large cities.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"No sign of atomic power as yet, but far enough along for radio communications, power transportation, an excellent road system."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Television was the colloquial term.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Captain, the one described as the barbarian is also listed here."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Flight officer William B. Harrison of the SS Beagle.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,At least there were some survivors down there.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"But hardly more practical, captain."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Close to the city we located, but not populated."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,We should not be observed.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,This atmosphere is remarkably similar to your twentieth century.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Moderately industrialised pollution containing substantial amounts of carbon monoxide and partially consumed hydrocarbons.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Yes, I believe that was the term."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"I had no idea you were that much of a historian, Doctor."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Then the Prime Directive is in full force, Captain?"
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"I fail to see the humour in that situation, Doctor."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Complete Earth parallel.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,The language here is English.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,There would seem to be evidence to that effect.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,I call them ears.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Never.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Colloquial twentieth-century English.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,An amazing parallel.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Sir, we came here looking for some friends, forty seven of them who were stranded here some six years ago."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,They wore clothing similar to ours.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Have you heard of such men?
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"(brings over a magazine) Captain, I thought you might find this interesting."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Captain, a logical question, if I may."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Septimus, how many years ago did Merikus become your first citizen?"
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Curious, Captain, the similarity in names."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Were you told why Merik was dropped from the Space Academy?
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Why, Doctor?"
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Even more fascinating.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Slavery evolving into an institution with guaranteed medical payments, old-age pensions."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Doctor, if I were able to show emotion, your new infatuation with that term would begin to annoy me."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Really, Doctor, I had no idea they were trained."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Watching you, I assumed it was trial and error."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Interesting, and given a conservative empire, quite understandable."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"I said I understood it, Doctor."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,I find the checks and balances of this civilisation quite illuminating.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"They do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three world wars, Doctor."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Situations quite familiar to the six million who died in your first world war, the eleven million who died in your second, the thirty seven million who died in your third."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Shall I go on?
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Quite correct.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,I tell you I'm well able to defeat you.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,I do not want to injure you.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Need any help, Doctor?"
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Such emotions are foreign to me, Doctor."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,I'm merely testing the strength of the door.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Doctor, I am seeking a means of escape."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Will you please be brief?
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Yes, that's quite true."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Oh, yes."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,You humans have that emotional need to express gratitude.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"You're welcome, I believe, is the correct response."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"However, Doctor, you must remember I am entirely motivated by logic."
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"The loss of our ship's surgeon, whatever I think of his skill, would mean a reduction in the efficiency of the Enterprise and therefore"
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"Really, Doctor?"
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,What did they do to you?
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,I wish we could have examined that belief of his more closely.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,It seems illogical for a sun worshiper to develop a philosophy of total brotherhood.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,Sun worship is usually a primitive superstition religion.
SPOCK,Bread And Circuses,"It will replace their imperial Rome, but it will happen in their twentieth century."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Missing for six years, and now this junk in space."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Then whatever destroyed the ship, the crew was able to get off safely."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Navigator, compute the present drift of the wreckage."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Mister Spock, assuming that the wreckage drifted at the same speed and direction for the past six years?"
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Standard orbit around the planet.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,There may be survivors there.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Yes, at the academy."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,He was dropped in his fifth year.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,He went into the merchant service.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Put it on the screen.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Yes, similar."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"But the land masses and oceans are quite different, however."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Exactly in some ways, different in others."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,What era?
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Put it on the screen.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Slaves and gladiators.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"What are we seeing, a twentieth-century Rome?"
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Ready the transporter room, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,We're beaming down.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"You could have selected a more convenient place, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,The SS Beagle was the first ship to make a survey of this star sector when it disappeared.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,No identification of self or mission.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,No interference with the social development of said planet.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Let's go.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"I think he means it, Spock."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,We come from another province.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,We come from a place that's quite some journey from here.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,I doubt if you've heard
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Do we look like any Romans you ever saw ?
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Our people don't believe in slavery.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Wait.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,I can prove we're telling the truth.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,A small device.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,I'll take it out slowly.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,(his communicator) Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Come in.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Scotty, lock in on my transmission beam."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Scan us.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Including ourselves, how many of us are there?"
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Good, Scotty."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Continue scanning.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,We'll maintain transmission.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Kirk out.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"The Enterprise is our ship, somewhere at sea."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,That's all I can tell you.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"If it isn't sufficient, you will have to kill us."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Perhaps you've heard, let's say, an impossible story or a rumour of men who came from the sky or from other worlds."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,The stars.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Yes, of course."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Spock?
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,(looking at a car advert) The Jupiter Eight.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Conventional internal combustion engine.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,You were right about the smog.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,But the Jupiter Eight?
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Mars toothpaste.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Neptune bath salts.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Septimus, we need your help."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,We must go into the city.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,We know that one of our missing friends was seen there recently.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,We can't do that.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Perhaps you know his name.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Merik.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Captain Merik.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Yes.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,He's the leader of our friends.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,That doesn't sound like the same man.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Septimus, wherever we may be from, you must believe that it is one of our most important laws that none of us interfere with the affairs of others."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"If Captain Merik is Merikus, then he has violated that law, and he must be taken away and punished."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Will you help us get to the truth of all this?
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,He failed a psycho-simulator test.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,All it takes is a split second of indecision.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Hardly the type to become a political strongman.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Are you a slave, Flavius?"
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Then you heard the word of the sun?
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,There are many things I'd like to know
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Tell Merikus I'd like to see him.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Tell him it's Jim Kirk.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Perhaps a friend.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Well, if I am a friend and you don't tell him, do you really want to risk that?"
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"But if there have been slaves for over 2,000 years, hasn't there always been discontent, runaways?"
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,I'm not sure they're sure.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"When the slaves began to worship the sun, they became discontent again."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,When did all this happen?
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"You go on believing it, Flavius."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,All men are brothers.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Three against three.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,We may never get a better chance.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,(looking at McCoy) I doubt if he'll get very far.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,He feels ill.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"All right, but he'll double over before we get very far."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,(Spock and Kirk take McCoy's arms.)
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Let's go.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Captain Merik, isn't it ?"
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,I agree.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,McCoy.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"All right, what happened?"
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Go on.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,What happened to your crew?
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Did they voluntarily beam, come ashore?"
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,What happened to your crew?
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"My world, proconsul, is my vessel, my oath, my crew."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,What happened to your vessel you've explained.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,What happened to your oath is obvious.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,You sent your own men into the arena?
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Do you really believe I could be made to order my own people down?
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Scotty, if you have a fix."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"(guns are pointed at his head) Stand by, Scotty."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Yet on the other hand, my chief engineer's standing by for a message."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,If I brought down a hundred of them armed with phasers
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Scotty.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Sorry to keep you waiting.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Condition Green, all's well."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Kirk out.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,The rules.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"If Spock should finish his man off first, would he be able to help"
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Proconsul, in some parts of the galaxy I have seen forms of entertainment that makes this look like a folk dance."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,I've had to select men to die before so that others could be saved.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,It won't work.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Whatever he has in mind, whatever tricks."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"You hear that, Proconsul?"
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,It won't work.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,I'm not co-operating.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"I may die, but you won't get any entertainment out of it."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Very good.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,(he tries a grape) Excellent.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,I've been in some strange worlds with strange customs.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Perhaps this is considered torture here.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,You'll be the first to know.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Nothing except perhaps an explanation.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,I appreciate that.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Of course.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,I thank you.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,And my friends?
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,I've heard it was similar.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Stand back.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Obsolete, but effective."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,They threw me a few curves.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,No time to explain.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"And strong personal feelings, he obeyed the Prime Directive."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,His temporary blackout of the city below resulted in no interference with the society and yet saved the lives of myself and the landing party.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Gentlemen.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Caesar and Christ.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,They had them both.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,And the word is spreading only now.
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Wouldn't it be something to watch, to be a part of?"
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,To see it happen all over again?
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,"Mister Chekov, take us out of orbit."
KIRK,Bread And Circuses,Ahead warp factor one.
CHEKOV,Bread And Circuses,"Computed and on the board, sir."
CHEKOV,Bread And Circuses,"Only one sixteenth parsec away, Captain."
CHEKOV,Bread And Circuses,We should be there in seconds.
CHEKOV,Bread And Circuses,"Coming up on the planet, captain."
CHEKOV,Bread And Circuses,"Definitely class M, somewhat similar to Earth."
CHEKOV,Bread And Circuses,That may take some time.
CHEKOV,Bread And Circuses,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,Bread And Circuses,"Captain, both amplitude and frequency modulation being used."
UHURA,Bread And Circuses,I think I can pick up something visual.
UHURA,Bread And Circuses,It's a news broadcast using a system I think they once called video.
UHURA,Bread And Circuses,Aye.
UHURA,Bread And Circuses,"Transmission lost, sir."
UHURA,Bread And Circuses,Shall I try to get it back?
UHURA,Bread And Circuses,"I'm afraid you have it all wrong, Mister Spock, all of you."
UHURA,Bread And Circuses,"I've been monitoring some of their old-style radio waves, the empire spokesman trying to ridicule their religion."
UHURA,Bread And Circuses,But he couldn't.
UHURA,Bread And Circuses,Don't you understand?
UHURA,Bread And Circuses,It's not the sun up in the sky.
UHURA,Bread And Circuses,It's the Son of God.
VOICE,Bread And Circuses,Today police rounded up still another group of dissidents.
VOICE,Bread And Circuses,"Authorities are as yet unable to explain these fresh outbreaks of treasonable disobedience by well-treated, well-protected, intelligent slaves."
VOICE,Bread And Circuses,Now turning to the world of sports and bringing you the taped results of the arena games last night.
VOICE,Bread And Circuses,(a sword fight) The first heat involved amateurs.
VOICE,Bread And Circuses,They're petty thieves from City Prison.
VOICE,Bread And Circuses,"Conducted, however, with traditional weapons, it provided some amusement for a few moments."
VOICE,Bread And Circuses,"In the second heat, a slightly more professional display in the spirit of our splendid past, when gladiator Claudius Marcus killed the last of the barbarians, William B. Harrison, in an excellent example of"
VOICE,Bread And Circuses,Begin!
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,The word was smog.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"I am not, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,I was simply trying to stop you from giving us a whole lecture on the subject.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"Jim, is there anything at all we know about this planet?"
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"No references to space, or the fact that there are other worlds, or more advanced civilisations."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"One, just once, I'd like to be able to land someplace and say, Behold, I am the Archangel Gabriel."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Naturally.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"You could hardly claim to be an angel with those pointed ears, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,But say you landed someplace with a pitchfork.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"For which we are grateful, for we are men of peace ourselves."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"Well, if you're speaking of worships of sorts, we represent many beliefs."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Odd that these people should worship the sun.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"Because, my dear Mister Spock, it is illogical."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Rome had no sun worshipers.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Why should they parallel Rome in every way except one?
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"Quite logical, I'd say, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Just as it's logical that twentieth-century Rome would use television to show its gladiator contests or name a new car the Jupiter Eight.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,What term?
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Logic?
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"Medical men are trained in logic, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,I do?
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"No, I think I can walk."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,I'll try.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Are you out of your head?
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Next he'll be telling us he prefers it over Earth history.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"They have slavery, gladiatorial games, despotism."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,You must know that's impossible.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Starfleet regulations
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Jim.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Must you always be so blasted honest?
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,I am defending myself!
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Whatever gave you that idea?
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"You tell him, buster."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"Of all the completely ridiculous, illogical questions I ever heard in my life!"
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"Angry, Mister Spock, or frustrated, perhaps?"
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,For the fifteenth time.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Spock.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"Spock, I know we've had our disagreements."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Maybe they're jokes.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,I don't know.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"As Jim says, we're not often sure ourselves sometimes, but what I'm trying to say is"
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"Well, what I'm trying to say is you saved my life in the arena."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"I'm trying to thank you, you pointed-eared hobgoblin!"
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"Do you know why you're not afraid to die, Spock?"
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,You're more afraid of living.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Each day you stay alive is just one more day you might slip and let your human half peek out.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"That's it, isn't it?"
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Insecurity.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"Why, you wouldn't know what to do with a genuine, warm, decent feeling."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,I know.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"I'm worried about Jim, too."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,Jim!
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"What happened, Jim?"
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,"Captain, I see on your report Flavius was killed."
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,I am sorry.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,I liked that huge sun worshiper.
MCCOY,Bread And Circuses,A philosophy of total love and total brotherhood.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Don't move!
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Hands in the air!
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"I said, don't move!"
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Who are you?
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,(to Spock) Where are you from?
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,What do you call those?
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Are you trying to be funny?
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Uniforms.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Probably some new Praetorian guard unit.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"I should kill you here, but Septimus would probably be displeased."
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Move.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Move!
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"I didn't harm them, Septimus, as much as I wanted to."
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,There is only one true belief!
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Roman butchers, sent here by the first citizen."
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,A Roman lie.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,We must kill them.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Septimus, I know killing is evil, but sometimes it's necessary."
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"But they've located us, our hiding place."
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,It's better to kill a few of them than all of us.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Almost six.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,I was there when he became lord of the games.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"If he is your friend, you are no friends of ours."
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,We'll wait here until dark.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,You are barbarians indeed not to know of Flavius Maximus.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"For seven years, I was the most successful gladiator in this province."
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Yes.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,The words of peace and freedom.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,It wasn't easy for me to believe.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,I was trained to fight.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"But the words, the words are true."
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Long ago there were rebellions, but they were suppressed."
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"And with each century, the slaves acquired more rights under the law."
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"They received rights to medicine, the right to government payments in their old age, and they slowly learned to be content."
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Are they enemies, Captain?"
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Long ago.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Perhaps as long ago as the beginning of the empire.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"The message of the sun, that all men are brothers, was kept from us."
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Perhaps I'm a fool to believe it.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,It does often seem that man must fight to live.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,I will not fight.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,I'm a Brother of the Sun.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"I don't mind fighting, but why you?"
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,At least defend yourself.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Not like that, you fool."
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,Hold your weapon higher.
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,(rushing into the arena) Murderers!
FLAVIUS,Bread And Circuses,"If you want death, fight me!"
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,"(a very old man with a gentle way of speaking) Keep always in your mind, Flavius, that our way is peace."
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Oh?
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Are you Children of the Sun?
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Then are you slaves like ourselves?
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,No.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,"Tell me the empire has a device like that, Flavius, and you may kill them."
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,"Otherwise, accept them as friends."
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,"No, Captain."
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,I'm sure I would have heard of the arrival of other men like you.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,There are no other worlds.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Lights shining through from heaven.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,It is where the sun is.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Blessed be the sun.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Taken from the names of false gods.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,"When I was a senator, I worshiped them too, but I heard the words of the sun."
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,I became a Brother.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,"For that, they made me a slave."
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,My advice to you is to leave.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Go back where you came from.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Merikus?
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Merikus is first citizen.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Butcher.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Perhaps five years.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,First I must discuss it with the others.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,We have decided.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Flavius will guide you.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,We will provide you with suitable clothing.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,"I caution you, take great care."
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,The police are everywhere.
SEPTIMUS,Bread And Circuses,May the blessings of the sun be upon you.
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,"Scott here, Captain."
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,"Scanning, sir."
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,"Twelve, Captain."
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,Bridge.
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,Scott here.
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,"We were becoming concerned, Captain."
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,You were a bit overdue.
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,"But they have used the code term Condition Green, which means they're in trouble."
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,But it also prohibits my taking any action.
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,"(ends log entry) Mister Chekov, pinpoint power source locations."
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,"Type, power, load factors, and how much our beams will have to pull to overload them."
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,"Let it take time, lad."
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,"They're in trouble, and I'm under orders not to interfere."
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,"However, no order can stop me from frightening them."
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,"It may do no good, but it may suggest to someone just what a starship can really do."
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,Aye.
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,"Now, Mister Chekov."
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,Activate.
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,Ready to beam up three.
SCOTT,Bread And Circuses,"Thank you, Captain."
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Hold!
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Don't move!
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Hands in the air!
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,"You have been too long absent from the games, Flavius."
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,The first citizen will be pleased.
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Runaway slaves are always welcome.
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,"(removes Spock's hat) No, not slaves."
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Barbarians.
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,It's been a long time since I've watched barbarians die in the arena.
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,The first citizen?
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Why would he bother with arena bait like you?
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Perhaps?
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Flavius.
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Your friends are waiting for you.
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,You've already been matched for the morning games.
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Come.
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,"Put a sword in your hand, and you'll fight."
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,"I know you, Flavius, you're as peaceful as a bull."
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,You three come with us.
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,No talking.
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Outside.
MAXIMUS,Bread And Circuses,Outside!
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"(blue eyed, red haired) Well done, Jim."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,(Armed guards appear.)
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,I'm afraid it isn't that easy.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,They've been handling slaves here for two thousand years.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"Yes, it's me."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"This is our Proconsul, Claudius Marcus."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,This way.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"Your friends, too."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"There's lots to talk about, lots to explain."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,Don't judge me before you know the facts.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"Come on, we can talk freely here."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,The Proconsul knows who and what we are.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,You can leave us.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"Well, a celebration."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,A meeting of old friends.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,This other is your ship's surgeon?
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,It's a pity we can't let him loose in our hospitals.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"Our level of medicine would improve immeasurably, I'm sure."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"We had meteor damage, Jim."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"I went ashore with a landing party to look for iridium ore for repairs, and I met this gentleman."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,He convinced me it would be unfair to this world to carry word of their existence elsewhere.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,So I made the decision to stay.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"This is an ordered world, Jim, a conservative world based on time-honoured Roman strengths and virtues."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"There's been no war here for over four hundred years, Jim."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"Could, let's say, your land of that same era make that same boast?"
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,I think you can see why they don't want to have their stability contaminated by dangerous ideas of other ways and other places.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"And as for my men, those that were able to adapt to this world are still alive."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,Those who couldn't adapt are dead.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"That's the way it is with life everywhere, isn't it?"
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"Just as I did, Jim, you're going to order your own people ashore."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"They're going to be arriving soon, anyway, Jim."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"A recon party, then a rescue party, then another rescue party."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,I had less men.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,It added up the same.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"Jim, you've already started a message."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,Your engineer's waiting.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,What are you going to do?
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"Ah, that was stupid, Jim."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,This is not an Academy training test.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,This is for real.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,They're taking you to die.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,Most of my men went the same way.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,I hoped I would feel it less with yours.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,Maybe now you understand why I gave in.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"The Romans have always been the strongest, and they've had practice for over two thousand years in enslaving men, using them, killing them."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"He commands not just a spaceship, Proconsul, but a starship."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,A very special vessel and crew.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,I tried for such a command.
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"It's your decision, Proconsul."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"No, Proconsul."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,"(into communicator) Starship, lock in on this."
MERIK,Bread And Circuses,Three to beam
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,But it was exciting.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,They'd do well in the arena.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,But this is no place for a reunion.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Prepare food for our friends.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,They've come from a great distance.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,A great distance indeed.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"So, this is a Vulcan."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Interesting.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"From what I've heard, I wish I had fifty of you for the arena."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Come.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,You must be hungry.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Gentlemen?
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Oh, try the sparrow broiled in garum."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Delicious.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Or perhaps some of this roast kid.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Lovely thing, isn't she?"
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Contamination.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Can't risk that.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Oh, you'll understand as you learn more about us."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Interesting.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"And you, Captain, which world do you prefer?"
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Are designed to circumvent any such order.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"There may be over four hundred men on your ship, Captain, but they can be brought down if it's handled properly."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Say, a few at a time."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"You see, I have the advantage of a trained ship captain to tell me what is and what is not possible."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Your communicator, Captain Kirk."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Now do save us all a lot of unnecessary trouble and issue the appropriate orders.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"I believe this, Captain."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,That you would do almost anything rather than see these two dear friends put slowly to death.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Very wise of you, Captain."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,No point in sending up bullet-ridden corpses.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"I do hope so, for your sake."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Now, Captain, what are you going to order your men to do?"
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"you could probably defeat the combined armies of our entire empire, and violate your oath regarding noninterference with other societies."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,I believe you all swear you'll die before you'd violate that directive.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Am I right?
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"But on the other hand, why even bother to send your men down?"
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"From what I understand, your vessel could lay waste to the entire surface of the world."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Oh, but there's that Prime Directive in the way again."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Can't interfere.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Order your officers to come down.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Guards, take them."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Prepare them for the games.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Question, Captain?"
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,We believe men should fight their own battles.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Only the weak will die.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,My word as a Roman.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Ready to order your men down, Captain?"
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Quite true, Captain Kirk."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,The games have always strengthened us.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Death becomes a familiar pattern.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,We don't fear it as you do.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Admit it.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"You find these games frightening, revolting."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Certain this isn't different, Captain?"
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Those are your men dying, not strangers."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"You're a clever liar, Captain Kirk."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Merikus was a spaceship captain.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,I've observed him thoroughly.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Your species has no such strength.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,I see no evidence of superiority.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"They fight no better than your men did, Merikus."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Perhaps not as well.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Your opinion, Merikus?"
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"After all, they're like yourself."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Your opinion, Captain Kirk?"
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Would you like me to kill them now?
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,An easy death?
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Then you'd gladly accept whatever happens to you.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Take them back to their cage.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Well, it won't go that easily for them, Captain, nor for you."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Take him to my quarters.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Captain.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,(Kirk wakes with a start) I'm sorry I was detained.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Should we have our little talk now?
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,So far on this planet we've kept you rather busy.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,I don't wonder you slept through the afternoon.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"By the way, one of the communicators we took from you is missing."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Was it my pretty Drusilla by any chance?
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,See if he has it.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Not that I would have punished her.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,I would have blamed you.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"You're a Roman, Kirk, or you should have been."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,It's not on his person?
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,I am sorry I was detained.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,I trust there was nothing further you required?
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Because you're a man, I owe you that."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"You must die shortly, and because you are a man (pauses) Would you leave us, Merik?"
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,The thoughts of one man to another cannot possibly interest you.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Because you are a man, I gave you some last hours as a man."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Unfortunately, we must demonstrate that defiance is intolerable."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,But I've learned to respect you.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"I promise you, you will die easily, quickly."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"When their time comes, the same of course."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Guards.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Take him to the arena.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Oh, we've pre-empted fifteen minutes on the early show for you."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,In full colour.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,We guarantee you a splendid audience.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,You may not understand because you're centuries beyond anything as crude as television.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Make it a quick, single thrust."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"Guards, don't let him escape!"
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Guards!
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Hold!
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,We're in each other's line of fire.
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,"I pity you, Captain Merik, but at least watch and see how men die."
CLAUDIUS,Bread And Circuses,Swords only!
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,"Live and direct from City Arena, and in colour, we bring you Name the Winner, brought to you tonight by your Jupiter Eight dealers from coast to coast."
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,"In just a moment, tonight's first heat."
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,"We're in a taped commercial, Proconsul."
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,"Forty seconds, then we'll be back live."
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,Stand by.
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,Ten seconds.
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,"And first tonight, ladies and gentlemen, a surprise extra."
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,"In the far corner, a pair of highly aggressive barbarians."
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,"Strong, intelligent, with strange ways, and I'm sure full of a lot of surprises."
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,"And facing them, two favorites here from previous encounters, Achilles and Flavius."
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,(The canned applause is turned up by a bored sound effects man) Victory or death?
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,And for which of them?
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,"Well, ladies and gentlemen, you know as much about that at this moment as I do because this is your programme."
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,You name the winner.
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,"Flavius may be getting off to a slow start, but he's never disappointed this crowd."
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,A close one.
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,The barbarian with the pointed ears seems to be in trouble.
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,"Before tonight's first heat, a simple execution."
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,Stay tuned to this channel.
ANNOUNCER,Bread And Circuses,There's a lot of excitement coming your way.
ACHILLES,Bread And Circuses,"Fight, barbarian!"
ACHILLES,Bread And Circuses,Stop running.
ACHILLES,Bread And Circuses,Fight.
ACHILLES,Bread And Circuses,"Fight, you pointed-ear freak!"
MASTER,Bread And Circuses,"Fight, you two."
MASTER,Bread And Circuses,"You bring this network's ratings down, Flavius, and we'll do a special on you."
MASTER,Bread And Circuses,"A clear foul, Proconsul."
MASTER,Bread And Circuses,Your decision?
MASTER,Bread And Circuses,Don't move.
MASTER,Bread And Circuses,You'll only die harder.
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,"I was told to wait for you and provide wine, food, whatever you wish."
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,I am Proconsul's slave Drusilla.
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,Although for this evening.
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,(pause) For this evening I was told I am your slave.
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,Command me.
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,What will not work?
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,We're alone.
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,Please believe me.
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,I've never lied to one who owns me.
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,I was concerned.
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,I am ordered to please you.
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,Torture?
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,I do not understand.
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,I do not wish to see you tortured in any way.
DRUSILLA,Bread And Circuses,"(she kisses him) At the first sign of pain, you will tell me?"
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Dress uniforms, spit and polish."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to stand this.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,I feel like my neck's in a sling.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Sure.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"A formal reception tonight, a hundred and fourteen delegates aboard for two weeks, thirty two of them ambassadors, (Spock joins them) half of them mad at the other half, and the whole lot touchier than a raw antimatter pile over this Coridan question."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,How does that Vulcan salute go?
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,That hurts worse than the uniform.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Ambassador.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Mister Ambassador, I understand you had retired before this conference was called."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Forgive my curiosity, but as a doctor, I'm interested in Vulcan physiology."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Isn't it unusual for a Vulcan to retire at your age?
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"After all, you're only a hundred and two."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Spock, I've always suspected that you were a little more human than you let on."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Mrs. Sarek, I know about the rigorous training of the Vulcan youth, but tell me, did he ever run and play like the human children, even in secret?"
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Sehlat?
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,A teddy bear?
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,A teddy bear.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,His neck was broken.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,By an expert.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Well, from the nature and location of the break, I'd say the killer knew exactly where to apply pressure to snap the neck instantly."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Interesting?
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Spock, do you realise that makes your father the most likely suspect?"
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"His neck was broken, Mister Ambassador, by what Spock describes as tal-shaya."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"It's difficult to say with Vulcan physiology, but I believe it's something to do with his cardiovascular system."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,I don't know that yet either.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"As far as I can tell from instrument readings, our prime suspect has a malfunction in one of the heart valve."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,It's similar to a heart attack in a human.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"But with Vulcan physiology, it's impossible to tell without an operation."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Mrs. Sarek, has he had any previous attacks?"
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,I'm not sure.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,It's tough enough on a human.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"On a Vulcan, an ordinary operation's out of the question."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Well, I'm glad somebody's asking me something around here."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Well, the procedure they're discussing would require tremendous amounts of blood for the patient."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Yes.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Yes, I'd say that's rare."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Even you couldn't give that much blood, Spock."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,It would kill you.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Mrs. Sarek, you must understand the chances are extremely small to find a way to produce sufficient T-negative blood."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"I see it, Spock, but that was a Rigelian."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Similar is not good enough.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,It's still experimental.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Spock, we would need such great amounts of blood that, even if the drug worked on the Vulcans as well as a Rigelian, which I'm doubtful, it would still drain Sarek to a critical level."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Plus the fact I've never operated on a Vulcan before.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Oh, I've studied the anatomical types."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,I know where all the organs are.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,But that's a lot different from actual surgical experience.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"So if I don't kill him with the operation, the drug probably will."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,A chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of blood in the body.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,It's only experimental.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,It places a tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"In Sarek's condition, the stimulant would kill him."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,What has that got
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,It could damage you internally.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,It could kill you.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"I'm sorry, Spock."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,I can't sanction it.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,It's a bad wound.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Punctured left lung.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"A centimetre or so lower, it'd have gone through the heart."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Spock, your father is much worse."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,There's no longer a choice.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,I have to operate immediately.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,We can begin as soon as you're prepared.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,What?
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,You can turn command over to Scotty.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Now let that be a lesson to you.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Just lie there and be happy you're still alive.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Not good.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,If I could only operate.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,I was.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"When you became injured, Spock assumed command."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"He's going to stay there until you're back on your feet, even if it costs Sarek his life."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Regulations.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Jim, if you stand, you could start to bleed again."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"I've certified him physically fit, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Now since I have an operation to perform and both of us are required
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"Readings, Nurse."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,I wish I knew whether that was good or bad.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Initiate sterile field.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Where do you think you're going?
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,My patients don't walk out in the middle of an operation.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,So is your father's life.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"One more like that, and I'm going to lose both these men."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Cardio-stimulate.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Then get me that old portable cardio-stimulator.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Call engineering and have sickbay systems put on priority.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Are you quite through shaking the ship around?
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"I don't mind telling you, you sure make it difficult for a surgeon trying"
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,That pig-headed Vulcan stamina.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,I couldn't have pulled them through without it.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Orion?
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"If you keep arguing with your kindly family doctor, you're going to spend your next ten days right here."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"If you co-operate, you'll be out in two."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"You are at your station, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Shut up.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,(to Kirk) Shh.
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,Shh!
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,"(to camera) Well, what do you know?"
MCCOY,Journey to Babel,I finally got the last word.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,The Vulcans are the last delegates we have to pick up.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"As soon as we get them aboard, we'll be able to relax."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Kirk here.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Bring them aboard, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Captain James Kirk.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"My First Officer, Commander Spock."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Thank you.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Chief Medical Officer Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Our pleasure, madam."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,As soon as you're settled I'll arrange a tour of the ship.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Mister Spock will conduct you.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"As you wish, Ambassador."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Mister Spock, we'll leave orbit in two hours."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Would you care to beam down and visit your parents?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,This is the engineering section.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,There are a number of emergency back-up systems for the main controls.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Over here are a number of control computers.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Mister Spock.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"A moment, if you please."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Explain the computer components.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"I'm sorry, Ambassador."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I did not mean to offend.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I thought that
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Mrs. Sarek, I just don't understand."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Can you?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,It sounded more like a command.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,And Spock is his son.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Spock is my best officer, and my friend."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I take it that Spock disagreed with his father on a choice of career.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Starfleet force is used only as a last resort.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,We're an instrument of civilisation.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,And it's a better opportunity for a scientist to study the universe than he can get at the Vulcan Science Academy.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,They are both stubborn.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Excuse me.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Kirk here.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Source?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Go to alert status four.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Begin long-range scanning.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Kirk out.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Ambassador.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Gentlemen.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Ambassador Sarek is quite correct when he points out this is not the council chamber of Babel.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"I'm fully aware that the admission of Coridan is a highly debatable issue, but you won't solve it here."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Ambassador.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Kirk here.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,On my way.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,All duty personnel on Yellow Alert.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Don't alarm the passengers.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Kirk out.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Report.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Identification, Spock?"
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Does she answer a hail?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Care to guess what she is?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Mister Chekov, plot course to intercept that vessel."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I want to see what she looks like close up.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Ready main phasers.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Back on original course, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Report on intruder's movements.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Well, we have a shadow."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Faster, more manoeuvrable and unidentified."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Mister Spock, full analysis of sensor readings."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I want to know who that intruder is.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Gentlemen.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Gentlemen.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Whatever arguments you have between yourselves is your business.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,My business is running the ship.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"As long as I command, there will be order."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Kirk here.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,How was he killed?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Explain.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Who aboard would have that knowledge?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Spock.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"A short time ago, I broke up an argument between Gav and your father."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,You're saying he couldn't have done it?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"But if he had a reason, could he have done it?"
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Mrs. Sarek, I'm sorry to disturb you."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I must speak to your husband.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Ambassador, the Tellarite."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Gav has been murdered.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Yes.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Ambassador, where were you during the past hour?"
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Then where were you during the hour?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"That's a very convenient excuse, Ambassador."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Can you help him?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Spock?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I'm sorry about your father.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Aren't you worried about him?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I see.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Well, the Romulans have nothing like it."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Certainly not the Federation or the neutral planets.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,What about the Klingons?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Who, then?"
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Mister Chekov, directional locator indicates source bearing twenty seven, mark eight."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Switch recorder to Mister Spock's station for decode, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,A personal receiver?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Somebody on board is in contact with that vessel?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Why not?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Are any conclusions possible from the information?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Murder?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Someone out there playing tag?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Lieutenant, you've got your sensor locator on a wide beam."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,You've established a receiver on board this vessel.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Tighten your field to the interior of the ship.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"If that alien vessel starts transmitting again, I want to know who on board the Enterprise is receiving."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Bones, how is he?"
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Ambassador, when did you have these attacks?"
KIRK,Journey to Babel,There were no witnesses?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Why?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Bones, what about it?"
KIRK,Journey to Babel,There are other Vulcans aboard.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Bones.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Bridge.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Spock.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"I'm on deck five, near my quarters."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I've been attacked by an Andorian.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Security.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Security team.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I'd like to get my hands on the guy with the sledgehammer.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"No, the one inside my head."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,How long have I
KIRK,Journey to Babel,How's Sarek?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,What's stopping you?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I thought you were all ready.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"I can't damn him for his loyalty, for doing his duty, but I'm not going to let him commit patricide."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Bones, Sarek will die without that operation, and you can't operate without transfusions from Spock."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I'll convince Spock I'm all right and order him to report here.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"As soon as he leaves the bridge, I'll turn command over to Scotty and report to my quarters."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Will that fill your prescription?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"I'll take over, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,You report to Sickbay with Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Get out, Spock."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Chekov, what's the status of the intruder?"
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Any further transmissions, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Call Mister Scott to the bridge.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Belay that order.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I'll stay here.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Specific origin?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Security?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Security to the brig.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Search the prisoner immediately.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Kirk here.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Bring the prisoner to the bridge.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Deflectors on.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Red Alert.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Phasers stand by to fire on my order.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Chekov, take over Spock's scanners."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Target, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Fire as he passes, Ensign."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Report on his weaponry, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Standard phasers.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Good.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"They may have more speed, but they're not giants."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Tell them to take a good guess, but clear that board, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"On my order, fire photon torpedoes two, four and six."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Widest possible scatter.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Fire.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Auxiliary power.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Your friends out there are good.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,They'll have to destroy this ship to win.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,You're not Andorian.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Who are you?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Damage control procedures, all decks."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,That ship out there has phasers.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,At least our weapons are alike.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Engineering, this is the Captain."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Cut power on port side except for phaser banks.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"At my signal, cut starboard power."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Kirk out.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Who are you?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"You're a spy, surgically altered to pass as an Andorian."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Planted in the ambassador's party to use terror and murder to disrupt us and prepare for this attack.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Engineering, cut power on starboard side."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Maintain until further orders.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Chekov.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,You speculate.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,No.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Stand by your phasers, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Looking us over.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,We're dead as far as he knows.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Hold your fire, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Fire.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Secure from general quarters.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Lieutenant, open the hailing frequency."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,If they wish to surrender
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Lieutenant, relay to Starfleet command."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Tell them we have a prisoner.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Take him to Sickbay.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,So did they.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Mister Chekov, take over."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Bones?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Spock, Sarek how are they?"
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Bones!
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Some doctors have all the luck.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,We damaged their ship.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,They destroyed themselves to avoid capture.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Bones, Thelev's body will be brought to your lab."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,I want an autopsy performed as soon as possible.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,But what would they gain by an attack on Starfleet?
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Yes, of course."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"With Orion carefully neutral, they'd clean up supplying dilithium to both sides and continue to raid Coridan."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,You might have had something else on your mind.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"No, but thank you anyway."
KIRK,Journey to Babel,Bones.
KIRK,Journey to Babel,(starts to collapse.)
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"No, no, I'm all right"
KIRK,Journey to Babel,"Doctor McCoy, I believe you're enjoying all this."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Shuttlecraft approaching with Ambassador Sarek's party.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Estimate arrival one minute.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Standby to recover shuttlecraft.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Honour guard to the hangar deck.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Captain, sensors are registering an unidentified vessel pacing us."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"A small ship, Captain."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"It's been there five minutes, remaining outside phaser range at extreme limit of sensors."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Phasers armed and ready, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Back on original heading, Captain."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,The intruder changed course immediately after we did.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,It's paralleling us again.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"It's the intruder ship, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"No change, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Maintaining its distance.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Captain, the alien vessel is moving closer."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Captain, the alien ship has changed course and speed."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Moving directly toward us at warp eight.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Shields on.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Phasers manned and ready, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Moving away.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Turning now.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,He's coming around again.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"A clean miss, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Sensors record standard phasers, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,He's coming around again.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Fire control locked into the computers, Captain."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Full spread missed, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,They're moving too fast for us.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Number four shield has buckled, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Switching over.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Shields firming up.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Number four is still weak, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"If they hit us there again, it'll go altogether."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Number two shield is gone.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"We're starting to drift, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Shall I hold her on course?
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Phasers standing by.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,"He's just hovering out there, sir."
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Here he comes.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Range decreasing.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Speed dropping close to sublight.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Phasers locked on target.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Range closing.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Seventy five thousand kilometres.
CHEKOV,Journey to Babel,Got him!
VOICE,Journey to Babel,Clear hangar deck.
VOICE,Journey to Babel,Clear hangar deck.
VOICE,Journey to Babel,Depressurising.

SAREK,Journey to Babel,Captain.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"Your service honours us, Captain."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Doctor.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,My aides and she who is my wife.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"I'd prefer another guide, Captain."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"My wife, attend."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"I gave Spock his first instruction in computers, Captain."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,He chose to devote his knowledge to Starfleet instead of the Vulcan Science Academy.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Offence is a human emotion.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,I'm returning to my quarters.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"Continue, my wife."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,(leaves)
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"One hundred two point four three seven precisely, Doctor, measured in your years."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,I had other concerns.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"The vote will not be taken here, Ambassador Gav."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,My government's instructions will be heard in the council chambers on Babel.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Tellarites do not argue for reasons.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,They simply argue.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"You are correct, Captain."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Quite logical.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,We debated during my last council session.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Ambassador.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"Excuse me, Doctor."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,It has been a rather long day for my wife.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Captain.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,You embarrassed Spock this evening.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Not even a mother may do that.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,He is a Vulcan.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,He's a Starfleet officer.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,It is not a question of approval.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,The fact exists.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,He is in Starfleet.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,He must command respect if he is to function.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,It does not require pride to ask that Spock be given the respect which is his due.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"Not as my son, but as Spock."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Do you understand?
SAREK,Journey to Babel,It does seem unavoidable.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"You seem unwilling to wait for the council meeting, Ambassador."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,No matter.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,We favour admission.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"Under Federation law, Coridan can be protected and its wealth administered for the benefit of its people."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"Coridan has nearly unlimited wealth of dilithium crystals, but it is under-populated and unprotected."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,This invites illegal mining operations.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Some of your ships have been carrying Coridan dilithium crystals.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"Of course, Captain."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Threats are illogical.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,And payment is usually expensive.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"You want something of me, Captain?"
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Indeed?
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Interesting.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,I quite agree.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"In private meditation, Captain."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"Spock will tell you that such meditation is a personal experience, not to be discussed."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,especially not with Earthmen.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Yes.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,There were three others.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,My physician prescribed Benjisidrine for the condition.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,There was nothing you could have done.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"Two before we left Vulcan, the third a few hours ago."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,I was on the observation deck.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"When the Tellarite was murdered, I was quite incapacitated."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,None.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Because of the construction of the Vulcan heart.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"Yes, unquestionably."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,My blood type is T-negative.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"Somewhat rare, even for a Vulcan."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Mutual suspicion and interplanetary war.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,I don't understand.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,Spock acted in the only logical manner open to him.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"One does not thank logic, Amanda."
SAREK,Journey to Babel,She has always been that way.
SAREK,Journey to Babel,"At the time, it seemed the logical thing to do."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Vulcan honours us with your presence.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,We come to serve.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Captain, Ambassador Sarek and his wife are my parents."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Humans smile with so little provocation.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,The situation between my father and myself has not changed.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Yes, Captain?"
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"If you will excuse me, Captain."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,(leaves)
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Not precisely, Doctor."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"On Vulcan, the teddy bears are alive, and they have six-inch fangs."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Sensors indicate the size of a scout ship, but the configuration is unfamiliar."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Most unusual.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Starfleet records no authorised vessel in this quadrant except ours.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Guess, Captain?"
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I shall need more data for my estimate.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Vessel changing course, heading toward us at high warp speed."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Interesting.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,They were travelling at approximately warp ten.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Vulcans.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"On Vulcan, the method is called tal-shaya."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,It was considered a merciful form of execution in ancient times.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Indeed, Captain?"
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Interesting.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Vulcans do not approve of violence.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"No, Captain."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I'm merely saying it would be illogical to kill without reason.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"If there were a reason, my father is quite capable of killing."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Logically and efficiently.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Mother.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"If only on circumstantial evidence, he is a logical suspect."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I get sensor readings of tri-tritanium from the alien ship's hull.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Yes, it could adversely affect our mission."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Worry is a human emotion, Captain."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I accept what has happened.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,The ship's hull seems to have a high density level or is cloaked against sensor probes.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"It is manned, but sensors cannot make out specifics."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I think it unlikely it is one of theirs.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Possibly, Captain."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,But I cannot decode this transmission.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,It is in no known code.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,There's no detectable pattern.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,No standard references apply.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Only negative.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"It fits none of our computer records, and it is alien."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Doctor, do you propose surgery for the heart defect?"
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I suggest that a cryogenic open-heart procedure would be the logical approach.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"My blood is T-negative, Doctor."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,It should be possible to filter out the human factors.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Indeed.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I would estimate the odds
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Doctor.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Rigelian physiology is very similar to Vulcan.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,But it does look promising.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"I consider the safety factor low, but acceptable."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,It has been used successfully on test subjects on Rigel Five.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Miss Chapel?
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I underwent a physical examination last week.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Would you pull those records, please?"
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,It would seem the only answer.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Then you automatically condemn Sarek to death.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"And you, Doctor, have no logical alternative either."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"If you do not operate, Sarek will die."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,You now have the means to perform the operation.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I am volunteering myself as the blood donor.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I'll be at my station until you require me.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Spock here.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,(He passes out.)
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Captain?
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Captain?
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Captain?
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I'll be in the brig questioning the Andorian prisoner.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"No, Doctor."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,My first responsibility is to the ship.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Our passengers' safety is by Starfleet order of first importance.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"We are being followed by an alien, possibly hostile, vessel."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I cannot relinquish command under these circumstances.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"On what grounds, Doctor?"
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Command requirements do not recognise personal privilege.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I'll be in the brig interrogating the Andorian.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,He has been subjected to questioning under verifier scan and truth drug.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,He reveals nothing.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of a preconceived plan.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Apparently Thelev did.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I do not know.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the captain.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,There is no logic in Gav's murder.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Come in.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Mother, when I was commissioned, I took an oath to carry out responsibilities which were clearly and exactly specified."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Any competent officer can command this ship under normal circumstances.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,The circumstances are not normal.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,We're carrying over one hundred valuable Federation passengers.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,We're being pursued by an alien ship.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,We're subject to possible attack.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,There has been murder and attempted murder on board.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I cannot dismiss my duties.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"I know, but this must take precedence."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"If I could give the transfusion without loss of time or efficiency, I would."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Sarek understands my reason.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Mother, how can you have lived on Vulcan so long, married a Vulcan, raised a son on Vulcan, without understanding what it means to be a Vulcan?"
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"It means to adopt a philosophy, a way of life, which is logical and beneficial."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"We cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal gain, no matter how important that gain might be."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Can you imagine what my father would say if I were to agree, if I were to give up command of this vessel, jeopardise hundreds of lives, risk interplanetary war, all for the life of one person?"
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Mother
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I cannot.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Captain?
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Captain, are you quite all right?"
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I must see the captain.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,The alien ship.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"I've just realised that if their power utilisation curve is not the norm, it should be possible to identify them this way."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Very important.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Captain, I believe you'll find the alien"
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"I think you'll find he's an Orion, Doctor."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Intelligence reports that Orion smugglers have been raiding the Coridan system.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,The thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,It made them seem more powerful than a starship or anything known to us.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,That ship was constructed for a suicide mission.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Since they never intended to return to their home base, they could use one hundred percent power on their attacks."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,The thing I don't understand is why I didn't think of it earlier.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,That hardly seems likely.
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Emotional, isn't she?"
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Indeed?
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,Why did you marry her?
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Doctor, I'll return to my station now."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,"Indeed, Captain."
SPOCK,Journey to Babel,I've never seen him look so happy.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Captain Kirk.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"After all these years among humans, you still haven't learned to smile."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"And you haven't come to see us in four years, either."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Amanda.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,I'm afraid you couldn't pronounce the Vulcan name.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"After a fashion, and after many years of practice."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Shall we continue the tour?
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,My husband did request it.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Of course.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,He's a Vulcan.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,I'm his wife.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"You don't understand the Vulcan way, Captain."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,It's logical.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,It's a better way than ours.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,But it's not easy.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,It has kept Spock and Sarek from speaking as father and son for eighteen years.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,I'm glad he has such a friend.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,It hasn't been easy on Spock.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Neither human nor Vulcan.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,At home nowhere except Starfleet.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,My husband has nothing against Starfleet.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,But Vulcans believe that peace should not depend on force.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Perhaps.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"But Sarek wanted Spock to follow his teachings, as Sarek followed the teachings of his own father."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"A human trait, Captain?"
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Ambassador Gav lost.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"Well, he, he did have a pet sehlat he was very fond of."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,It's sort of a fat teddy bear.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,He's also human.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,I thought you didn't approve of Starfleet.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"Sarek, you're proud of him, aren't you?"
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,You're showing almost human pride in your son.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"Not really, but it doesn't matter."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,I love you anyway.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,I know.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,It isn't logical.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,He's been gone for some time.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,It's his habit to meditate in private before retiring.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,What's wrong?
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Spock?
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"Captain, you're not accusing him?"
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Sarek.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Sarek.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,What's wrong?
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,No.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Why didn't you tell me?
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Please don't.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"What drug, Doctor?"
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,My husband is asleep.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,What drug?
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,You're going to use it on yourself.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,A transfusion from you to your father.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,And I refuse to permit it.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,I won't risk both of you.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"Spock, you must turn command over to somebody else."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Any competent officer can command this ship.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Only you can give your father the blood transfusions that he needs to live.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Duty?
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Your duty is to your father.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"Well, I don't."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,It's not human.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,That's not a dirty word.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"You're human, too."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Let that part of you come through.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Your father's dying.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"If this is what it means, I don't want to know."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Nothing is as important as your father's life.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"When you were five years old and came home stiff-lipped, anguished, because the other boys tormented you saying that you weren't really Vulcan."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"I watched you, knowing that inside that the human part of you was crying and I cried, too."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"There must be some part of me in you, some part that I still can reach."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"If being Vulcan is more important to you, then you'll stand there speaking rules and regulations from Starfleet and Vulcan philosophy, and let your father die."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,And I'll hate you for the rest of my life.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"Oh, go to him."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Now.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Please.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"Captain, come in."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"And you, Sarek."
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Would you also say thank you to your son?
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,For saving your life.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,"Logic, logic!"
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,I'm sick to death of logic.
AMANDA,Journey to Babel,Do you want to know how I feel about your logic?
UHURA,Journey to Babel,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"Captain, I've picked up some sort of signal."
UHURA,Journey to Babel,Just a few symbols.
UHURA,Journey to Babel,Nothing intelligible.
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"That's what bothers me, sir."
UHURA,Journey to Babel,Impossible to locate.
UHURA,Journey to Babel,There wasn't enough of it.
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"Sensors show nothing in the area, but it was a strong signal, as though it was very close."
UHURA,Journey to Babel,I've tried all frequencies and hooked in the universal translator.
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"No response, sir."
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"Captain, Starfleet acknowledges report on our situation and confirms no authorised Federation vessel in this quadrant."
UHURA,Journey to Babel,Captain?
UHURA,Journey to Babel,I picked up the last part of a transmission.
UHURA,Journey to Babel,Just like that other one.
UHURA,Journey to Babel,I put the recorder and the directional locator on it immediately.
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"Sir, the directional locator indicates reception point somewhere within the body of this ship."
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"None, sir."
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"Captain, I'm picking up the alien signal again, but it's coming from inside the Enterprise."
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"From the brig, sir."
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"Captain, the intercoms are jammed."
UHURA,Journey to Babel,All the ambassadors are asking what's going on.
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"Damage reports coming in, Captain."
UHURA,Journey to Babel,Every deck.
UHURA,Journey to Babel,"Aye, sir."
GAV,Journey to Babel,"(a stout chap with a porcine nose) Sarek of Vulcan, do you vote to admit Coridan to the Federation?"
GAV,Journey to Babel,No!
GAV,Journey to Babel,You!
GAV,Journey to Babel,"How do you vote, Sarek of Vulcan?"
GAV,Journey to Babel,"In council, his vote carries others."
GAV,Journey to Babel,I will know where he stands and why.
GAV,Journey to Babel,No.
GAV,Journey to Babel,You
GAV,Journey to Babel,You will excuse me.
GAV,Journey to Babel,(stalks away)
GAV,Journey to Babel,"Vulcan, I would speak to you."
GAV,Journey to Babel,How do you vote on the Coridan admission?
GAV,Journey to Babel,You favour?
GAV,Journey to Babel,Why?
GAV,Journey to Babel,That's well for you.
GAV,Journey to Babel,Vulcan has no mining interest.
GAV,Journey to Babel,Illegal?
GAV,Journey to Babel,You accuse us?
GAV,Journey to Babel,You call us thieves?
GAV,Journey to Babel,Understood.
GAV,Journey to Babel,"There will be payment for your slander, Sarek."
SHRAS,Journey to Babel,"(thin and blue, with two antennae) Why must you know, Tellarite?"
SHRAS,Journey to Babel,"My apologies, Captain."
SHRAS,Journey to Babel,"Have you met Gav before, Ambassador?"
SHRAS,Journey to Babel,"He is Thelev, a minor member of my staff."
SHRAS,Journey to Babel,I know nothing of him except that he has served adequately.
SHRAS,Journey to Babel,"My people are a violent race, but we've no quarrel with Captain Kirk."
SHRAS,Journey to Babel,You suggest a plot.
SHRAS,Journey to Babel,How could it profit us to harm the captain?
SHRAS,Journey to Babel,Perhaps you should forget logic and devote yourself to motivations of passion or gain.
SHRAS,Journey to Babel,Those are reasons for murder.
JOSEPH,Journey to Babel,Security to Captain Kirk.
JOSEPH,Journey to Babel,"Lieutenant Joseph, sir."
JOSEPH,Journey to Babel,"I'm on deck eleven, section A3."
JOSEPH,Journey to Babel,I've just found one of the Tellarites murdered.
JOSEPH,Journey to Babel,"I think it's the ambassador himself, sir."
JOSEPH,Journey to Babel,Security here.
JOSEPH,Journey to Babel,We had to stun the Andorian.
JOSEPH,Journey to Babel,He had some sort of transceiver.
JOSEPH,Journey to Babel,It was hidden in his antenna.
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,Doctor?
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,I've checked the blood bank.
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,There isn't enough Vulcan blood and plasma to even begin such an operation of this type.
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,We've run a number of blood tests on Mister Spock.
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,It isn't true Vulcan blood either.
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,It has human blood elements in it.
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,Already pulled.
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,"You're perfectly healthy, Mister Spock."
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,"(monitoring Sarek) Doctor, the K2 factor is dropping."
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,Doctor McCoy?
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,The one who hit you?
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,Mister Spock's blood reproduction rate is up over two hundred percent.
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,Sarek's heartbeat has risen to three hundred and twenty four.
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,"Blood pressure ninety over forty, dropping."
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,Mister Spock.
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,"Doctor, his heart's stopped."
CHAPEL,Journey to Babel,The systems are off.
THELEV,Journey to Babel,"That was intended from the beginning, Captain."
THELEV,Journey to Babel,"Find your own answers, Captain."
THELEV,Journey to Babel,You haven't long to live.
THELEV,Journey to Babel,"Speculation, Captain."
THELEV,Journey to Babel,What are you doing?
THELEV,Journey to Babel,You're baiting him.
THELEV,Journey to Babel,You're trying to lure him in.
THELEV,Journey to Babel,"They could not surrender, Captain."
THELEV,Journey to Babel,They had orders to self-destruct.
THELEV,Journey to Babel,"Only temporarily, Captain."
THELEV,Journey to Babel,"You see, I had orders to self-destruct, too."
THELEV,Journey to Babel,Slow poison.
THELEV,Journey to Babel,"Quite painless, actually, but there's no known antidote."
THELEV,Journey to Babel,I anticipate another ten minutes of life.
THELEV,Journey to Babel,I seem to have miscalculated.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Yes, Jim."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Oh, about another thirty minutes."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,I've come across some most interesting organic compounds.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Hey, Starfleet was right."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,These roots and soil cultures can be a medical treasure house.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Any problems there?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Enterprise, alert!"
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Stand by to beam up landing party.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Now, Scotty."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Have medics stand by.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Pressure packet.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Lucky his heart's where his liver should be, or he'd be dead now."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Coranalin.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"I don't know yet, Jim."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,McCoy here.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,I'll call you soon as I know anything.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Sickbay out.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Agreed.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Sterilite off.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"He'll live or die now, Jim."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,I don't know which.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Doctor M'Benga interned on a Vulcan ward.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,He couldn't be in better hands.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,I can't leave Spock at this time.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,And if that's not it?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"I appreciate the compliment, Jim, but"
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Want to think about it again, Jim?"
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Starfleet's orders about this planet state no interference with
MCCOY,A Private Little War,I read it.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Inhabitants superior in many ways to humans.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Left alone, they undoubtedly someday will develop a remarkably advanced and peaceful culture."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Do I have a choice?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Enterprise, McCoy."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Emergency.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Come in.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Enterprise, come in."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,McCoy!
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Emergency!
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"(giving an injection) Jim, there is no antitoxin for this poison."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,I can only keep you alive a few hours with this.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Are you hill people?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Do you know a hunter named Tyree?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,A mugato attacked him.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,He's James Kirk.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,He's a friend of Tyree's.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Blast it!
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Do something!
MCCOY,A Private Little War,He's dying!
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Medical log, stardate 4211.8."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Kirk is right about the people here.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Despite their fear and our strangeness, they're compassionate and gentle."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,I've learned the hunter Tyree is now their leader.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"He is expected to return shortly with his wife, who they say knows how to cure this poison."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,My problem.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,The captain is in deep shock.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,I must keep him warm and alive until then.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,You and your Garden of Eden.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,What's that?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,A plant?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,It moves.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"How do you feel, Jim?"
MCCOY,A Private Little War,I want to thank you for saving his life.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,(Nona's hand is healed too) I would like to learn more about this.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,He is hers?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Jim.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Have you seen any strangers among the villagers?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Many ways?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,What else does she know about us?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,A splendid custom if not carried to extremes.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"What's bothering you, Jim?"
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"If we find the Klingons have helped the villagers, there's certainly something we can do."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Jim, this man believes in the same thing we believe in."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,That killing is stupid and useless.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Jim.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Coal for forge, sulphur for gun powder."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,(scanning) This pig iron is almost carbon-free.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,That village furnace certainly didn't produce it.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,People's exhibit number two.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Cold-rolled gun barrel rod fashioned to look homemade.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"You were right about the Klingons, Jim."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,KIRK: Make recorder and scanner tapes of everything.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Right.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,It's a pity we can't include a live Klingon.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,That'd just about wrap it
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Jim, I want to talk to you."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Do I have to say it?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,It's not bad enough there's one serpent in Eden teaching one side about gun powder.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,You want to make sure they all know about it!
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Have you gone out of your mind?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Yes, maybe you have."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Tyree's wife, she said there was something in that root."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,She said now you can refuse her nothing.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Is it a coincidence this is exactly what she wants?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Jim, that means you're condemning this whole planet to a war that may never end."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"It could go on for year after year, massacre after massacre."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,I don't have a solution.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,But furnishing them firearms is certainly not the answer.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Yes, I remember."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,It went on bloody year after bloody year.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,And if the Klingons give their side even more?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,And what about your friend Tyree?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Will he understand this balance of power?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Well, Jim, here's another morsel of agony for you."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Since Tyree won't fight, he will be one of the first to die."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Where's Captain Kirk?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Tyree, the firestick."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Where is it?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,That's a fine thing to leave lying around.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Show us where it is.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Jim?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Jim.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Who hit you?
MCCOY,A Private Little War,She's dead.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,Here.
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Well, you got what you wanted."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Spock, are you alive?"
MCCOY,A Private Little War,"Well, I don't know why I was worried."
MCCOY,A Private Little War,You can't kill a computer.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"How much longer, McCoy?"
KIRK,A Private Little War,No sign of the inhabitants so far.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Kirk out.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Yes, the mugato."
KIRK,A Private Little War,"No problem, though."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Those prints are several days old.
KIRK,A Private Little War,They seldom stay in one place.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Or so it seemed to the brash young Lieutenant Kirk on his first planet survey.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Except these people stayed in their Garden of Eden.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Bows and arrows for hunting, but absolutely no fighting among themselves."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Remarkably peaceful and tranquil.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Villagers with flintlocks?
KIRK,A Private Little War,That's impossible.
KIRK,A Private Little War,They hadn't progressed nearly that far.
KIRK,A Private Little War,One of those men walking into ambush is Tyree.
KIRK,A Private Little War,The friend I lived with here.
KIRK,A Private Little War,(He draws his phaser.)
KIRK,A Private Little War,Spock?
KIRK,A Private Little War,Your phaser.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"(it is missing, so Kirk prepares to use his to defend his friend.)"
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Beam us up, quickly."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Lead projectile.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Primitive firearm.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Bones, can you save him?"
KIRK,A Private Little War,Kirk here.
KIRK,A Private Little War,On my way.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Scotty.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Bones?
KIRK,A Private Little War,Good.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Go to Yellow Alert.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Do you think you can keep us out of their sight, Chekov?"
KIRK,A Private Little War,"No point in giving ourselves away, Lieutenant."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Not until we find out what's going on.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Kirk to Sickbay.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"So, they've broken the treaty."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Research is not the Klingon way.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"When I left there thirteen years ago, those villagers had barely learned to forge iron."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Spock was shot with a flintlock.
KIRK,A Private Little War,How many centuries between those two developments?
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Yes, I'm aware of that, Mister Scott."
KIRK,A Private Little War,I did not invite a debate.
KIRK,A Private Little War,I'm sorry.
KIRK,A Private Little War,I'm worried about Spock and concerned about what's happened to something I once knew down there.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"You have the conn, Scotty."
KIRK,A Private Little War,I'll be in Sickbay.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Then you and I are transporting down.
KIRK,A Private Little War,You just indicated you could.
KIRK,A Private Little War,There are Klingons here.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"If their mission is a legitimate research interest in the planet's organic potential, then you're the one man who can tell me."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Then I need help.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Advice I can trust as much as Spock's.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Bones, I'm as worried about Spock as you are, but if the Klingons are breaking the treaty it could be interstellar war."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Kirk to Bridge.
KIRK,A Private Little War,McCoy and I are transporting back down.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Inform ship's stores that we'll need native costumes.
KIRK,A Private Little War,I understand.
KIRK,A Private Little War,We'll arrange a rendezvous schedule.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Kirk out.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Perfect.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Tyree's camp's a quarter of a mile away.
KIRK,A Private Little War,No interference with normal social development.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"I'm not only aware of it, it was my survey thirteen years ago that recommended it."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Indeed.
KIRK,A Private Little War,And I intend to see that they have that chance.
KIRK,A Private Little War,You coming with me?
KIRK,A Private Little War,(shaking) Contact ship.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Took full poison.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Fangs.
KIRK,A Private Little War,They left.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Out of orbit.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Tyree.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Some of his men.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Cure.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Bones.
KIRK,A Private Little War,I had the strangest dream.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Tired.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Very tired.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"You did a fine job, Bones."
KIRK,A Private Little War,I think I'll sleep.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Bones.
KIRK,A Private Little War,What are you doing here?
KIRK,A Private Little War,(their voices wake Tyree) Tyree.
KIRK,A Private Little War,My old friend.
KIRK,A Private Little War,What am I doing here?
KIRK,A Private Little War,A mugato bite!
KIRK,A Private Little War,I remember.
KIRK,A Private Little War,I told him to take me to Tyree's camp.
KIRK,A Private Little War,I knew you'd find a kahn-ut-tu to cure me.
KIRK,A Private Little War,The kahn-ut-tu is the local witch people here.
KIRK,A Private Little War,They've studied (Nona gets up and stands in front of him) They've studied the roots and the herbs.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Yes, of course."
KIRK,A Private Little War,I should've guessed.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Congratulations.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Tyree, we must talk now."
KIRK,A Private Little War,"The villagers, their new weapons."
KIRK,A Private Little War,I want to hear all about that.
KIRK,A Private Little War,We must make plans.
KIRK,A Private Little War,You say they make the firesticks themselves?
KIRK,A Private Little War,How can you be sure?
KIRK,A Private Little War,Can you take us to their village while it's still dark?
KIRK,A Private Little War,(showing his phaser) You've seen how these work.
KIRK,A Private Little War,We're simply strangers from
KIRK,A Private Little War,I am grateful.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"We once were as you are, Spears, arrows."
KIRK,A Private Little War,"There came a time when our weapons grew faster than our wisdom, and we almost destroyed ourselves."
KIRK,A Private Little War,"We learned from this to make a rule during all our travels, Never to cause the same to happen to other worlds."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Just as a man must grow in his own way and in his own time.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Perhaps not as fast or in the way another thinks he should.
KIRK,A Private Little War,But we're wise enough to know that we are wise enough not to interfere with the way of a man or another world.
KIRK,A Private Little War,That's what's bothering me.
KIRK,A Private Little War,The something we may have to do.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Tyree, supposing you had to fight?"
KIRK,A Private Little War,What then?
KIRK,A Private Little War,Tyree?
KIRK,A Private Little War,The gun.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Ammunition.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Doctor.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Let's take a look inside.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Well, here's your forge."
KIRK,A Private Little War,People's exhibit number one.
KIRK,A Private Little War,A chrome steel drill point.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Bones!
KIRK,A Private Little War,(to Tyree) Move!
KIRK,A Private Little War,Fast!
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Men, this is the pan."
KIRK,A Private Little War,This is the hammer.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"The hammer striking the pan causes a spark, ignites the powder, and fires the flintlock."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Now aim it as I showed you.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Hold your breath and squeeze the trigger gently.
KIRK,A Private Little War,(Tyree shoots the clay pot target) Well done.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Very, very, very good."
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Not here, Bones."
KIRK,A Private Little War,In the cave.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Yutan, your turn."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Exactly.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Each side receives the same knowledge and the same type of firearm.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Superstition.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Is it?
KIRK,A Private Little War,She wants superior weapons.
KIRK,A Private Little War,That's the one thing neither side can have.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Bones.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Bones, the normal development of this planet was the status quo between the hill people and the villagers."
KIRK,A Private Little War,The Klingons changed that with the flintlocks.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"If this planet is to develop the way it should, we must equalize both sides again."
KIRK,A Private Little War,"All right, Doctor!"
KIRK,A Private Little War,All right.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Say I'm wrong.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Say I'm drugged.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Say the woman drugged me.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"What is your sober, sensible solution to all this?"
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Bones, do you remember the twentieth century brush wars on the Asian continent?"
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Two giant powers involved, much like the Klingons and ourselves."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Neither side felt could pull out.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"What would you have suggested, that one side arm its friends with an overpowering weapon?"
KIRK,A Private Little War,Mankind would never have lived to travel space if they had.
KIRK,A Private Little War,No.
KIRK,A Private Little War,The only solution is what happened back then.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Balance of power.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Then we arm our side with exactly that much more.
KIRK,A Private Little War,A balance of power.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"The trickiest, most difficult, dirtiest game of them all, but the only one that preserves both sides."
KIRK,A Private Little War,No.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Probably not.
KIRK,A Private Little War,But I'm going to have to try and make him understand.
KIRK,A Private Little War,I never had a more difficult task.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Well, war isn't a good life, but it's life."
KIRK,A Private Little War,His wife is the only way to reach him.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"If I tell her we're going to supply guns, maybe she'll convince him."
KIRK,A Private Little War,(Kirk finds Nona near a stream which is running over a rock.
KIRK,A Private Little War,She has been bathing.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Nona.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Pardon me.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Oh?
KIRK,A Private Little War,I thought it was my idea.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Nona
KIRK,A Private Little War,I'd like to talk to you.
KIRK,A Private Little War,I would like
KIRK,A Private Little War,I feel dizzy.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Yes, you are lovely."
KIRK,A Private Little War,You're beautiful.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Nona.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"No, no."
KIRK,A Private Little War,I'm all right.
KIRK,A Private Little War,My phaser.
KIRK,A Private Little War,She took it.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Tomorrow in the palm of her hands.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Not what I wanted, Bones."
KIRK,A Private Little War,What had to be.
KIRK,A Private Little War,(McCoy hands him a communicator from his bag) Kirk here.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"Spock, ask Scotty how long it would take him to reproduce a hundred flintlocks."
KIRK,A Private Little War,A hundred serpents.
KIRK,A Private Little War,Serpents for the Garden of Eden.
KIRK,A Private Little War,"We're very tired, Mister Spock."
KIRK,A Private Little War,Beam us up home.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,Large prints.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,The ape-like carnivore in the reports?
SPOCK,A Private Little War,"Aside from that, you say it's a Garden of Eden?"
SPOCK,A Private Little War,Class M in all respects.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,Quite Earth-like.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,"Bows and arrows, Captain?"
SPOCK,A Private Little War,"Captain, look."
SPOCK,A Private Little War,"Captain, use of our phasers is expressly forbidden."
SPOCK,A Private Little War,"No, Captain."
SPOCK,A Private Little War,I can travel.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,Nurse.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,Hit me.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,The pain will help me to consciousness.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,Hit me.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,"Blast you, strike me!"
SPOCK,A Private Little War,"If I don't regain consciousness soon, it may be too late."
SPOCK,A Private Little War,Hit me.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,(she slaps his face) Harder!
SPOCK,A Private Little War,Again.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,Continue.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,The pain will help me to consciousness.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,That will be quite enough.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,"Thank you, doctor."
SPOCK,A Private Little War,"She was doing as I requested, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,A Private Little War,A Vulcan form of self-healing.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,"Thank you, nurse."
SPOCK,A Private Little War,I'm quite fully recovered.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,"Position, Mister Scott?"
SPOCK,A Private Little War,The Klingons?
SPOCK,A Private Little War,Stand by to signal the captain.
SPOCK,A Private Little War,"An illogical question, Doctor, since obviously you are hearing my voice."
VOICE,A Private Little War,Ho!
VOICE,A Private Little War,Take cover here!
TYREE,A Private Little War,Villagers!
TYREE,A Private Little War,"Nona, enough."
TYREE,A Private Little War,In time the villagers will return to their ways of friendship.
TYREE,A Private Little War,I took you because you cast a spell upon me.
TYREE,A Private Little War,The night of madness.
TYREE,A Private Little War,"No, Nona."
TYREE,A Private Little War,No!
TYREE,A Private Little War,It brought up evil beasts from my soul.
TYREE,A Private Little War,"Nona, where's Kirk?"
TYREE,A Private Little War,The cave?
TYREE,A Private Little War,You must.
TYREE,A Private Little War,He is the one I told you of.
TYREE,A Private Little War,The friend of my younger days.
TYREE,A Private Little War,I gave him my promise of silence.
TYREE,A Private Little War,He was made my brother.
TYREE,A Private Little War,Nona
TYREE,A Private Little War,I am Tyree.
TYREE,A Private Little War,It is Kirk.
TYREE,A Private Little War,She will cure him.
TYREE,A Private Little War,She must sleep also.
TYREE,A Private Little War,"When a man and woman are joined in this manner, he can refuse her no wish."
TYREE,A Private Little War,But it is only legend.
TYREE,A Private Little War,"Yes, James!"
TYREE,A Private Little War,"James, it's good to see you."
TYREE,A Private Little War,"My wife, Nona."
TYREE,A Private Little War,"Much has happened since you left, James."
TYREE,A Private Little War,"Come, we'll speak of it."
TYREE,A Private Little War,Come.
TYREE,A Private Little War,"(the men leave, but he stops Nona from following.)"
TYREE,A Private Little War,We will speak of it.
TYREE,A Private Little War,The firesticks first appeared nearly a year ago.
TYREE,A Private Little War,"Since that time, many of my people have died."
TYREE,A Private Little War,I've looked into their village.
TYREE,A Private Little War,I have seen it being done.
TYREE,A Private Little War,Strangers?
TYREE,A Private Little War,No.
TYREE,A Private Little War,"Yes, but the mugatos travel at night also."
TYREE,A Private Little War,You killed one.
TYREE,A Private Little War,Its mate will not be far.
TYREE,A Private Little War,You will not speak of this to others.
TYREE,A Private Little War,No!
TYREE,A Private Little War,I said I will not kill!
TYREE,A Private Little War,You will help in ways she does not understand.
TYREE,A Private Little War,"I have faith in our friendship, James."
TYREE,A Private Little War,"Come, before we lose the darkness."
TYREE,A Private Little War,(leaves)
TYREE,A Private Little War,The guard.
TYREE,A Private Little War,We must wait.
TYREE,A Private Little War,Now.
TYREE,A Private Little War,Come.
TYREE,A Private Little War,There!
TYREE,A Private Little War,I left it there.
TYREE,A Private Little War,I do not want it.
TYREE,A Private Little War,Nona!
TYREE,A Private Little War,"I want more of these, Kirk."
TYREE,A Private Little War,Many more!
TYREE,A Private Little War,"Yutan, two of those who killed my wife have escaped."
TYREE,A Private Little War,Track them down.
TYREE,A Private Little War,I will kill them.
SCOTT,A Private Little War,"What happened, Captain?"
SCOTT,A Private Little War,"We can hide for a while, sir, but we may have to go out of orbit to keep it up for long."
SCOTT,A Private Little War,"Not necessarily, Captain."
SCOTT,A Private Little War,They have as much right to scientific missions here as we have.
SCOTT,A Private Little War,"True, but since this is a hands-off planet, how are you going to prove they're doing otherwise?"
SCOTT,A Private Little War,"On the other hand, a flintlock would be the first firearm the inhabitants would normally develop."
SCOTT,A Private Little War,"And were the Klingons behind it, why didn't they give them breechloaders?"
SCOTT,A Private Little War,"Bridge, Scott here."
SCOTT,A Private Little War,"Captain, we may have to break out of orbit any minute to keep out of their sight."
SCOTT,A Private Little War,We'd be out of communicator range with you.
SCOTT,A Private Little War,"(running in and dragging her away) What are you doing, woman?"
SCOTT,A Private Little War,Have you gone daft?
SCOTT,A Private Little War,What's this all about?
SCOTT,A Private Little War,"Entering distant orbit, sir."
SCOTT,A Private Little War,Approaching rendezvous time.
SCOTT,A Private Little War,"(losing his grin) I didn't get that exactly, Captain."
SCOTT,A Private Little War,A hundred what?
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,"(an African doctor, to Nurse Chapel) Vitalizer B."
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,"Not good, sir."
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,"We've no replacements for the damaged organs, sir."
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,"If he's going to live, his Vulcan physiology will have to do it for him."
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,Don't let these low panel readings bother you.
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,I've seen this before in Vulcans.
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,"It's their way of concentrating all their strength, blood, and antibodies onto the injured organs."
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,A form of self-induced hypnosis.
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,"Well, in a sense."
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,"He knows we're here and what we're saying, but he can't afford to take his mind from the tissue he's fighting to heal."
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,I suppose he even knows you were holding his hand.
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,(leaves)
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,Just as they should.
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,This is Doctor M'Benga.
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,There will be someone with you constantly now.
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,"When the time comes, I'll be called."
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,"(to Chapel) As soon as he shows any signs of consciousness, call me immediately."
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,"After you've called me, if he speaks, do whatever he says."
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,Yes.
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,"That's clear enough, isn't it?"
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,"Please, release her."
M'BENGA,A Private Little War,"As you saw, they must wait until the last possible moment then fight their way back to consciousness."
UHURA,A Private Little War,"All decks, Red Alert!"
UHURA,A Private Little War,"Battle stations, battle stations!"
UHURA,A Private Little War,Go to Red Alert!
UHURA,A Private Little War,"Uhura, sir."
UHURA,A Private Little War,We have a Klingon vessel on our screen.
UHURA,A Private Little War,"Make that definite, sir."
UHURA,A Private Little War,They're sending a routine message to their home base with no mention of us.
UHURA,A Private Little War,Yellow Alert.
UHURA,A Private Little War,All stations go to Yellow Alert.
UHURA,A Private Little War,"Message to Starbase, sir?"
UHURA,A Private Little War,"On Earth, about twelve, sir."
UHURA,A Private Little War,We've seen different development at rates on different planets.
UHURA,A Private Little War,Or old-style hand lasers?
UHURA,A Private Little War,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,A Private Little War,"Captain, we're holding the planet between us and the Klingons."
CHEKOV,A Private Little War,I don't think they've spotted us.
CHEKOV,A Private Little War,"I can try, Captain."
CHEKOV,A Private Little War,"And, sir, the fact Earth took twelve centuries doesn't mean they had to."
CHEKOV,A Private Little War,Or machine guns?
CHEKOV,A Private Little War,"They haven't spotted us yet, sir."
CHEKOV,A Private Little War,Looks like they're beaming someone aboard.
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,"Yes, sir."
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,You mean he's conscious?
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,A good nurse always treats her patients that way.
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,It proves she's interested.
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,The readings are beginning to fluctuate.
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,"Yes, Doctor."
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,Do whatever he says?
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,Yes?
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,Hit you?
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,No!
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,I can't
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,Leave me alone!
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,Mister Spock needs me!
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,Let go!
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,"Here, let me help you, Mister Spock."
CHAPEL,A Private Little War,"Yes, I see you are."
YUTAN,A Private Little War,Take him to the cave.
YUTAN,A Private Little War,I bring Tyree.
YUTAN,A Private Little War,Forgive me.
YUTAN,A Private Little War,There are strangers in our camp.
YUTAN,A Private Little War,One has taken the mugato bite.
YUTAN,A Private Little War,He dies.
YUTAN,A Private Little War,"It is said the dying one is a friend of Tyree, from long ago."
NONA,A Private Little War,"We must obtain the same firesticks, husband."
NONA,A Private Little War,You could be killing them instead.
NONA,A Private Little War,"We could take their houses, their goods."
NONA,A Private Little War,In time?
NONA,A Private Little War,They kill your people!
NONA,A Private Little War,I am a Kahn-ut-tu woman.
NONA,A Private Little War,"In all this land, how many are there?"
NONA,A Private Little War,Men seek us because through us they become great leaders.
NONA,A Private Little War,And I have spells that help me keep you.
NONA,A Private Little War,Remember this leaf?
NONA,A Private Little War,The night we camped by the water?
NONA,A Private Little War,"Oh, Tyree, did you really hate that madness?"
NONA,A Private Little War,"Only one lovely beast, Tyree, my huge, angry man."
NONA,A Private Little War,What is it?
NONA,A Private Little War,Strangers?
NONA,A Private Little War,That one.
NONA,A Private Little War,Bring him when his head clears.
NONA,A Private Little War,"The stranger, where is he?"
NONA,A Private Little War,"Tyree, you wish me to save him?"
NONA,A Private Little War,My remedies require I know what kind of man he is.
NONA,A Private Little War,All that is known of him.
NONA,A Private Little War,"And I am your wife, his sister."
NONA,A Private Little War,I promise silence also.
NONA,A Private Little War,Quickly!
NONA,A Private Little War,Or he dies.
NONA,A Private Little War,And I'm Tyree's woman.
NONA,A Private Little War,A mahko root.
NONA,A Private Little War,"For those who know where to find it, how to use it, how to pick it."
NONA,A Private Little War,Take this of my soul.
NONA,A Private Little War,This of my soul.
NONA,A Private Little War,Thine own.
NONA,A Private Little War,Into thine.
NONA,A Private Little War,Deeply.
NONA,A Private Little War,Together.
NONA,A Private Little War,Your pain is mine.
NONA,A Private Little War,All mine.
NONA,A Private Little War,"Your soul and mine, together!"
NONA,A Private Little War,Return.
NONA,A Private Little War,It is past.
NONA,A Private Little War,Return.
NONA,A Private Little War,Return!
NONA,A Private Little War,Our blood has passed through the mahko root together.
NONA,A Private Little War,Our souls have been together.
NONA,A Private Little War,He is mine now.
NONA,A Private Little War,"I am a kahn-ut-tu, Captain."
NONA,A Private Little War,I cured you.
NONA,A Private Little War,Good.
NONA,A Private Little War,It is past time to plan.
NONA,A Private Little War,And of things to be done.
NONA,A Private Little War,"I've seen them also, and I know you have many ways to make your friend Tyree a man of great importance."
NONA,A Private Little War,Tyree has told me much of you.
NONA,A Private Little War,Do not blame him.
NONA,A Private Little War,It was the price for saving your life.
NONA,A Private Little War,"From one of the lights in the sky, and you have ways as far above firesticks as the sky above our world."
NONA,A Private Little War,I will not if I am made to understand.
NONA,A Private Little War,Teach me.
NONA,A Private Little War,There's an old custom among my people.
NONA,A Private Little War,"When a woman saves a man's life, he is grateful."
NONA,A Private Little War,Some men never grow.
NONA,A Private Little War,You must let the villagers destroy us?
NONA,A Private Little War,You will not help your friend and brother kill them instead?
NONA,A Private Little War,We must fight or die!
NONA,A Private Little War,Is dying better?
NONA,A Private Little War,You would let him die when you have weapons to make him powerful and safe?
NONA,A Private Little War,Then he has the wrong friends.
NONA,A Private Little War,And I have the wrong husband.
NONA,A Private Little War,(leaves)
NONA,A Private Little War,You are here because I wished you here.
NONA,A Private Little War,Yes.
NONA,A Private Little War,They always believe they come of free will.
NONA,A Private Little War,Tyree thought the same when I cast my first spell on him.
NONA,A Private Little War,Can you smell this fragrance?
NONA,A Private Little War,Some find it pleasing.
NONA,A Private Little War,Again.
NONA,A Private Little War,Some find it soothing.
NONA,A Private Little War,Yes.
NONA,A Private Little War,Happy.
NONA,A Private Little War,Yes.
NONA,A Private Little War,You feel good.
NONA,A Private Little War,Kiss me.
NONA,A Private Little War,I bring you victory for Apella!
NONA,A Private Little War,Take me to him.
NONA,A Private Little War,He will have the strength to use this new weapon.
NONA,A Private Little War,"Touch me again, and this small box will kill you."
NONA,A Private Little War,This weapon I bring you is far greater than your firesticks.
KRELL,A Private Little War,"You are late, my friend Apella."
KRELL,A Private Little War,Give her to the man who killed the most of her people.
KRELL,A Private Little War,The others will see the profit in bravery.
KRELL,A Private Little War,I'll make a Klingon of you yet.
KRELL,A Private Little War,A way to shoot further and straighter.
KRELL,A Private Little War,It's quite simple.
KRELL,A Private Little War,I'll show you.
KRELL,A Private Little War,"You will be rich one day, Apella, beyond your dreams."
KRELL,A Private Little War,The leader of a whole world.
KRELL,A Private Little War,A governor in the Klingon Empire.
KRELL,A Private Little War,Guards!
KRELL,A Private Little War,Intruders!
APELLA,A Private Little War,A quarrel by my people.
APELLA,A Private Little War,A division of some skins and a hill woman taken this morning.
APELLA,A Private Little War,It's hard to divide one woman.
APELLA,A Private Little War,What?
APELLA,A Private Little War,Is it difficult to cut grooves into the barrels?
APELLA,A Private Little War,I thought my people would grow tired of killing.
APELLA,A Private Little War,But you were right.
APELLA,A Private Little War,They see that it is easier than trading and it has pleasures.
APELLA,A Private Little War,I feel it myself.
APELLA,A Private Little War,"Like the hunt, but with richer rewards."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Ensign Chekov, Lieutenant Uhura, and I will
beam down and make a routine check of its facilities."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Good.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Mind the store, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Lieutenant Uhura, let's go."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Energise, Scotty."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It must be a transporter malfunction.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",This isn't Gamma Two.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Look at the colour of that sky.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(it's
green)"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",That's a trinary sun.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",That's what I'd like to know.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Kirk to
Enterprise."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Dead.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",(People are approaching them.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","One big guy in a fur, with teeth that
hold his mouth open, another male with a knife, a female in pink
carrying a lance-like weapon, and another in silver with green hair.)"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Phasers on stun.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Fire.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",(nothing happens) Hand-to-hand.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Either of you hurt?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",How do you know our names?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","These Providers of yours, are they"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What do they want from us?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Thralls?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You must be mistaken.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We're officers of a United
spaceship on Federation business."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We're not going anywhere until we have some information.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Who are
you?"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What is this place?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What do you think you're going to do with us?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",This system's star is a trinary.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Limits it a bit, but we're a
long way from the Enterprise, if we're in the same dimension."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What do you want from her?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Lieutenant, are you all right?"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Uhura!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Lieutenant!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Lieutenant, are
you all right?"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Lieutenant, answer me!"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Lieutenant!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","What's happening to
Lieutenant Uhura?"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Lieutenant, are you all right?"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I didn't realise I was so hungry.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Whatever
you call this, it is very good."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Nourishment.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",That's very practical.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What do you call this collar?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Vended?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You mean bought, sold."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Our race has another name for it.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Slavery.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","This collar of
obedience, is Galt the only one who can operate it?"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",How does he work it?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Will you provide all my nourishment?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Yes, I'm sure you will."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I must say, I've never seen a top
sergeant who looked like you."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It means you're a very beautiful woman.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You mean nobody's ever told you that before?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","well, er, beautiful
is, Beautiful."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(he holds up the tray so she can see her reflection)
That's beautiful."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Shahna, where were you born?"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Your parents.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Where are they?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Your mother and father.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Freestyle?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Lars and Chekov's drill thrall.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",They weren't born here.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Where do
they come from?"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","None of us will do it, Galt."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",The devil with the Providers.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",No.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",No!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I am responsible for the actions of my people.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I demand
to see the Providers."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",He's pretty fast with that whip.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We're free people.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We belong to no one.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Slow down.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Slow down.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Wait a minute.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Wait a minute.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We've covered
over two miles."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Can we take a breather?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",A rest?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Oh.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","well, it's good to get away from that development area, even
for a while."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Shahna, why do the Providers, why do they like to watch
others being hurt, killed?"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Their voices sound mechanical.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Are they computers?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You've seen them.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Do they have bodies?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What is this place?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It's very old.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Does it have a name?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Shahna, could it have been a
city for the Providers?"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","They do have bodies, or did have."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Very pretty country.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Very much like my home planet, Earth."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Where I was born.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Shahna, don't you ever look at the night sky?"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",The lights up there?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Well, those are stars."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",And around them are planets.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","And there are
people that live on them, Just like us."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","From Earth, Triskelion's three suns are just a flicker of light."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Actually, this is the darkest planet I've ever seen."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","The thralls have no freedom, Shahna."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You don't think or do
anything but what the Providers tell you."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Love, for one thing."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Love is the most important thing on Earth.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Especially to a man
and a woman."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","On Earth, we select our own mate."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Someone we care for.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","On Earth,
men and women live together, help each other, make each other happy."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",All right.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",All right.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Tell me about the Providers.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","What do they
look like?"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Where do they live?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Stop it.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Stop it!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I'm responsible!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I made her talk!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Stop it!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You're killing her!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",She did nothing wrong!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It was my fault.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","If you want to punish someone, punish me!"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Please.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It's all right.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It's all right.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You can stop crying now, Shahna."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It's all right.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","It's the custom of my people to help one another when we're in
trouble."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You could call it that.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You're disturbed about what happened today.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I wouldn't like that, Shahna."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I wouldn't like that at all.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I'm sorry, Shahna."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",(takes the magnetic key and unlocks his door)
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What about Lars?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I think Galt is the only one who controls these collars.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","If we
can find the phaser that I threw at Lars, we can use the circuits to
short out these collars."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Spock?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Spock!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Spock?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Welcome to Triskelion, gentlemen."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","By now it must be obvious to you that
you have been expected."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","What you're hearing, gentlemen, is a Provider."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Providing for all their needs means using
thralls, people stolen from other parts of the galaxy"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","To fight each other, and the Providers
gamble on the winner."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",But these Providers haven't the courage to show themselves.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",But you are afraid.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Then show yourselves.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",The power source.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Shielded by solid rock.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Primary mental evolution.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Incredible.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior, mentally
or otherwise."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","It's an unproductive purpose, unworthy of your intellect."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We have found that all life forms in the galaxy are capable of
superior development."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Perhaps you're not as evolved as you believe.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Our destruction will result only in your own.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You may control the
Enterprise, but you cannot match the force of the entire Federation."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",And you call yourselves superior!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You're murderers without the
spirit to really wager for the lives you take."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","My people pride themselves on being the greatest, most successful
gamblers in the universe."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We compete for everything.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Power, fame,
women, everything we desire, and it is our nature to win."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","And for
proof, I offer you our exploration of this galaxy."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Well, then, I wager that with weapons of your own choice, right
here and now, my people can overcome an equal number of thralls
set against us."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Wait!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Wait!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Hear me!
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We can't wager for trifles like quatloos.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",The stakes must be higher.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","If we win, the Enterprise and its crew leaves here in safety."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Further more, all the thralls on the planet must be freed."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You will educate and train them to establish a normal
self-governing culture."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We have done the same with cultures throughout the galaxy.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Are
you willing to admit that we can do something you can't?"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",If we lose?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We will remain here, the entire crew of the
Enterprise."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","The most stubborn, determined competitors in the universe."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We'll become thralls, enter your games, obey your orders without
rebellion."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You'll be assured of generations of the most exciting
wagering you've ever had."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Not for true gamesters.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Name it.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Three against one?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Those are pretty high odds.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Your, your terms are unfair."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Well, in that case, I'll accept your terms."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Yes, that's clear."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",The thralls will be trained?
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I think you'll find it a much more exciting game than the one
you've been playing."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I'm sorry, Shahna."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I didn't lie.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I did what was
necessary."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Someday, I hope you'll understand."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Yes.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Yes.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I can't.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",There's so much you must learn here first.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","The Providers will
teach you."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Learn it, Shahna."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","all your people must learn
before you can reach for the stars."
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Shahna.
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(he gives her a farewell
kiss) Scotty!"
KIRK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Beam us up.
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Standard orbit, Captain."
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Captain.
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",what happened?
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",That was a rough trip.
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","But Captain, if we're not on Gamma Two,
then where are we?"
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Mine, too."
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Nobody's hurt, Captain."
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Yet.
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Captain, the Enterprise."
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","They will be
trying to find us, won't they?"
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You, you have been selected for me?"
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Chekov.
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(nervous of her intentions) Oh, pleased, Pleased to know you,
miss."
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","That's very kind of you, miss, but"
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Cossacks.
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",This is going to kill our romance.
CHEKOV,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",(pointing to an exit) Captain.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Acknowledged, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Spock here.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I presume you mean they vanished in a manner
not consistent with the usual workings of the transporter, Mister
Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Have you reversed controls?
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Power surge?
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Recheck your equipment, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I'll
scan for them on the planet's surface."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Spock out.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I'm beginning to believe that, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I've conducted two
sweeps of the planet's surface."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",There is no sign of life.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","No, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Even that would show up on our sensors.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",The only answers are negative.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","No magnetic storms, no ionic
interference, no breakdown in your equipment."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We shall continue sensor scans, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","At the moment, that is
all we can do, except hope for a rational explanation."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","True, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Constant exposure does result in a certain degree
of contamination."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","They are not within the confines of this
solar system."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I have never heard of a study being done, but it would be a
fascinating project."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Precisely.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",No.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I would say approximately four hundred
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I would welcome a suggestion, Doctor, even an emotional one, as
to where to look."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Captain's log, stardate 3259.2."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","First
Officer Spock in command."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","The Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign
Chekov have been missing for nearly two hours."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Computer probability
projections are useless due to insufficient data."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Interesting.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It seems to be an ionisation trail.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Exactly the question I have just fed to the computers, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","And the answer is, nothing known to us would account for it."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Plot a follow course, Ensign Haines."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Doctor, I am chasing the Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign
Chekov, not some wild aquatic fowl."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",This is the only lead we've had.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Initiate.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Warp factor two.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Projecting back along the path of ionisation, the nearest system
is M two four alpha."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Eleven point six three zero.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I'm suggesting nothing, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I am merely pursuing the only
logical course available to us."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We searched the area.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Such as a failure in the transporter mechanism?
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",There was no sign of them in the area of Gamma Two.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","In that case, Doctor, we have nothing to lose by pursuing our
present course."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Mister Scott, can we manage anything faster
than warp six?"
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Doctor, I do not respond to hunches."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","No transporter malfunction
was responsible for the disappearance."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","They were not within the Gamma
system."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","A focused beam of extremely high-intensity light was directed
into the Gamma system from the trinary system we are now approaching."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",No known natural phenomena could have caused that beam.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Does that
clarify the situation?"
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I see.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(pause) Gentlemen, I am in command of this vessel, and we
shall continue on our present course."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(conspiratorial whisper) Unless
it is your intention to declare a mutiny."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Agreed.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Mister Scott, could you manage warp seven?"
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Ensign, warp seven."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Sensors indicate only one concentration of life forms on the
planet, on the lower hemisphere."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Humanoid readings.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","There will be no landing force, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Assuming the captain and
the others are still alive, it would be unwise to endanger them by
beaming down a large contingent."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Interesting.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",No power source.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It may be shielded.
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I shall beam down, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","If I am unable to communicate, a
landing party may be necessary."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Daniel, as I recall, had only his faith."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","But I welcome your
company, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Mister Scott, you'll be in command."
SPOCK,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Fascinating.
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",This is the craziest landing pad I've ever seen.
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Captain.
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Look.
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I don't think so, Captain."
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","They'll try, but where do they look?"
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We're here, and we don't
know where it is."
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What are you doing?
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Get out!
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",No!
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I don't care whether it's allowed or not.
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I will not do it.
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",He's gone to report me.
UHURA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I said I didn't like the food.
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Scott to Bridge.
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Mister Spock, the Captain, Lieutenant Uhura,
and Chekov."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",they vanished.
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","They got onto the transporter platform and
they just vanished."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Aye, of course I mean that."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You think I'd
call if they just beamed down?"
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I've made all the proper checks.
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","There was
nothing."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","There was no flash of light, nothing."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",They were gone.
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Not down here.
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","All the dials were right and
the transporter was functioning perfectly."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Mister Spock, I've checked that transporter
from one end to the other."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Every circuit works perfectly.
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Whatever that
power surge was, it had nothing to do with the transporter or any other
system aboard this ship."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Where are they then?
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Well, the transporter has neither the power nor the range to
account for that."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We certainly seem to be heading into an empty sector.
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",That must be two dozen light years away.
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Mister Spock, it just doesn't make sense
they could have come this far."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","If there's any chance at all it is to
continue to search in the area they were lost."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It's always possible to miss something.
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","No, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",There was no sign of failure.
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","It's my opinion that we've gone too far as it is, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Doctor McCoy speaks for me, too, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Mister Spock!
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I would be more than content to do so, sir, and maybe a wee bit
more."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","What the voice said was true, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Nothing is functioning.
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Mister Spock, look!"
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Heaven's got very little to do with this.
SCOTT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Aye, sir."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Excellent, Captain Kirk."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Although we expected strength and
competitive spirit, we are greatly pleased."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Admirable, Chekov."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Admirable.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You also, Uhura."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Your spirit is as
great as the captain's."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I can see you all will prove invaluable here.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I
am Galt, Master Thrall of the planet Triskelion."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I have been sent to
welcome you."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","There, Captain."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Now you are prepared for your training.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","The Providers were expecting you, Captain."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","They arranged your
transportation."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Correction, Captain."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",The Providers are not ours.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We are theirs.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You are to be trained, of course."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","What other use is there for
thralls?"
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",There has been no mistake.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Your old titles mean nothing here,
Captain."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You are thralls now.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You are to be taken to the training
enclosure."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",(the restraints are released) Come.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Places have been
prepared for you."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I am Galt, the Master Thrall."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","This place is the planet
Triskelion."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You are to be trained and spend the rest of your lives
here."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",These are your quarters.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Open, thralls."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","That was foolish, Captain."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Escape is quite impossible, as
demonstrated by your collars of obedience."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Return to your quarters.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Hold.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",This thrall was slow in obeying a command.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","For his
punishment, he will be practice target."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","As you charge, you will strike
the practice target when you pass."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You begin, Uhura."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It is not allowed to refuse a training exercise.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It is part of your training.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",The Providers wish it.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We have been tolerant because you are newcomers, but I see you
must be given a lesson."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Lars.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",(Lars unties the thrall) Kloog.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Kloog
will administer correction."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Uhura, take your place on the triad."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(Lars
starts to tie Uhura's hands behind her back.)"
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Tie her.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It is not permitted.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","But, Captain, since you assume
responsibility for your people, you will take the punishment."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","It is
less painful than the collar."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Turn around.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",{Lars ties Kirk's hands.)
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Captain, you will be practice target."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","It is a shame to lose you,
Captain, but it is worth it as an example to the others."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Hold.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Rest interval.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Fifteen trisecs.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Resume places.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We hold, Provider One."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",(after a pause) Two thousand quatloos are bid.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Is there a
challenge?"
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",The newcomers have been vended to Provider One.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You now bear the mark of a fine herd.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","But I must warn you, any
further disobedience now that you are full-fledged thralls
will be punishable by death."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(popping out of thin air) Captain, you do indeed present many
surprises."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Because you have amused the Providers, there will be no
punishment."
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Return to your quarters.
GALT,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Shahna.
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Then what the devil is happening?
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Does that mean their atoms are
just floating around out there?"
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",A negative attitude is no good to us.
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We can't just leave them
out there, wherever they are."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Hope?
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I always thought that was a human failing, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It's been nearly an hour.
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Can people live that long as
disassembled atoms in a transporter beam?"
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Fascinating?
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Those people are friends of ours out there, if
they're still alive."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",The odds are not good.
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Don't quote odds and don't give me anymore dispassionate logic,
Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Just keep looking for them.
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","First time you've ever asked me for anything, and it has to be
an occasion like this."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","What would account for that, Spock?"
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You're going to leave here without them and run off on some wild
goose chase halfway across the galaxy just because
you found a discrepancy in a hydrogen cloud?"
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",This is ridiculous.
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","There's nothing out
there."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Nothing at all.
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Are you suggesting that they could have transported over a
distance of?"
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You're out of your Vulcan mind, Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","If they weren't there it's ridiculous to think they could still
be alive."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Not after all this time.
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","He's right, Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We've lost Jim and the others on Gamma Two.
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Now you've dragged us a dozen light years on some wild hunch that
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","No, it doesn't."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","It's still a fancy way of saying that you're
playing a hunch."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","well, my hunch is that they're back on Gamma Two dead
or alive and I still want another search."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Who said anything about a mutiny, you stubborn, pointed-eared."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",All right.
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","If we don't find them here, do we still have another search
on Gamma Two?"
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Well, at least that gives our landing force a starting point."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Well we're not going to leave them there while we just sit and
wait."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","And it may be just a wild goose chase like we've been telling
you."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Well, Mister Spock, if you're going into the lion's den, you'll
need a medical officer."
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What the devil's going on?
MCCOY,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What in the name of heaven is this?
LARS,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I am your drill thrall.
LARS,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I am called Lars.
LARS,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",That is not your concern.
LARS,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Your drill thralls will attend you
presently."
LARS,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",(he opens Uhura's door and goes in) There is little time.
LARS,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I have been selected for you.
LARS,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It is not allowed to refuse selection.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",(to Kirk): Step away from the door.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(she enters with a tray)
Come."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It is the nourishment interval.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It is nourishment.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We call it that.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It is a sign of our Provider.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","By the colour of the lights it
can be known who holds us."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","When you are vended, you will also have a
colour."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",When you are developed.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","The Provider who offers the most
quatloos puts his colour on us."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It is only to warn and punish.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It is not permitted to talk of that.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Of course.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I am your drill thrall.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I will train you well.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What does that mean?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What is beautiful?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Born?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I have been here always.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",She who bore me was killed in a freestyle match.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You will learn all these things.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It is not permitted.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(a gong sounds and a red light flashes)
The exercise interval."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",This is your training harness.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Put it on.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",This will strengthen you.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Drink it.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Kloog's left eye is weak.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Approach him from that side.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",(not at all out of breath) Oh.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Very well.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You are tired.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",That is the way.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Computers?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Not such as ours.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It is not used.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I do not think it is well to ask such things.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",One does not talk of such things.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Planet?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I have looked at them.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",How can one live on a flicker of light?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Dark?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",But all is lighted.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Here, the chambers."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What else would one do?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",What is love?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We, too, have mates."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","When it is time to increase the herd, my
Provider will select one for me."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I do not think your words are allowed.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I have never seen them, but they are said not to be like us."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",They stay in
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You risked bringing their anger on yourself.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Why did you do it?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",And this.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Is this also helping?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Please, help me once again."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(another kiss) I did not know it
could be like this between people."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Is it always so in the place you
come from?"
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Yes.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You have made me feel strangely.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","If it were allowed, I
would ask that you have another drill thrall."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You lied.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Everything you said.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",The thralls surrender!
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I understand, a little."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You will leave us now?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",To go back to the lights in the sky?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I would like to go to those lights with you.
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Take me?
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Then teach me how, and I will follow you."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Goodbye, Jim Kirk."
SHAHNA,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I will learn, and watch the lights in the
sky, and remember."
HAINES,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(a woman in gold uniform at Spock's station) Mister Spock, I'm
getting a fluctuating energy reading on this hydrogen cloud."
HAINES,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","It's
faint, sir, but it consistently reads an excess of predictable energy
level."
HAINES,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(now in Chekov's seat) Aye, sir."
HAINES,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Course plotted and laid in, Mister Spock."
HAINES,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Three ten mark two
four one."
HAINES,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Standard orbit.
TAMOON,"The

TAMOON,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I have
brought you nourishment."
TAMOON,"The

TAMOON,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Chee-koof!
TAMOON,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",It is a very nice name.
TAMOON,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I am called Tamoon.
TAMOON,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You are a fine specimen.
TAMOON,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I like you better than the others.
TAMOON,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","I
will instruct you well, so my Provider will take you."
TAMOON,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","If my Provider is pleased, we may even be selected for each
other."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Hold.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Provider One bids three hundred quatloos for the newcomers.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Two thousand.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Accepted.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Mark them, Galt."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Is that what you humans call compassion?
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","It is interesting,
but it has no value here."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You present many interesting aspects,
Captain, but you must learn obedience."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Then you will be an excellent
thrall."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Only a reminder.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You Earth people are most unusual, most
stimulating."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","No, Mister Spock, you will not leave the ship."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","None of your control systems will
operate."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Commendations, gentlemen."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Your ingenuity in discovering the
whereabouts of your companions is noteworthy."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We are known to the thralls as Providers because we provide
for all their needs."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","The term is easier for their limited mental
abilities to comprehend."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Your species has great curiosity.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We knew that.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You are interesting in many
ways."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You present no danger while you wear the
collar"
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",And you wear it as long as you live.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",There is no objection.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(a brain pulsates red) We are one thousand of your metres
beneath the surface."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",The thralls are necessary to the games.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We have found
athletic competitions our only challenge, the only thing which
furnishes us with purpose."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We use only inferior beings.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Your ship will be destroyed by a magnetic storm.

Gamesters Of Triskelion","No
communications with your base will be possible."

Gamesters Of Triskelion","Your fate will remain a
mystery to your people."

ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Explain yourself, Captain."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Four hundred quatloos against the newcomers.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Name your stakes, Captain."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","And if you lose, Captain?"
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Your stakes are indeed high, Captain."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","As leader of your people, your spirit seems most indomitable."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We suggest you alone, pitted against three contestants of our choosing."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","On the contrary, they're extremely fair, since your
alternative is death."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Galt will prepare you.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Because you wager your skill for all your people, they will
be permitted to watch the outcome of the game on the ship's viewscreen."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Captain, you will defend."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Thralls must stay in the blue area.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You will take the yellow.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Touching an opposing colour deprives a
contestant of one weapon."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",An opponent must be killed to be removed from the game.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","If only
wounded, he is replaced by a fresh thrall."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Is that clear, Captain?"
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You have won, Captain Kirk, unfortunately."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","However, the terms
of the wager will be honoured."
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",You are free.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Remove your collars.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",They will be trained.
ONE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We have said it.
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Provider Two, three hundred and fifty quatloos."
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",One thousand quatloos.
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Such spirit.
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",I wager fifteen quatloos that he is untrainable.
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Five thousand quatloos that the newcomers will have to be
destroyed."
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(pulsing green) That is not true, Captain."
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Once we had
humanoid form, but we evolved beyond it."
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Yes, most challenging."
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","It was hoped that such new blood would
stimulate our stock of thralls."
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","How unfortunate that you must be
destroyed."
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Two hundred quatloos against!
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Anarchy.
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",They would starve.
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",There is nothing we cannot do!
TWO,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Not for true gamesters, Captain."
THREE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Provider Three, four hundred."
THREE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",One thousand fifty quatloos.
THREE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Twenty quatloos that all three are untrainable.
THREE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","(yellow) Through eons of devoting ourselves exclusively to
intellectual
pursuits, we became the physically simple, mentally superior creatures
you see before you."
THREE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","An interesting speculation, Captain."
THREE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","You and your people
are most challenging."
THREE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","We are aware of your competitive abilities, Captain."
THREE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",A hundred quatloos on the newcomers.
THREE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Five hundred for the newcomers.
THREE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion","Contest by multiple
elimination."
THREE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Thralls govern themselves?
THREE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",Ridiculous!
THREE,"The
Gamesters Of Triskelion",We will accept your stakes on one condition.
SPOCK,Obsession,"Our scanner survey was correct, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,There it is.

tritanium."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Twenty one point four times as hard, to be exact."

specimen."
SPOCK,Obsession,We're in the growing season in this hemisphere of this planet.
SPOCK,Obsession,There are doubtless many pollen aromas.
SPOCK,Obsession,"Captain, dikironium exists only in laboratory experiments."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Rizzo's alive, barely."
SPOCK,Obsession,"You think you know what it was, Captain?"
SPOCK,Obsession,Spock here.
SPOCK,Obsession,"Ready to leave orbit, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Spock again, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Those medical supplies are
badly needed on planet Theta Seven."
SPOCK,Obsession,"They are expecting us to get them
there on time."
SPOCK,Obsession,Continuing scanning.
SPOCK,Obsession,"Still no readings of life forms on the
planet."
SPOCK,Obsession,"You mentioned dikironium, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,"I've scanned for that element, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,"There's no trace of
dikironium on the planet surface or in the atmosphere."
SPOCK,Obsession,"To hide from a sensor scan, it would have to be able to change
its molecular structure, like gold changing itself to lead or wood
changing itself to ivory."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Chekov, take over on scanner."
SPOCK,Obsession,"What was the size of the thing you saw, Ensign?"
SPOCK,Obsession,Composition?
SPOCK,Obsession,"Captain, scientifically"
SPOCK,Obsession,"I hope I'm not disturbing you, Doctor."
SPOCK,Obsession,I need your advice.
SPOCK,Obsession,I do not understand your reasoning.
SPOCK,Obsession,"I do not joke, Doctor."
SPOCK,Obsession,Perhaps I should rephrase my statement.
SPOCK,Obsession,"I
require an opinion."
SPOCK,Obsession,"There are many aspects of human irrationality I do
not yet comprehend."
SPOCK,Obsession,"obsession, for one."
SPOCK,Obsession,"The persistent, single-minded
fixation on one idea."
SPOCK,Obsession,Precisely.
SPOCK,Obsession,"Have you studied the incident involving the USS
Farragut?"
SPOCK,Obsession,"Fortunately, I read somewhat faster."
SPOCK,Obsession,"In brief, Doctor, nearly
half the crew and the captain were annihilated."
SPOCK,Obsession,"The captain's name was
Garrovick."
SPOCK,Obsession,His father.
SPOCK,Obsession,"Among the survivors was a young officer on his first
deep-space assignment, James T. Kirk."
SPOCK,Obsession,And there is still more.
SPOCK,Obsession,"I
suggest you study this."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Correctly phrased, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,As recommended in the manual.
SPOCK,Obsession,"Our
reply, also as recommended, is, sir, we have noted in your recent
behaviour certain items, which, on the surface, seem unusual."
SPOCK,Obsession,"We
respectfully ask permission to inquire further"
SPOCK,Obsession,"Sir, the USS Yorktown is waiting now at the rendezvous point."
SPOCK,Obsession,"It
carries perishable drugs"
SPOCK,Obsession,"Creature, Captain?"
SPOCK,Obsession,"You say you could sense its intelligence, Captain?"
SPOCK,Obsession,"How did it
communicate with you?"
SPOCK,Obsession,"Obviously, Captain, if it is an intelligent creature, if it is
the same one, if it therefore is capable of space travel,
it could pose a great threat to inhabited planets."
SPOCK,Obsession,"We are barely closing in on it, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,"We could be pursuing it
for days."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Conflicting data, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,"It seems to be in a borderline state
between matter and energy."
SPOCK,Obsession,Elements of both.
SPOCK,Obsession,"It could possibly use
gravitational fields for propulsion."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Extremely efficient, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Whether that indicates
intelligence is another matter."
SPOCK,Obsession,"The deflectors will not stop it, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,I should have surmised this.
SPOCK,Obsession,"For the creature to be able to use
gravity as a propulsive force, it would have to have this capacity."
SPOCK,Obsession,"May I suggest that we no longer belabour the question of whether
or not we should have gone after the creature."
SPOCK,Obsession,"The matter has now been
rendered academic."
SPOCK,Obsession,The creature is now after us.
SPOCK,Obsession,"It turned and attacked, Doctor."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Its method was well-considered
and intelligent."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Impossible to tell, Captain, until I can make a closer survey of
the creature."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Captain, the creature's ability to throw itself out of time sync
makes it possible for it to be elsewhere in the instant the phaser
hits."
SPOCK,Obsession,There is therefore no basis for your self-recrimination.
SPOCK,Obsession,"If you
had fired on time and on target eleven years ago,
it would have made no more difference than it did an hour ago."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Captain
Garrovick would still be dead."
SPOCK,Obsession,"The fault was not yours, Jim."
SPOCK,Obsession,"In fact,
there was no fault."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Ensign, am I correct in my assumption that you've been disturbed
by what you consider to be a failure on your part?"
SPOCK,Obsession,"(a nod) I would like
you to consider that the hesitation for which you are blaming yourself
is an hereditary trait of your species."
SPOCK,Obsession,"When suddenly faced by the unknown or imminent danger, the human will
experience a split second of indecision."
SPOCK,Obsession,He hesitates.
SPOCK,Obsession,"Do I have your attention, Ensign?"
SPOCK,Obsession,I know you would prefer to wallow in emotion rather than
SPOCK,Obsession,"Kindness, Mr. Garrovick, is another human emotion, and I believe
we have enough of that."
SPOCK,Obsession,"I simply would like you to accept the fact that
your reaction has its basis in physio."
SPOCK,Obsession,"(suddenly stops and sniffs) Do
you smell something?"
SPOCK,Obsession,Get out of here!
SPOCK,Obsession,I'll attempt to seal it off.
SPOCK,Obsession,"Fortunately, neither of us is dead, Ensign."
SPOCK,Obsession,"The reverse pressure
worked."
SPOCK,Obsession,The vent is closed.
SPOCK,Obsession,"My haemoglobin is based on copper, not iron."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Colloquially expressed, but essentially correct."
SPOCK,Obsession,Do you believe you're in communication with the creature?
SPOCK,Obsession,"It was bearing one two seven mark nine, but I've lost it now."
SPOCK,Obsession,"It has changed course before to mislead us, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Logic would
dictate that"
SPOCK,Obsession,"I do not understand, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,"And you know where home is, Captain?"
SPOCK,Obsession,Precisely.
SPOCK,Obsession,"Doctor, evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn."
SPOCK,Obsession,"If so,
it will reproduce by fission, not just into two parts, but thousands."
SPOCK,Obsession,An ounce should be sufficient.
SPOCK,Obsession,"We can drain it from the ship's
engines and transport it to the planet surface in a magnetic vacuum
field."
SPOCK,Obsession,"There is still one problem, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,Exactly.
SPOCK,Obsession,"A matter-antimatter blast will rip away half the
planet's atmosphere."
SPOCK,Obsession,"If our vessel is in orbit and encounters those
shock waves"
SPOCK,Obsession,"Also, we cannot be certain the transporter will operate under
those conditions."
SPOCK,Obsession,"If a man is beaming up when that hits, we may lose
him."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Captain, there is so little hemoglobin in my green blood, the
creature could not harm me extensively."
SPOCK,Obsession,"It therefore seems logical for
me to be the one"
SPOCK,Obsession,It will require two men to transport the antimatter unit.
SPOCK,Obsession,"Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,Obsession,"Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,Obsession,"Holding at thirty
thousand kilometres."
SPOCK,Obsession,Spock here.
SPOCK,Obsession,Reset.
SPOCK,Obsession,Energise.
SPOCK,Obsession,"We are, Doctor."
SPOCK,Obsession,Cross-circuiting to A.
SPOCK,Obsession,Cross-circuiting to B.
SPOCK,Obsession,"Mister Scott, there was no deity involved."
SPOCK,Obsession,"It was my
cross-circuiting to B that recovered them."
KIRK,Obsession,Fantastic.
KIRK,Obsession,20 times as hard as diamond.
KIRK,Obsession,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Obsession,"(into communicator) Scotty, you can mark
this vein as confirmed."
KIRK,Obsession,"Inform Starfleet I recommend that they dispatch
a survey vessel immediately."
KIRK,Obsession,Lesley.
KIRK,Obsession,Do you smell that?
KIRK,Obsession,A sweet odour like honey.
KIRK,Obsession,"It was years ago, on
another planet."
KIRK,Obsession,A thing with a an odour like that.
KIRK,Obsession,Rizzo.
KIRK,Obsession,Take your men.
KIRK,Obsession,Make a swing around our perimeter.
KIRK,Obsession,"Scan for
dikironium in the atmosphere."
KIRK,Obsession,Set your phasers on disrupter-B.
KIRK,Obsession,"If you
see any gaseous cloud, fire immediately."
KIRK,Obsession,You're on Red Alert.
KIRK,Obsession,"Make a
sweep."
KIRK,Obsession,"Negative, Scotty."
KIRK,Obsession,We're checking something out.
KIRK,Obsession,Acknowledged.
KIRK,Obsession,Continue standing by.
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk out.
KIRK,Obsession,It's gone.
KIRK,Obsession,I could have been wrong.
KIRK,Obsession,"The last time I caught an
odour like that was eleven years ago."
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk here.
KIRK,Obsession,Fire into it immediately!
KIRK,Obsession,Spock.
KIRK,Obsession,Dead.
KIRK,Obsession,"And you'll find every red corpuscle gone from their
body."
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Obsession,"Scotty, lock in on us."
KIRK,Obsession,Medical emergency.
KIRK,Obsession,"Something that can't possibly exist, but it does."
KIRK,Obsession,How's Ensign Rizzo?
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk to bridge.
KIRK,Obsession,Hold your position.
KIRK,Obsession,Then you'll inform them that we might be a little late.
KIRK,Obsession,"Gentlemen, we are remaining in orbit until I find out more about
those deaths, on my responsibility."
KIRK,Obsession,"I am perfectly aware that it might
cost lives on Theta Seven."
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk out.
KIRK,Obsession,Autopsy report.
KIRK,Obsession,"Marks, cuts, incisions of any kind?"
KIRK,Obsession,"I suggest you look at the record tapes of past similar
occurrences."
KIRK,Obsession,"You'll find the USS Farragut lists casualties eleven years
ago from exactly the same impossible causes."
KIRK,Obsession,"First, can you bring Ensign Rizzo to consciousness for a moment?"
KIRK,Obsession,Will it hurt him if you do so?
KIRK,Obsession,Then do so.
KIRK,Obsession,Rizzo.
KIRK,Obsession,This is the captain.
KIRK,Obsession,Can you hear me?
KIRK,Obsession,"Do you remember what
happened to you?"
KIRK,Obsession,You were attacked by something.
KIRK,Obsession,"When it happened, did you notice
an odour of any kind?"
KIRK,Obsession,Rizzo.
KIRK,Obsession,Rizzo!
KIRK,Obsession,"Do you remember a sickly sweet
odour?"
KIRK,Obsession,Did you smell it?
KIRK,Obsession,"Did you feel a presence, an intelligence?"
KIRK,Obsession,He's already told me what I wanted to know.
KIRK,Obsession,You check those record tapes.
KIRK,Obsession,"I want your medical analysis as
quickly as possible."
KIRK,Obsession,(leaves)
KIRK,Obsession,Not now.
KIRK,Obsession,Have the security duty officer report to me immediately.
KIRK,Obsession,Spock?
KIRK,Obsession,"Let's assume that it's something so completely different that our
sensors wouldn't identify it as a life form."
KIRK,Obsession,Suppose it was composed of that rare element.
KIRK,Obsession,"A strange, gaseous
creature."
KIRK,Obsession,Suppose it camouflaged itself.
KIRK,Obsession,"Let's assume that it's
intelligent, that it knows we're looking for it."
KIRK,Obsession,You've just suggested something that never occurred to me.
KIRK,Obsession,"It may
provide some answers to a tape record which I think you'll find Doctor
McCoy is looking at this very moment."
KIRK,Obsession,Are you the new security officer?
KIRK,Obsession,Was your father
KIRK,Obsession,"You'll get none aboard this ship, Mister."
KIRK,Obsession,You knew Rizzo?
KIRK,Obsession,You'll get a crack at what killed him.
KIRK,Obsession,Interested?
KIRK,Obsession,I want four men armed with phaser two set for disrupter effect.
KIRK,Obsession,Join me in the transporter room in five minutes.
KIRK,Obsession,"You'll accompany me to
the planet surface."
KIRK,Obsession,Spock was right.
KIRK,Obsession,Notice the molecular shift?
KIRK,Obsession,Over that rise.
KIRK,Obsession,"Take two men, circle around to the left."
KIRK,Obsession,"I'll
take the other two and go the other way."
KIRK,Obsession,That creature is dangerous.
KIRK,Obsession,"If
you see it, fire full phasers."
KIRK,Obsession,"Swensen, Bardoli come with me."
KIRK,Obsession,A phaser!
KIRK,Obsession,Come on!
KIRK,Obsession,"(arriving at the scene) Garrovick, did you?"
KIRK,Obsession,"Mister Garrovick, we've studied your report."
KIRK,Obsession,"Mister Spock, begin."
KIRK,Obsession,"But you didn't come to actual contact with it, did you?"
KIRK,Obsession,Did you say it hovered?
KIRK,Obsession,"You did fire at it, didn't you?"
KIRK,Obsession,What distance were you from the creature?
KIRK,Obsession,"You fired at a large, hovering target at that distance and
missed?"
KIRK,Obsession,You mean you froze?
KIRK,Obsession,What exactly were you doing?
KIRK,Obsession,Do you have any further information?
KIRK,Obsession,Do you gentlemen have any further questions?
KIRK,Obsession,"Ensign, you're relieved of all duties and confined to quarters
until further notice."
KIRK,Obsession,He froze.
KIRK,Obsession,One man was killed.
KIRK,Obsession,Another may die.
KIRK,Obsession,You'll both be filing reports.
KIRK,Obsession,"Make your comments and
recommendations then."
KIRK,Obsession,"We're not leaving orbit, Mister Scott."
KIRK,Obsession,Not that quickly.
KIRK,Obsession,Thank you.
KIRK,Obsession,"I'm aware of the situation, Engineer, and I'm getting a little
tired of my senior officers conspiring against me."
KIRK,Obsession,Forgive me.
KIRK,Obsession,Perhaps I shouldn't have used the word conspire.
KIRK,Obsession,Scanner readings?
KIRK,Obsession,Are you aware it can change its molecular structure?
KIRK,Obsession,Are you scanning for any unusual movement?
KIRK,Obsession,Any type of gaseous cloud?
KIRK,Obsession,"Then run it twenty
times if that's what it takes!"
KIRK,Obsession,"Personal log, stardate 3620.7."
KIRK,Obsession,"Have I the right to
jeopardise my crew, my ship for a feeling I can't even put into words?"
KIRK,Obsession,"No man achieves Starfleet command without relying on intuition, but
have I made a rational decision?"
KIRK,Obsession,"Am I letting the horrors of the past
distort my judgment of the present?"
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk to bridge.
KIRK,Obsession,Scanning report.
KIRK,Obsession,Maintain search.
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk out.
KIRK,Obsession,It can't have just vanished.
KIRK,Obsession,Get to the point.
KIRK,Obsession,Ensign Garrovick is a ship-command decision.
KIRK,Obsession,"You're straying out
of your field, Doctor."
KIRK,Obsession,Because I delayed in firing at it.
KIRK,Obsession,"If I hadn't delayed, it would have been killed."
KIRK,Obsession,Don't you understand?
KIRK,Obsession,It killed two hundred crewmen.
KIRK,Obsession,Yes.
KIRK,Obsession,"He was my commanding officer from the day I left the
Academy."
KIRK,Obsession,One of the finest men I ever knew.
KIRK,Obsession,"I could have killed that
thing if I'd fired soon enough the first time."
KIRK,Obsession,I can't help how I feel.
KIRK,Obsession,"There's an intelligence about it, Bones."
KIRK,Obsession,A malevolence.
KIRK,Obsession,It's evil.
KIRK,Obsession,It must be destroyed.
KIRK,Obsession,Obsessed?
KIRK,Obsession,"Don't push our friendship past the point where I have to take
official"
KIRK,Obsession,"Do I take it, Doctor, Commander, that both of you or either of
you consider me unfit or incapacitated?"
KIRK,Obsession,Blast it!
KIRK,Obsession,Forget the manual!
KIRK,Obsession,Ask your questions.
KIRK,Obsession,"Skip the recitation, Spock."
KIRK,Obsession,I know the facts.
KIRK,Obsession,"Because I'm convinced that this is the same creature that
attacked the Farragut eleven years ago."
KIRK,Obsession,My report is on the tapes.
KIRK,Obsession,"As it attacked us eleven years ago, as
I lost consciousness, I could feel the intelligence of the thing."
KIRK,Obsession,"I
could sense it thinking, planning."
KIRK,Obsession,"Whatever it is, Doctor, whatever it is, wouldn't you call it
deadly?"
KIRK,Obsession,"And what if it is the same creature that attacked eleven years
ago from a planet over a thousand light years from here?"
KIRK,Obsession,"A lot of ifs, I agree, but in my command judgment, they out weigh
other factors."
KIRK,Obsession,"Intuition, however illogical, Mister Spock,
is recognized as a command prerogative."
KIRK,Obsession,"And you haven't, Doctor."
KIRK,Obsession,"You've expressed the proper concern,
you've asked the proper questions."
KIRK,Obsession,You've both done your duty.
KIRK,Obsession,"Now may
I ask what medical log entry you intend to make?"
KIRK,Obsession,"In that case, gentlemen"
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk here.
KIRK,Obsession,"All decks, Red Alert."
KIRK,Obsession,Red alert.
KIRK,Obsession,Prepare to leave orbit.
KIRK,Obsession,"Range, Mister Chekov?"
KIRK,Obsession,If necessary.
KIRK,Obsession,"Do what you can to increase our speed, Scott."
KIRK,Obsession,"Extreme magnification, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Obsession,"Spock, how do you read that?"
KIRK,Obsession,"And you don't find that sophisticated, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Obsession,We won't be using the impulse engines.
KIRK,Obsession,Turn the alarm off.
KIRK,Obsession,Go to warp six.
KIRK,Obsession,Reduce speed.
KIRK,Obsession,Approach slowly.
KIRK,Obsession,Maybe it's decided to fight.
KIRK,Obsession,Phasers ready?
KIRK,Obsession,Battle stations.
KIRK,Obsession,All decks to battle stations.
KIRK,Obsession,"This is not a
drill."
KIRK,Obsession,All decks to battle stations.
KIRK,Obsession,"Move in closely, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Obsession,Sublight one quarter speed.
KIRK,Obsession,Lock all phasers on target.
KIRK,Obsession,"Fire phasers, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Obsession,Photon torpedoes.
KIRK,Obsession,Minimum spread pattern.
KIRK,Obsession,Fire photon torpedoes.
KIRK,Obsession,Deflectors up.
KIRK,Obsession,"(over Chekov's speech) Lieutenant Uhura, all decks (rest of
speech lost under Chekov's increasing volume)"
KIRK,Obsession,Negative pressure in all ship's vents.
KIRK,Obsession,Alert all decks.
KIRK,Obsession,Report.
KIRK,Obsession,Bones?
KIRK,Obsession,"That's enough, Bones."
KIRK,Obsession,"Yes, well, it could have been many light years away from us."
KIRK,Obsession,Instead it chose to turn and attack here.
KIRK,Obsession,Why?
KIRK,Obsession,"Scotty, try flushing the radioactive waste into the ventilation
system."
KIRK,Obsession,See what effect that has.
KIRK,Obsession,"If you want to play analyst, Spock, use someone else, not me."
KIRK,Obsession,"My
concern is with the ship and the crew."
KIRK,Obsession,"On my way, Garrovick."
KIRK,Obsession,"Security to three four
one."
KIRK,Obsession,Medical alert.
KIRK,Obsession,"Scotty, reverse cabin pressure three four one."
KIRK,Obsession,"Security, hold it."
KIRK,Obsession,Tricorder.
KIRK,Obsession,"If we let that thing into the ship, he'll have a lot of company."
KIRK,Obsession,"See if the reverse pressure has pulled it back into the
ventilation system."
KIRK,Obsession,Don't misunderstand my next question.
KIRK,Obsession,"Mister Spock, why aren't
you dead?"
KIRK,Obsession,Yes.
KIRK,Obsession,The scent is different.
KIRK,Obsession,I think I understand something now.
KIRK,Obsession,"I don't know what it is, Mister Spock, but you remember I said
the thing was alive."
KIRK,Obsession,"It may not be communication as we understand it,
but I did know it was alive and intelligent, and I think I know
something else now."
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk here.
KIRK,Obsession,Open the vent.
KIRK,Obsession,On my way to the bridge.
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk out.
KIRK,Obsession,"Ensign
Garrovick."
KIRK,Obsession,You were on the bridge when we were attacked.
KIRK,Obsession,"Very commendable, Ensign."
KIRK,Obsession,What was your impression of the battle?
KIRK,Obsession,"I'm asking for your military appraisal of the techniques used
against the creature."
KIRK,Obsession,"And Ensign, what is your appraisal of your conduct on the planet?"
KIRK,Obsession,If you hadn't delayed firing?
KIRK,Obsession,"No difference, Ensign."
KIRK,Obsession,"No weapon
known would have made any difference."
KIRK,Obsession,Then or eleven years ago.
KIRK,Obsession,"Report for duty, Ensign."
KIRK,Obsession,"Report, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Obsession,"Direction, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Obsession,"(into intercom) Mister Scott, I'll need all the speed you can
deliver."
KIRK,Obsession,Keep at it until we begin to shake apart.
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk out.
KIRK,Obsession,"I believe
I know where it's going."
KIRK,Obsession,"No, I'm playing intuition."
KIRK,Obsession,"Mister Chekov, compute a course for
Tychos star system."
KIRK,Obsession,Ahead full.
KIRK,Obsession,"Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet and the USS Yorktown."
KIRK,Obsession,"Inform them that we are pursuing the creature to planet four of
that system."
KIRK,Obsession,"That's the location of its attack on the USS Farragut
eleven years ago."
KIRK,Obsession,"In Garrovick's quarters, I said the scent of the creature was
somehow different."
KIRK,Obsession,Something in my mind said home.
KIRK,Obsession,"Yes, I think I do."
KIRK,Obsession,"I don't know how I know, but home is where it
fought a starship once before."
KIRK,Obsession,"Ito Uhura) Inform them of our tactical
situation and inform them I'm committing this vessel to the destruction
of the creature."
KIRK,Obsession,We will rendezvous.
KIRK,Obsession,"Round-trip time, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Obsession,We will rendezvous with the USS Yorktown in forty eight hours.
KIRK,Obsession,You don't agree with Mister Spock?
KIRK,Obsession,Antimatter seems our only possibility.
KIRK,Obsession,Contact medical stores.
KIRK,Obsession,"I want as much haemoplasm as they can
spare in the transporter room in fifteen minutes."
KIRK,Obsession,We must get it to the antimatter.
KIRK,Obsession,"It seems attracted to red blood
cells."
KIRK,Obsession,What better bait could we have?
KIRK,Obsession,"The blast, yes."
KIRK,Obsession,"A chance we'll have to take, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Obsession,That's exactly why I've decided to set the trap myself.
KIRK,Obsession,"Negative, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Obsession,"In case this plan fails, I'll need you
aboard the ship."
KIRK,Obsession,"In that event, we'll need another plan."
KIRK,Obsession,"I had you in mind, Mister Garrovick."
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Obsession,Proceed immediately to maximum orbit.
KIRK,Obsession,Let's hope it's as powerful as man will ever get.
KIRK,Obsession,Detonator.
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Obsession,Antimatter container positioned and armed.
KIRK,Obsession,I'll call you back when it's baited.
KIRK,Obsession,Kirk out.
KIRK,Obsession,We'll need something else for bait.
KIRK,Obsession,"Garrovick, get back to the ship."
KIRK,Obsession,"Tell them to prepare to
detonate."
KIRK,Obsession,"I said, get back to the ship."
KIRK,Obsession,"Ensign, I gave you an order."
KIRK,Obsession,Consider yourself on report.
KIRK,Obsession,This is no time for heroics.
KIRK,Obsession,"I have
no intention of sacrificing myself, at least not yet."
KIRK,Obsession,"(into
communicator) Spock?"
KIRK,Obsession,Spock?
KIRK,Obsession,Scan us and lock on to us.
KIRK,Obsession,It's going to be close.
KIRK,Obsession,"Very, very
close."
KIRK,Obsession,Stand by.
KIRK,Obsession,"Stand by, Enterprise."
KIRK,Obsession,"Stand by, Enterprise."
KIRK,Obsession,(The cloud reaches them) Now!
KIRK,Obsession,"Energise and
detonate!"
KIRK,Obsession,"That's a fair statement, Bones."
KIRK,Obsession,"Now that the creature is dead,
let's save some lives."
KIRK,Obsession,We'll deliver your medicine.
KIRK,Obsession,"Bridge, this is
Kirk."
KIRK,Obsession,"Have Mister Chekov lay in a course for a rendezvous with the
Yorktown, maximum warp."
KIRK,Obsession,"Oh, Ensign, meet me in my quarters when you've cleaned up."
KIRK,Obsession,"I'd
like to talk to you about your father."
KIRK,Obsession,"Several tall stories I think
you'd like to hear."
SCOTT,Obsession,"Acknowledged, Captain."
SCOTT,Obsession,"They'll send one fast enough for
this rich a find."
SCOTT,Obsession,"Ready to beam back aboard, Captain?"
SCOTT,Obsession,"The USS Yorktown is expecting to rendezvous with us in less
than eight hours, Captain."
SCOTT,Obsession,That doesn't give us much time.
SCOTT,Obsession,"Cutting in if I may, Captain."
SCOTT,Obsession,"The USS Yorktown is
expecting to rendezvous with us in less than seven hours."
SCOTT,Obsession,"Captain, while we're waiting I've taken the
liberty of cleaning the radioactive disposal vent on number two
impulse engine, but we'll be ready to leave orbit in under half an
hour."
SCOTT,Obsession,"The medicine for Theta Seven colony is not only needed
desperately and has limited"
SCOTT,Obsession,"Agreed, sir."
SCOTT,Obsession,"Captain, we can't maintain warp eight speed
much longer."
SCOTT,Obsession,Pressures are approaching the critical point.
SCOTT,Obsession,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,Obsession,"Captain, we can't do it."
SCOTT,Obsession,"If we keep this speed, we'll blow up
any minute now."
SCOTT,Obsession,That's impossible.
SCOTT,Obsession,"Captain, something's entered through the number two impulse
vent."
SCOTT,Obsession,"When it entered impulse engine number two's vent, it attacked
two crewmen."
SCOTT,Obsession,"It then got into the ventilating system, and now we have
air for only two hours."
SCOTT,Obsession,Aye.
SCOTT,Obsession,(leaves)
SCOTT,Obsession,Engineering to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,Obsession,Engineering to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,Obsession,"Scott, Captain."
SCOTT,Obsession,"The creature's moving back toward the
number two impulse vent."
SCOTT,Obsession,The radioactive flushing may be affecting it.
SCOTT,Obsession,Got them.
SCOTT,Obsession,"A piece of them, anyway."
SCOTT,Obsession,"Captain, thank heaven."
RIZZO,Obsession,"Yes, sir?"
RIZZO,Obsession,"Seemed to read dikironium for a minute, and then I lost it."
RIZZO,Obsession,"It's
almost like something out there knows I'm scanning it."
RIZZO,Obsession,It kind of keeps changing itself into something different.
RIZZO,Obsession,"That isn't
possible."
RIZZO,Obsession,Nothing can do that.
RIZZO,Obsession,Captain?
RIZZO,Obsession,Captain.
RIZZO,Obsession,"There's a strange cloud, sir."
RIZZO,Obsession,"Cloud, cloud."
RIZZO,Obsession,Help me.
RIZZO,Obsession,Help!
RIZZO,Obsession,Remember.
RIZZO,Obsession,I'm cold.
RIZZO,Obsession,I'm so cold.
RIZZO,Obsession,Yes.
RIZZO,Obsession,Yes.
RIZZO,Obsession,A smell.
RIZZO,Obsession,A strange smell.
RIZZO,Obsession,"It was like being smothered
in honey."
RIZZO,Obsession,It was trying to draw strength from us.
RIZZO,Obsession,I felt it.
RIZZO,Obsession,"It was, it
was, it was there."
CHAPEL,Obsession,"Autopsy report, Doctor."
CHAPEL,Obsession,"Still unconscious, sir."
CHAPEL,Obsession,Continuing as rapidly as possible.
CHAPEL,Obsession,"His blood count is still
sixty percent less than normal."
CHAPEL,Obsession,(leaves)
CHAPEL,Obsession,"Transfusion completed, sir."
CHAPEL,Obsession,"His pulse and
respiration are still far below normal."
CHAPEL,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
CHAPEL,Obsession,What's with the captain?
CHAPEL,Obsession,I've never seen him like that before.
CHAPEL,Obsession,Hi.
CHAPEL,Obsession,"Everyone else is at alert station, so I
brought you some dinner."
CHAPEL,Obsession,Doctor's orders.
CHAPEL,Obsession,Are we still chasing that thing half way across the galaxy?
CHAPEL,Obsession,Yes.
CHAPEL,Obsession,Has the captain lost his sense of balance?
CHAPEL,Obsession,Maybe.
CHAPEL,Obsession,"Is the entire
crew about ready to explode?"
CHAPEL,Obsession,Positively.
CHAPEL,Obsession,You're lucky you're out of it.
CHAPEL,Obsession,"You know, self-pity's a terrible first course."
CHAPEL,Obsession,"Why don't you
try the soup instead?"
CHAPEL,Obsession,Doctor McCoy thought you might say something like that.
CHAPEL,Obsession,"This is
his officially logged prescription for you."
CHAPEL,Obsession,It has one word on it.
CHAPEL,Obsession,Eat.
CHAPEL,Obsession,"Now if you don't follow his orders, Doctor McCoy could and possibly
would have you hauled down to Sickbay and fed intravenously."
CHAPEL,Obsession,Hmm?
CHAPEL,Obsession,(picks up the tape again) This?
CHAPEL,Obsession,Applying psychology.
MCCOY,Obsession,Transfusions?
MCCOY,Obsession,"Jim, the Yorktown's ship surgeon will want to know how late."
MCCOY,Obsession,Those vaccines he's transferring to us are highly perishable.
MCCOY,Obsession,You saw their colour.
MCCOY,Obsession,"There wasn't a red corpuscle left in their
bodies."
MCCOY,Obsession,Not a one.
MCCOY,Obsession,What happened is medically impossible.
MCCOY,Obsession,"Thank you, Captain."
MCCOY,Obsession,I'll check those tapes immediately.
MCCOY,Obsession,"Yes, but it"
MCCOY,Obsession,"In his present condition, I don't think it would make much
difference."
MCCOY,Obsession,"Give him one cc of cordazine, nurse."
MCCOY,Obsession,He's beginning to sleep again.
MCCOY,Obsession,I can't risk another shot.
MCCOY,Obsession,"I wouldn't depend too much what he says in that half-conscious
state."
MCCOY,Obsession,"He could be dreaming, saying what he thought you wanted to hear."
MCCOY,Obsession,I intend to find out.
MCCOY,Obsession,I'll be in the medical record library.
MCCOY,Obsession,"Ensign, did you sense any intelligence in this gaseous cloud?"
MCCOY,Obsession,"Did you get any subconscious impressions that this was a
creature."
MCCOY,Obsession,"A living, thinking thing, rather than just a strange cloud of
chemical elements?"
MCCOY,Obsession,"You were a little hard on the boy, Jim."
MCCOY,Obsession,"Interrupting another autopsy report is no disturbance, Mister
Spock."
MCCOY,Obsession,It's a relief.
MCCOY,Obsession,Then I need a drink.
MCCOY,Obsession,You need advice from me?
MCCOY,Obsession,You must be kidding.
MCCOY,Obsession,Jim and his creature?
MCCOY,Obsession,No.
MCCOY,Obsession,"With all these deaths and injuries, I've only had a chance
to scan the tapes."
MCCOY,Obsession,There are eight or ten hours of record tape there.
MCCOY,Obsession,The same as our Ensign.
MCCOY,Obsession,Mind if I come in?
MCCOY,Obsession,"Sometimes they do, if we're lucky."
MCCOY,Obsession,Monsters come in many forms.
MCCOY,Obsession,"You know the greatest monster of them all, Jim?"
MCCOY,Obsession,Guilt.
MCCOY,Obsession,"Jim, When a young officer is exposed to unknown dangers for the
first time, he's under tremendous emotional stress."
MCCOY,Obsession,"Now we all know
that."
MCCOY,Obsession,Am I?
MCCOY,Obsession,"I was speaking of Lieutenant James T. Kirk of the starship
Farragut."
MCCOY,Obsession,"Eleven years ago, you were the young officer
at the phaser station when something attacked."
MCCOY,Obsession,"According to the tapes,
this young Lieutenant Kirk insisted upon blaming himself."
MCCOY,Obsession,You had a normal emotion.
MCCOY,Obsession,You were startled.
MCCOY,Obsession,"You delayed firing
for a grand total of perhaps two seconds."
MCCOY,Obsession,The ship's exec didn't seem to think so.
MCCOY,Obsession,"His log entry was quite
clear on the subject."
MCCOY,Obsession,"Lieutenant Kirk is a fine young officer who
performed with uncommon bravery."
MCCOY,Obsession,"Captain Garrovick was very important to you, wasn't he, Jim?"
MCCOY,Obsession,"You don't know that, Jim."
MCCOY,Obsession,"You don't know that any more than you
know that Garrovick could have destroyed it."
MCCOY,Obsession,To be so obsessed.
MCCOY,Obsession,"That you could destroy yourself, your career, a young boy who
reminds you of yourself eleven years ago."
MCCOY,Obsession,"I'm not, Jim."
MCCOY,Obsession,"This is professional, Captain."
MCCOY,Obsession,"I am preparing a
medical log entry on my estimation of the physical and emotional
condition of a starship captain."
MCCOY,Obsession,"Which requires a witness of command
grade."
MCCOY,Obsession,"They need those vaccines on Theta Seven, Captain."
MCCOY,Obsession,"Now why are we
delaying here?"
MCCOY,Obsession,You state that it happened just as you lost consciousness.
MCCOY,Obsession,"A
semiconscious mind is a very tricky thing."
MCCOY,Obsession,"A man never knows how much
is real or how much is imagination."
MCCOY,Obsession,"Yes, there's no doubt about that."
MCCOY,Obsession,"Jim, we're not trying to gang up on you."
MCCOY,Obsession,"At this point, my medical log remains open."
MCCOY,Obsession,What's that?
MCCOY,Obsession,(reading) A survey on Cygnian Respiratory Diseases?
MCCOY,Obsession,"I thought
you took Garrovick some food."
MCCOY,Obsession,What were you doing with this?
MCCOY,Obsession,One man has a chance for survival.
MCCOY,Obsession,The other is dead.
MCCOY,Obsession,"You can
add that little price tag to your monster hunt."
MCCOY,Obsession,It's not enough!
MCCOY,Obsession,"You didn't care as long as you could hang your
trophy on the wall."
MCCOY,Obsession,"Well, it's not on it, Captain, it's in it."
MCCOY,Obsession,"Creature, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,Obsession,"I'm sorry, Jim."
MCCOY,Obsession,I was wrong.
MCCOY,Obsession,(leaves)
MCCOY,Obsession,"Jim, Spock may be dying."
MCCOY,Obsession,It's that green blood of his.
MCCOY,Obsession,"I'll bet he left a bad taste in the creature's mouth, too."
MCCOY,Obsession,"I assume that you now believe we should pursue the creature and
destroy it."
MCCOY,Obsession,It's the time factor that bothers me.
MCCOY,Obsession,"Those drugs are
perishable."
MCCOY,Obsession,"I presume you intend to use that haemoplasm to attract the
creature?"
MCCOY,Obsession,Do something.
MCCOY,Obsession,"Crazy way to travel, spreading a man's molecules all over the
universe."
MCCOY,Obsession,"Well then, thank pitchforks and pointed ears."
MCCOY,Obsession,"As long as it
worked, Jim."
UHURA,Obsession,"Oh, Captain."
UHURA,Obsession,"Subspace message from
Starfleet."
UHURA,Obsession,They're inquiring
UHURA,Obsession,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,Obsession,"Captain, I have a report on Ensign Rizzo."
UHURA,Obsession,"He's dead, sir."
UHURA,Obsession,"Captain, the Yorktown requesting information on how soon we
expect to rendezvous with them."
UHURA,Obsession,There.
UHURA,Obsession,"It's coming, sir."
UHURA,Obsession,"Frequency open and clear, sir."
UHURA,Obsession,Uhura here.
UHURA,Obsession,"Aye, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Ensign Garrovick reporting, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, sir, but I don't expect any special treatment on that
account."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"We were good friends, graduated the Academy
together."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, I am, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Reading is changing, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Dikironium reading now, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Bearing ninety four mark seven,
angle of elevation six degrees."
GARROVICK,Obsession,Holding steady.
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"I'd say it measured from ten to sixty cubic metres, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"It
varied in size, fluctuated as it moved."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"It was like a, a gaseous cloud."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Parts of it I could see
through."
GARROVICK,Obsession,Other parts were more dense.
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Did I what, sir?"
GARROVICK,Obsession,"No, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"No, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,I was furthest away from it.
GARROVICK,Obsession,"It seemed to come out
of nowhere, hovered for a moment, then moved toward my men."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"It was
fast, incredibly fast."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, sir, I did."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"About twenty yards, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,Yes.
GARROVICK,Obsession,"I, er, well, I didn't fire while it was hovering, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"No, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,I didn't exactly freeze.
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Well, I was startled for a second."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"And then by the time I
fired, the thing was already moving."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"No, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"I only hesitated for a moment, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,I'm sorry.
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,(leaves)
GARROVICK,Obsession,I'm not hungry.
GARROVICK,Obsession,What's happening?
GARROVICK,Obsession,"What do you mean, out of it?"
GARROVICK,Obsession,I caused it.
GARROVICK,Obsession,"You know that,
too, don't you?"
GARROVICK,Obsession,"If I'd fired my phaser quickly enough on Argus Ten,
this wouldn't have happened."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"I told you, Christine, I'm not hungry."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Captain, request permission to return to my post."
GARROVICK,Obsession,Come in.
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Mister Spock, it's very kind of you to come here"
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Sir, it's coming through the vent."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"(into intercom) Sir, the creature's in
my cabin."
GARROVICK,Obsession,It's got Mister Spock.
GARROVICK,Obsession,I must have jammed the vent control when I hit it.
GARROVICK,Obsession,"He saved my life, Captain."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"I should be lying dead in there,
not him."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, I'm sorry, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"I know I was confined to quarters, but
when the alert sounded"
GARROVICK,Obsession,"I don't understand, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Ineffective, Captain."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"I realise, Captain, you did everything
you could do."
GARROVICK,Obsession,I know that.
GARROVICK,Obsession,"It's just that nothing works against a
monster
that can do the things that thing does."
GARROVICK,Obsession,I delayed firing.
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, Captain."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Thank you, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"I'd like permission to go with you, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Just think, Captain, less than one ounce of antimatter here
is more powerful than ten thousand cobalt bombs."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Aye, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Captain, look!"
GARROVICK,Obsession,The haemoplasm.
GARROVICK,Obsession,The bait's already taken.
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Sir, that thing only feeds on blood."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Captain, you're not going to be the bait."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,"I can smell it, Captain."
GARROVICK,Obsession,It's sickening.
GARROVICK,Obsession,Honey sweet.
GARROVICK,Obsession,"Thank you, sir."
GARROVICK,Obsession,I would.
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Nothing, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,Continuing to scan.
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Yes, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,We've run a full scanner probe twice.
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Continued scanning, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,No unusual readings.
CHEKOV,Obsession,Bridge to Captain.
CHEKOV,Obsession,Come in.
CHEKOV,Obsession,"I have a reading on the whatever it is, Captain."
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Leaving the
planet surface, heading into space."
CHEKOV,Obsession,Point zero four light years ahead.
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Our phasers won't reach
it, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,Magnification twelve.
CHEKOV,Obsession,"There, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,Got it.
CHEKOV,Obsession,Open hatch on impulse engine number two.
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Mister Scott was doing
an AID clean-up on it."
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,The creature is slowing.
CHEKOV,Obsession,"It's down to warp
two."
CHEKOV,Obsession,I don't understand.
CHEKOV,Obsession,It was outrunning us.
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Phasers show ready, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,"It's coming to a full halt, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,Magnification one.
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Within phaser range, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,Locked on target.
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Phasers ineffectual, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Minimum pattern ready, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Deflectors up, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,Five seconds to contact.
CHEKOV,Obsession,All hatches and vents secure.
CHEKOV,Obsession,"All
lights on the board show green."
CHEKOV,Obsession,Sir!
CHEKOV,Obsession,The number two impulse vent!
CHEKOV,Obsession,"we
have a red light!"
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Results positive, Captain."
CHEKOV,Obsession,"The creature has left the ship at
high warp speed and is already nearly out of scanner range."
CHEKOV,Obsession,"The way
that thing can move, Captain, I wouldn't believe it."
CHEKOV,Obsession,Computed and on the board.
CHEKOV,Obsession,"Ahead full, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,"One point seven days, sir."
CHEKOV,Obsession,"All decks, stand by."
CHEKOV,Obsession,Shock waves.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The crew has performed excellently, but is
exhausted."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","And I, too, am looking forward to a nice period of rest on
some lovely planet."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Try another channel, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Yes, that's right, Bones."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Spock?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Get to the Sickbay.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","No, no, no."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",That's an order.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Go ahead.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Sir, the Enterprise just completed an exhausting mission."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We're
on our way in for R and R. There must be another starship in that
sector."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Order acknowledged.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Kirk out.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Kyle, you heard the order."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Set course for Gamma Seven-A, warp five."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Dead?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",It's a fourth magnitude sun.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","There are billions of
inhabitants there."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Spock, you may have been right."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We've lost
contact with the Intrepid and we're out of communication with an entire
solar system."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Any update from Starfleet?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Slow to warp three.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Scanners on.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Magnification three on the screen.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",What is that?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",No.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",You'd be able to see stars through a dust cloud.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Looks like a
hole in space."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Readings, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Hold present course.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Slow to warp one.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Chekov, prepare to launch a telemetry probe into that
zone."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Direct computer feed to Mister Spock.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Launch probe.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",What was that?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Speculation, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",What is it?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Uhura almost did.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",She says she's all right.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Do you want to see
her?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",What's wrong?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Can you handle it, Bones?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Good.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Kirk out.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Hold our position, Mister Kyle."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Spock, give me an update on the dark area ahead."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","No speculation, no information, nothing."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I've asked you three
times for information on that, and you've been unable to supply it."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Insufficient data is not sufficient, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","You're the science
officer."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",You're supposed to have sufficient data all the time.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I don't know about you but I'm tired.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","If you can't tell me what
it is, let's use reverse logic."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Perhaps it'll help if you tell me what
it isn't."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",So far that's not much help.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Is it possible that this is what killed that solar system and the
Intrepid?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Lieutenant.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Notify the Starfleet that we're going to attempt to probe the
area of darkness to gain further information."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I'm all right.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Distance from zone of darkness, Mister Kyle?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Ahead slow.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Impulse power only.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Very good.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Time, Mister Chekov?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Red Alert.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Deflectors full power.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Phaser banks ready.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Spock!
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Malfunction, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Then kindly tell me what happened to the stars.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Kirk to McCoy.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Things any better down there?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Have you got anything that will help up here?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I don't want
anybody folding on the bridge at a critical moment."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Kirk to Engineering.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Scotty, there was a power loss."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",How come?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Can you compensate for the loss?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I am asking how, mister."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I want answers.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Kirk
out."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",What's that?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Bones, how bad is it?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Why?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",How?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Do you have any answers?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",This ship is in trouble.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We'd better start solving problems
faster than we pick up new ones."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We seem to be in the middle of a
creeping paralysis."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Spock, analysis of that last burst of noise
before we started losing power."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",What boundary layer?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Boundary layer between what and what?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Are you trying to be funny, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Do you have any ideas, Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Recommendations.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",This is the Captain.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We're on a difficult mission, but it's not
the first time."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Our orders do not say stay alive or retreat.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Our mission is to investigate.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We're sick, and we're getting sicker."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We have no guarantees, but we have a good
ship and the best crew in Starfleet."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",So do your jobs.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Carry on.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Kirk
out."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Go ahead, Bones."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Yes, say it, Bones."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Are you all right?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",What was that?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Reverse?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",But that was a forward lurch.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","How could that happen in
reverse thrust?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","By what, Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",He just gave us reverse power.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We lurched
forward."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","What do you think, Scotty?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Forward thrust?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Yes, doesn't it?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Well, if it doesn't work, I'll never let Spock
live it down."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Notch it into forward.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Go ahead.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Have one of your engineers monitor the instruments.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Keep applying
thrust against the pull."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Engineering.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Spock.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The same thing, not the zone itself?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Maybe it's a shield of some kind.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Some form of protection for
something else."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We'll find out what it is, but we'd better get out of here
ourselves."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Scotty, channel all the impulse and warp power into one
massive thrust forward."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",That might snap us out of the zone.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Use whatever power is necessary to get us out of here, Scotty."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Report to your stations, continue your research."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Dismissed.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Well, they may not have done all of these things."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","You just
pointed out how illogical this situation is."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Explain.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",What was it you sensed?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",And what do you think they felt?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","What is it, Scotty?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Do we have the power to pull it off, Scotty?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Stand by.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","All hands, this is the captain."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We are slowly being
pulled deeper into the zone of darkness by an unknown force."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We're
going to apply"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",All available power
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Into one giant forward thrust
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","In the hope that it will yank us out of the
zone."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Prepare yourselves.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","All right, Scotty."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Let's get on with it.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Scotty!
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Are we still losing power?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",How long will the power hold out?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Maintain thrust, Scotty."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","While we're
maintaining our distance, Mister Spock, have you ascertained yet what
we're maintaining our distance from?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Prepare to launch a probe, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Launch probe.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Are we still in contact with the probe?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Magnification four.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Yes, I remember my basic biology, Doctor."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","You mean to tell me
that that thing is a giant single-celled animal?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",The Intrepid died of that particular virus.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","How is it we
survived?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",What about this zone of darkness?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Does the organism generate it
itself as a form of protection?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The closer we get, the faster our energy drains out."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We're barely
surviving at this distance."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I'm not sending anyone anywhere.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Unmanned probes can give us the
information we need to destroy this thing, if it can be destroyed."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",DO you know what the odds are in coming back?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I can't order a man
to do that."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",It's a suicide mission.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Gentlemen, I am not taking volunteers."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I'm better qualified as a command pilot than you are.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Gentlemen, I'll decide."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Captain's personal log, stardate 4309.2."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We
have established that the thing which destroyed the USS Intrepid and
the Gamma Seven=A system is an incredibly huge but simple cellular
being whose energies are totally destructive to all known life."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Both
Mister Spock and Doctor McCoy have volunteered to go in a specially
equipped shuttlecraft to penetrate the cell, find a way to destroy it,
and free the ship."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Doctor McCoy has the medical-biological knowledge.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Spock is better suited physically and emotionally to stand the
stress."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Both are right, both are capable, and which of my friends do I
condemn to death?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",This is the captain.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy,
report to my quarters immediately."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Kirk out.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Very well.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Prepare the shuttlecraft for launching.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Doctor McCoy will tell you what special equipment to put in.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Kirk
out."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I'm sorry, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Not you, Bones."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I'm sorry, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","You're best qualified to
go."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Launch shuttlecraft.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Lieutenant Uhura, channel automatic telemetry directly to the
computers."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Come in, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Chekov.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Spock.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",When do you estimate penetration?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Report, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Spock, report."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Spock, save your power for the shields."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",You mean there'll be two of those things?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Spock, do you read me?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Spock, do you read me?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Spock, come in."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Come in.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",He's alive!
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",He's kicked it in the side to let us know.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Chekov, telemetry analysis as it comes in."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","If the energy of that organism only doubles, we're dead, and
everything within a light year will be defenceless."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Spock understood when he transmitted the co-ordinates of the
chromosomes."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We must destroy that organism.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",How much time do we have?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Put all secondary systems on standby.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Shield power has
unconditional priority."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Put it on, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",What's on your mind?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","He knew the odds when he went out there, just as you did when you
volunteered to go."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","What is that thing out there, Bones?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It's not
intelligent."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Not yet.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Yes, it is, isn't it?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",How many cells does the human body have?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","This thing, this cell, this virus."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It's eleven thousand miles
long, and it's one cell."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","When it grows into millions, we'll be the
virus invading its body."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Antibodies.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Antibodies.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",(goes to desk monitor) Bridge.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Scotty, how much power do we have left?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","What would happen if you diverted all remaining power to the
shields, except for impulse power, keep that in reserve?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Exactly.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Prepare to divert power on my
signal."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Kirk out.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Have you got something to say?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I don't have a few minutes, Bones."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Maybe none of us do.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Let's go.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","All hands, this is the captain."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We're going
to enter the body of the organism rather abruptly, I would think."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Damage control parties stand by.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",All decks secure for collision.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Kirk
out."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Ready, Scotty."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I believe everybody is aware of that, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Very good, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Do we have impulse power, Scotty?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We are committed.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",That thing would probably like phasers.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",It eats power.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Spock was trying to tell us what to do when we lost voice
contact."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Anti-power.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",This thing has a negative energy charge.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Everything seems to work
in reverse."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We'll use anti-matter.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Chekov, prepare a probe."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Scotty, we'll need a magnetic
bottle for the charge."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",How soon?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Chekov, we'll use a timing detonator for the probe."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Work
out a setting."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Helmsman, when do you estimate arrival at nucleus?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Point blank range.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We'll implant it then back away.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","With the eddies and currents in that protoplasm, the probe could
drift thousands of kilometres."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We must be exactly on target, because we
won't have a second chance."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Bones, time for another stimulant."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Keep me together for another seven minutes.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",That's all I need.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","(also making a log entry) We have arrived at
the chromosome body in the nucleus of the organism."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","If we should fail
in our attempt to destroy it, or be unable to free ourselves, I wish to
record my recommendations for the following personnel, that they
receive special citation."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Lieutenant Commander Leonard McCoy,
Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott, officers Chekov, Kyle, Uhura,
and my highest commendation for Commander Spock, Science Officer, who
gave his life in the performance of his duty."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Scott, how much time do we have left at one hundred
percent impulse power?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Kyle, programme fuse for seven minute delay."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","All
non-essential systems on standby."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Communications, scanning, conserve
every bit of power."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We must make it through the membrane before that
thing explodes."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Make it work, Scotty."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Launch probe at zero acceleration.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Forward thrust off, one tenth
of a second."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Kyle, back us out the way we came in."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Chekov, a
nice, straight line."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Don't waste any time.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Very good.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Lieutenant, get me Spock's voice channel."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Highest possible gain.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Spock, do you read me?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Do you read me, Spock, do you read me?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Come in, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Spock!
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Scotty, get a tractor beam."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Get two tractor beams on
that shuttlecraft."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Time until explosion?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Maintaining tractor beams on shuttlecraft, Mister Scott?"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","You may have just written our epitaph, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Activate main viewing screen.
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",(they see stars.)
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Chekov,
report."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Shuttlecraft?
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Spock, you're alive!"
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Later, later, later."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Bring the shuttlecraft aboard, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Starbase Six."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Ahead warp
factor five."
KIRK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I'm still looking forward to a nice period of rest and
relaxation on some lovely (gazes at yeoman) planet."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Captain.
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome",There was a message from Starbase Six.
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Heavy
interference."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","All I get is Intrepid and what sounded like a sector
co-ordinate."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Enterprise calling Starbase Six.
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Enterprise calling Starbase
Six."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Come in.
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Come in.
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Captain, I have Starbase Six readable now."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Switching to audio,
sir."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I cannot filter out the distortion, sir."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome",It's getting worse.
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Exactly what are we looking for, Mister Spock?"
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The telemetry probe, sir."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome",There's no signal from it.
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I'm just dizzy.
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I'll be all right.
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I'm fine, sir."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Yes, sir."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Transmission to Starfleet complete, sir."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It's not coming from communications, sir."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Contact lost, sir."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Captain, I'm getting telemetry."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Captain, I'm receiving a message from Mister Spock on a
low-energy channel."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It's faint, but it is readable."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","On audio, sir."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Damage control parties report minimal damage, sir."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Repairs are
being initiated."
UHURA,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Go ahead, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Interesting.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",No indications of magnetic storms in this sector.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Captain, the Intrepid."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",It just died.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","And the four hundred
Vulcans aboard, all dead."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Doctor, I know what I know."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Captain.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Yes, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I assure you, Doctor, I am quite all right."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The pain was
momentary."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",It passed quickly.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I sensed it die.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Doctor, even I, a half-Vulcan, could hear the death scream of
four hundred Vulcan minds crying out over the distance between us."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Call it a deep understanding of the way things happen to
Vulcans, but I know not a person, not even the computers on board the
Intrepid, knew what was killing them or would have understood it had
they known."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I've noticed that about your people, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","You find it easier
to understand the death of one than the death of a million."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","You speak
about the objective hardness of the Vulcan heart, yet how little room
there seems to be in yours."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",It might have rendered your history a bit less bloody.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Indications of energy turbulence ahead.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Unable to analyse.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I've
never encountered readings like this before."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I would assume that.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Not very likely, Ensign."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Still not able to analyse, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Sensors are feeding data to
the computers now."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Whatever this dark zone is, it lies directly in line
with the course I calculate for the Intrepid and the Gamma Seven-A
system."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I have none, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Insufficient data.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Lieutenant.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",No analysis due to insufficient information.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I am well aware of that, Captain, but the computers contain
nothing on this phenomenon."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It is beyond our experience, and the new
information is not yet significant."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It is not liquid, gaseous, or solid, despite the fact we cannot
see through it."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It is not a galactic nebula such as the Coal Sack, and since our
deflectors were activated by it, it would seem to be some form of
energy, but nothing our sensors can identify."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Very possible.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Captain?
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Analysing now, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",All systems functioning properly.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Unknown, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","That sound was turbulence caused by the penetration of a
boundary layer, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Unknown.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Between where we were and where we are.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It would never occur to me, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We still have no specifics, but we seem to have entered a zone
of energy which is incompatible with our living and mechanical
processes."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","As we draw closer to the source, it grows stronger and we
grow weaker."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Bridge to Captain Kirk.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Sir, we are accelerating."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We are being
pulled toward the centre of the zone of darkness."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Unknown, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I suggest you order Mister Scott to give us
reverse power."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","In that case, Captain, I would suggest we
apply forward thrust."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It's logical to assume that something within this zone absorbs
all forms of energy whether mechanically or biologically produced."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Whatever it is, it would seem to be the same thing which drew all the
energy out of an entire solar system
and the Intrepid."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I would say not, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The analysis of the zone indicates it
is a negative energy field, however illogical that may sound, but it is
not the source of the power drain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I submit, Mister Scott, if we do not get out, the shields would
be extraneous."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It would only prolong our wait for death by a short
period of time."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Captain, the Intrepid would have done all these things too, and
yet they were destroyed."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",True.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",It is also true they never knew what was killing them.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Their logic would not have permitted them to believe they were being
killed."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Vulcan has not been conquered within its collective memory.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The
memory goes back so far that no Vulcan can conceive of a conqueror."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I
knew the ship was lost because I sensed it."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",The touch of death.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Astonishment.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I cannot say what it is, Captain, but I would say it has found
us."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Getting very confused readings, Captain, but this is definitely
the source of the energy drain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Probe will impact in seven point three seconds.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Readings coming in now, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Length, approximately eleven
thousand miles."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Width varying from two thousand to three thousand
miles."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Outer layer studded with space debris and waste.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Interior
consists of protoplasm, varying from a firmer gelatinous layer to a
semi-fluid central mass."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Condition, living."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","That is what is drawing us toward it, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The same way it
drew the Intrepid to her death."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Energy itself, perhaps, drained from us."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I would speculate that
this unknown life form is invading our galaxy like a virus."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The Intrepid must have come across the organism while it was
still low in energy, still hungry."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We are not safe, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We merely
have a little more time than the Intrepid did."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I must differ with you, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We have sent unmanned probes
into it."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","They have given us some information but they have not told us
what we need to know, and we cannot afford the power to take blind
shots at it, hoping to kill it."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",The thing evidently has reflexes.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The unmanned probe we sent in
must have stung it when it entered."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The lurch we felt was the
turbulence of its reaction."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","You have a martyr complex, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I submit that it disqualifies
you."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",The Vulcans saw it first and died.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I am more capable.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Which makes you indispensable, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Further, you are not a
science specialist."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We don't have one day, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We have precisely one hour and
thirty five minutes of power left."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Captain, I"
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Do not suffer so, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","This is not the
first time superior capability has proven more valuable than
professional credentials."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I am familiar with the equipment, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We're wasting time.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",The shuttlecraft is ready.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","This is not a competition, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Whether you understand it or
not, grant me my own kind of dignity."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Then employ one of your own superstitions.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Wish me luck.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Shuttlecraft to Enterprise.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Power drain is enormous and growing worse.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Diverting all secondary power to the shields.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","(McCoy
enters) I'll continue communications as long as there is power to
transmit."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I heard, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We discussed that possibility earlier.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","But
you will need this information."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Slowing now.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Contact in eighteen point three seconds.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Brace
yourselves."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",The area of penetration will no doubt be sensitive.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Contact
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",In six seconds.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I am undamaged, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Relay to Mister Scott I had three
percent power reserve before the shields stabilised."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",There was nothing to spare.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I shall continue
my tests."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Oh, and Doctor McCoy."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",You would have not survived it.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I am moving slowly now, establishing course
toward what appears to be the nucleus."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Calculations indicate the shields will last only forty seven
minutes."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","However, I am able to identify the
chromosome structure."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Changes indicate the organism has stored
sufficient energy for reproductive process to commence."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I'm having difficulty maintaining ship control.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I'm losing voice contact I will transmit internal
co-ordinates of chromosome bodies."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",This is Spock.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I am slowly losing life support and minimal
shield energies."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",According to my calculations
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","(Barely audible over static) The
nervous energy of the organism is maximal just within its outer
protective membrane."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Relatively insensitive to interior irritation.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I
believe sufficient charge of (inaudible) could destroy the organism."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Tell Doctor McCoy he should have wished me luck.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Personal log, Commander Spock, USS
Enterprise."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I have noted the passage of the Enterprise on its way to
whatever awaits it."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","If this record should survive me, I wish it known that I bequeath my
highest commendation and testimonial to the captain,
officers, and crew of the Enterprise."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",The finest starship in the fleet.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Captain, I recommend you abandon the attempt."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Do not risk the ship further on my behalf.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Why, thank you, Captain McCoy."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Shuttlecraft to Enterprise.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Shuttlecraft to
Enterprise."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Request permission to come aboard.
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Obviously, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Immunity Syndrome","And I have some
fascinating data on the organism."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The Intrepid is manned by Vulcans, isn't it?"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","What is it, Spock?"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Are you in pain?
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Come on, Spock, let's go down to Sickbay."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","All of my instruments seem to agree with you if I can trust
these crazy Vulcan readings."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Spock, how can you be so sure the lntrepid
was destroyed?"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","But I thought you had to be in physical contact with a subject
before"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Not even a Vulcan could feel a starship die.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",But four hundred Vulcans?
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Suffer the death of thy neighbour, eh, Spock?"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","You wouldn't wish
that on us, would you?"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Sickbay to Captain Kirk.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",McCoy here.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I'm getting reports from every deck.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Half the people on
this ship just fainted."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Not unless she's feeling ill.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I've got an emergency here.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",There's nothing organic.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","They all seem to be nervous, weak, and
irritable."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","They say it happened suddenly, like a balloon popping."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I'm giving them stimulants to keep them on their feet.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Yeah, we can handle it, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",McCoy here.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Worse.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",They're backed up into the corridor.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",On my way.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",McCoy out.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",A stimulant.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Two thirds of the personnel are affected.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",No.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",You know you'll get everything I can tell you.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","But when
there is nothing, what should I say?"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Nurse.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I have one.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I recommend survival.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Let's get out of here.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Sickbay to Captain Kirk.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Jim, according to the life indicators, the energy levels"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","According to the life monitors, we're dying."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We're all dying.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Stimulants.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I don't know how long we can keep this up.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",But at a dangerously low level.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Well, we're still alive."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I
suppose that's something."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","All I can contribute is the further we
travel into this zone of darkness, the weaker our life functions
become, and I have no idea why."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I'm all right.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",It's those stimulants.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",They catch up with you.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",That is an amoeba.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Yes, for lack of a better term."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",It's a very simple form of life.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","In fact it's a much simpler form of life than what you're looking at
now."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","But that thing can apparently perform all the functions that
qualify it as a living organism."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It can reproduce, it can breathe, it
can eat, although I don't know what."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",It's one of the things we've got to find out.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We've got to take
a closer look at it."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Perhaps we could risk the shuttlecraft.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Perhaps with a
protective shield"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We could send one man in, pinpoint its vulnerable spots."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Who said anything about an order, Jim?"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",You've got a volunteer.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I've done the preliminary work.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","All right, so I'd know enough to go slow when we penetrated its

MCCOY,"The

since"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Just because the Vulcans failed
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",You don't think you're going?
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Jim, that organism contains chemical processes we've never seen
before and may never see again."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We could learn more in one day
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Jim
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Right.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I'll get a few things I need, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Nothing has been proven yet, Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The DNA code analyser will
give you the fundamental structure of the thing."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","You'll need readings
on three light wavelengths from the enzyme recorder."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","You're determined not to let me share in this, aren't you?"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Vulcan dignity?
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",How can I grant you what I don't understand?
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Good luck, Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",You want to bet?
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Well, all I know is, that soon there'll be two, four, eight, and
more."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The entire anti-life matter that that thing puts out
could someday encompass the entire galaxy."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",How do you feel?
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Spock.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Is it me, Jim?"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Am I so sentimental that I just have to
keep believing that he's still alive in that mass of protoplasm?"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It's a disease, like a virus invading the body of our galaxy."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Millions.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Now, isn't that a thought?"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Here we are, antibodies of our own
galaxy, attacking an invading germ."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It would be ironic indeed if that
were our sole destiny, wouldn't it?"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Technically, no."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Medically, yes."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Between the stimulants and the
pressure, I would suggest you try to stay off your feet for a few
minutes."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We couldn't use it.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We'd cook ourselves along with that mess of
protoplasm out there"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",What?
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",How close are you going to it?
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Why?
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",The probe has a range of
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",How long do you think you can keep taking that stuff?
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It'll blow
you apart."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Despite what Spock said, it's still plenty sensitive."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Spock?
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Shut up, Spock!"
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We're rescuing you.
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Don't be so smart, Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Immunity Syndrome","You botched the
acetylcholine test."
STARBASE,"The

STARBASE,"The

STARBASE,"The
Immunity Syndrome",This is a rescue priority.
STARBASE,"The

contact with solar system Gamma Seven-A, which the Intrepid was
investigating."
STARBASE,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

systems to bare minimum."
CHEKOV,"The
Immunity Syndrome","According to Spock's telemetry information, there are over
forty chromosomes in the nucleus that are ready to come together, ready
to reproduce."
CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The

ruptured the membrane and thrown us clear."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We lost five percent of our energy reserve,
sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Our deflector shields are weakened.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Aye, if we don't lose any more."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Don't ask me how it happened.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Yes.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I'm sorry, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",I'm not sure.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I was trying to recalibrate, and
we went into reverse."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I don't know, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","All I know is that the power levels are down
twelve percent and steadily decreasing."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I've never experienced anything
like it."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I don't know, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",It goes against the rules of logic.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",But
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","That's doing it, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We're slowing down.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","But we're not
stopping."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We're still being dragged forward.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","As to the power levels are concerned, everything is acting
backwards, but the drain is continuing."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","On the static test, I could
only get sixty percent power."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We're still being dragged forward.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",But what?
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Aye, Captain, but I'll reserve some for the shields in case we
don't get out."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",That ought to do it.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Engineering to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Ready to try it when you are, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I hope so, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It's no good, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The best we can do is to maintain thrust
against the pull and hold our position."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","At this rate, plus the drain on all systems, two hours."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Engineering to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",You asked me to keep you informed on the power drain.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","All levels
are down fifty percent now"
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",And still draining.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We can maintain
thrust for another hour and fifteen minutes."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Sir?
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",All systems clear for shuttlecraft launch.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",sir.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Captain, h e won't have enough power to get back out if he
diverts it to his shields."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Captain, the pull from that organism is increasing, and the
power drain from our shields is getting critical."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","No more than an hour now, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Scott here, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We're down to forty three percent, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We're slipping a bit against the pull that beastie's putting on us.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We can't last more than forty five
minutes at this rate of decline."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Less, if I have to apply more thrust."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Cut the engine thrust?
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We'd be sucked into
that thing like being caught in a wind tunnel, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Switching power to shields.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Impulse in reserve.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Cutting thrust
to zero, now!"
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Captain, we've only twenty six percent power reserves after
entry."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I saved all I could, sir, but I don't know whether we have
enough to get back out again."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Or time either.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Aye, we are, but we're committed to what?"
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We have no power for
the phasers."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Then what the devil, begging your pardon sir, are we doing?"
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",We can't use the power to destroy it.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Aye, it couldn't swallow that."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","It's on its way, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Six, maybe seven minutes, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Captain, we don't have enough time to do it."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","We only have a
fifty three second escape margin."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome",Tractor beams on.
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I can't guarantee it'll hold when the warhead
explodes."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","The power levels are (looks at readout) The power levels are
dead, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Power's coming back, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","I don't know how, sir, but it's still with us."
SCOTT,"The
Immunity Syndrome","Aye, sir."
CHAPEL,"The

CHEKOV,A Piece Of The Action,"Approaching Sigma Iotia Two, Captain."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Standard orbit, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Boss?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"All right, Lieutenant, put him on."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Oxmyx.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the Federation of Planets."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Yes.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Unfortunately, the Horizon was lost with all hands shortly after leaving your planet."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,We only received her radio report last month.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Difficult to explain.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,We received a report a hundred years late because it was sent by conventional radio.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Your system is on the outer reaches of the galaxy.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,They didn't have subspace communication in those days.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I'll explain it in more detail when I see him.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"The ship won't land, but we'll transport several people down."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, that's a little difficult for you to understand, too."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I'll explain it in more detail when I see you.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Where will be convenient?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Scotty, do you have the co-ordinates?"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Good.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I'll be looking forward to it.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Kirk out.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Scotty, you have the conn."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Spock, McCoy, we're beaming down."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Standard equipment.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,The Horizon's contact came before the Non-Interference Directive went into effect.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,We don't know there is contamination.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,The evidence is only circumstantial.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,The beginnings of industrialisation.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Let's not argue about it.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Let's go study it.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Energise.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Home was never like this.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I've seen pictures of the old days that look like this.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,That's a weapon.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Be careful with that.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Look, we were asked to come down here by Mister Oxmyx."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,He said
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Is this how you greet all your guests?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Yes, but the Horizon crew wasn't composed of cold-blooded killers."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"They didn't report this culture in this state, either."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,What happened?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Is this the way your citizens do business, their right of petition?"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Depends.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"No, thank you."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You're Mister Oxmyx.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"They call you The Boss, Mister Oxmyx."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,The boss of what?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You're the government here?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"But there are other bosses, other territories?"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I know it's a book.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Did they leave any other books?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,What is it you want?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Now let me get this straight.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You want us to supply you with arms and assistance so you can carry out an aggression against your neighbours?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Mister Oxmyx, my orders are quite explicit."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Under no circum
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Don't do that.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You could knock out the side of the building.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Out of the question.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Hold it.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,It's a communication device.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,It's locked onto my ship's systems.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"In old Chicago, conventional government almost broke down."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,The gangs nearly took over.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"If this society broke down as the result of the Horizon's influence, then the Federation's responsible, and we've got to do something to straighten this mess out."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Spock, if you could get to the sociological computer, do you think you could find a solution?"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, I've got an idea about that."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,(goes over to the card table and gets guns pointed at him) Gentlemen.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Gentlemen.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"This, card game is a kid's game."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Oh, yes, yes."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I wouldn't waste my time.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"On Beta Antares Four, they play a real game."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"It's a man's game, but of course it's probably a little beyond you."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,It requires intelligence.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Spock.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Spock.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"(sits) Of course, the cards on Beta Antares Four are different, but not too different."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,The name of the game is called fizzbin.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Fizzbin.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,It's not too difficult.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"(begins dealing) Each player gets six cards, except for the player on the dealer's right, who gets seven."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Yes.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"The second card is turned up, except on Tuesdays."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Oh, look what you got, two jacks."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You got a half fizzbin already.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"No, no."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"If you got another jack, why, you'd have a sralk."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Yes.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You'd be disqualified.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"You need a king and a deuce, except at night of course, when you'd need a queen and a four."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Right.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Oh, look at that."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You've got another jack.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,How lucky you are!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,How wonderful for you.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"If you didn't get another jack, if you'd gotten a king, why then you'd get another card, except when it's dark, you'd give it back."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Yes, but what you're after is a royal fizzbin, but the odds in getting a royal fizzbin are astron."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Spock, what are the odds in getting a royal fizzbin?"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, they're astronomical, believe me."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Now, for the last card."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,We'll call it a kronk.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You got that?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Spock, find the radio station."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Uhura's monitoring the broadcasts.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Cut in and have yourselves beamed up to the ship.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"I will, but I'm bringing Bela Oxmyx with me."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Bones, this mess is our responsibility."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You have your orders.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Let's go.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"If you don't mind, I'd rather walk."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I'm beginning to get the idea.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,And you?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Would you mind telling me how you even know who I am?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You want to make a deal.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Let me guess.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"You want, you'll want heaters, and then you'll want troops to teach them how to use them."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,And then you'll attack the other bosses and take over the whole planet.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Then we'll sit down and talk, right?"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I got a better idea.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,This planet has to be united.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You know that.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Bela knows that.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Let's sit down.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"You, me, Bela."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Discuss this whole matter, contact the other bosses, and talk about it like reasonable men."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"No, I don't think you're stupid."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I just think your behaviour is arrested.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"I'm sorry, Krako."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,No deal.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Help me!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Help!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Help me!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Drop the guns.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Drop 'em.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,(McCoy and Spock take back their phasers) Move down there.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"I thought you were supposed to report to the ship, Mister Spock."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,It may be just as well.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Did you find out anything from the computer?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Then you don't mind if I play a hunch?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, now that we have Bela, I'm going to put the bag on Krako."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"(grabs the guy in a blue suit) Listen, you."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Say, that's nice material."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I said.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You too!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Get out of the clothes.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Nobody's going to put the bag on me any more.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Wheels, Mister Spock."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Key in the ignition.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Turn the ignition on.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,And nothing happens.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Where's the starter?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,There's the starter.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Yes!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,(pushing the gear lever and making grinding noises) Oops!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Gears.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,(puts it quietly into gear) I kind of like this.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I'm going to get one myself.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,It was that bad?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Now, that could be a bit of a problem."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"If they were inside, where they couldn't be seen, we could stun them with our phasers, but not out here."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,They don't look like the trusting type.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Young man, run along and play."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Hold on, Spock."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Out of the mouths of babes
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I'm calling you a babe.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Yeah I'm calling you a babe, but there's nothing personal in it."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Sit down.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,(on the car bumper) You know a way we can get close to them?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,How?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,What do you want?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"All right, young man."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,We'll guarantee you a piece of the action if we can pull this thing off.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Done.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,(they shake on it) What do we do?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,That's it.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Let's go.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Sonny!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Sonny!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Wait a moment.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,What have they done?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,What have they done to you?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,What have you done?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,A piece of the action.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,No one can see.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Put your phaser on stun.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"I think you've got it reversed, Mister Krako."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,The sound of a machine gun bolt being pulled back.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,(there are two more guards behind them.)
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,(JoJo is shaking a phaser to make it work.)
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Mister Krako, I don't, er"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"I'm trying to tell you, Mister Krako, that this is bigger than you, Oxmyx or anyone."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Can you trust all your men?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, one of these can make a man a pretty big boss, you know."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"All right, Krako, we don't have time to show you how to play with toys!"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,(takes the phaser back)
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"What do you think we're here for, to get a cut of your deal?"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Forget it.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,That's peanuts to an outfit like the Federation.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Right?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Right?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Now look, Krako, we're taking over the whole ball of wax."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You co-operate with us and maybe we'll cut you in for a piece of the action.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"That's, er."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,We'll figure it out later.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Who's interfering?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,We're taking over.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Check?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"The planet is being taken over by the Federation, but we don't want to come in here and use our muscle, you know what I mean?"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,That ain't subtle.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,So what we do is we help one guy take over the planet.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"He pulls the strings, and then we pull his."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"(to Spock) Hey, you, sit down."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,What do you care as long as you're being cut in?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Course, there's always Bela Oxmyx."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"All right, Scotty."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,We made a deal with Krako.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Yeah.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,We're ready to make the hit.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,We're taking over the whole planet as soon as you get ready.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Sure.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"We can trust Krako, but we don't have any choice."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You know what I mean?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"He's standing about twelve feet in front of me, all ready to be our pal."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Of course, Scotty, I'd like to show him the ship, just to show him that we're, er, we're on the level."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,But you know how it is.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Scotty, we'll need phasers to equip every one of Krako's men."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,We'll need advisors and troops to back him up on the hit.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"You got all that, Scotty?"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"You may begin, Mister Scott."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Not exactly.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Right?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,It's faster than walking.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Are you afraid of cars?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Spock, I've got the hang of it."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Now go on.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Wrong again, Oxmyx."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Knock it off, Sawbones."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I want to talk to this creep.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Now listen, I'm getting tired of playing pattycake with you penny-ante operators."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You're a penny-ante operator.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Sit down.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"All right, Spocko, cover him."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Now listen, sweetheart."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"The Federation's moving in, taking over."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"You play ball, we'll cut you in."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"You don't, you're out."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,All the way out.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You know what I mean?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You got Krako on ice?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Okay, baby."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Cool him till I flag you.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Keep him until I send for him.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,We're going to make some old-style phone calls from this locale.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,So you locate the man on the other end of the blower and give him a ride to this flop.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Find the man at the other end of the phone
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,And transport him to these co-ordinates.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Can do, sweetheart?"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Now you.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Get on the blower and call the other bosses.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Get with it.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I'm giving the orders here.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Scotty?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Lock in and energise.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Yeah.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,All right!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,All right!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,All right!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,All right!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Now the Federation's taking over whether you like it or not.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"You people, you've been running this planet like a piecework factory."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"From now on, it's going to be under one roof."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You're going to run it like a business.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,That means you're going to make a profit.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I'm cutting the Federation in for forty percent.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You got any objections?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Hang on a minute.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Hang on a minute.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Quiet!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Just a moment!
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,There are over four hundred guys there.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Now, wait a minute."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Wait a minute.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Get that heater down.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Don't you want to take a look at what you're going to fight?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"All right, but at least let me call my ship one last time and say goodbye."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Hello, Scotty."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,This is Kirk.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Scotty, put the ship's phasers on stun."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Fire a burst in a one-block radius around these co-ordinates.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"They're not dead, just knocked out for a while."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,But they might just as well have been that way if we wanted them to.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I was talking about both.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, Bela, no, no, no."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,The Federation can't get connected with a small-time operation like this.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"No, I was thinking, Bela, you would be the top boss."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Krako, you'd be his lieutenant."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"The rest of you, I don't want any trouble from the rest of you because you'll have to answer to the Federation."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,We'll be back every year to collect our cut.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Yeah, I think forty percent's sufficient."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"It's reasonable, Mister Oxmyx."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Let's break out some of your drinking stuff and celebrate the syndicate.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Gentlemen, you two have been brooding ever since we returned to the ship."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Brooding, Mister Spock."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"A sombre, emotional state."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Now, do you wish to continue it or are you going to discuss it?"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Ah, yes."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I understand that.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You don't think it's logical to leave a criminal organisation in charge.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Yes, that's a very good question, Mister Spock."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,I propose our cut be put into the planetary treasury and used to guide the Iotians into a more ethical system.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Despite themselves, they'll be forced to accept conventional responsibilities."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Isn't that logical?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"All right, Bones, in the language of the planet, what's your beef?"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Go ahead.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Tell me.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You left it?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,You're not certain of what?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,In Bela's office?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"They will, they will."
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,And they'll find out how the transtator works.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Everything.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,Serious?
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Serious, Bones?"
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,It upsets the whole percentage.
KIRK,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, in a few years, the Iotians may demand a piece of our action."
UHURA,A Piece Of The Action,"Captain, I have received vocal contact from an official station."
UHURA,A Piece Of The Action,They relayed us to a man named Oxmyx.
UHURA,A Piece Of The Action,His title is Boss.
UHURA,A Piece Of The Action,"Lieutenant Uhura here, Mister Spock."
UHURA,A Piece Of The Action,"Mister Spock, what are you doing on this frequency?"
UHURA,A Piece Of The Action,"Mister Spock, Mister Oxmyx is making contact from the surface."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Hello, Captain."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,You're from the same outfit as the Horizon?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Last month?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,What are you talking about?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,The Horizon left here a hundred years ago.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Toward the edge of what?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, there's an intersection just at the end of the block, near a yellow fire plug."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Think you can find it?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Fine.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Fine.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,I'll have a reception committee there to meet you.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,(a silver haired man in a suit) Hit that button.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,(the girl sitting on his desk obeys) Yeah?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,All right.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Bring them in.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,(he goes to the pool table and picks up a cue) Which one of you is the captain?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Make yourself a drink, Captain."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,It's good stuff.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,I distill it myself.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"That's me, pal."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Doctor, huh?"
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Put that chopper down, Kalo."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,These guys are our guests.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Pick up a cue, Captain."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Go ahead.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,You can't be too careful around here these days.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,The boss of my territory.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,I got the biggest in the world.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"You know, there's one thing wrong with having the biggest."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,There's always some punk trying to cut you out.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,That's why you can't be too careful.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,What government?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Look, I told you."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,I got the territory and I run it.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,That's all.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Yeah, sure."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Maybe a dozen or so, not counting the small fry, but then they get burned anyway soon as I get around to it."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,How do you know about Krako?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Okay.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"You hit him back, you hear?"
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Hard.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, wait a minute."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,That's the Book.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,The Book.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"They left it, the other ship."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,The Horizon.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,I don't want any more cracks about the Book.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Sure.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Some text books on how to make radio sets and stuff like that, but, look, I brought you here so you could help me, not for you to ask me questions."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"After that, I'll answer anything you want to know."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, I was thinking."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,You Feds must have made a lot of improvements since that other ship came here.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,You probably got all kinds of fancy heaters up there.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,So here's the deal.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,You give me all the heaters I need.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Enough tools so I can knock off those punks all at once.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Then I'll take over, and all you'll have to do is deal with me."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,What aggression?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,I got to make hits.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,I want you to help me hit them.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,That's all.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,I ain't interested in your orders.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"From now on, you're gonna take orders from me."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,I'm gonna give you just eight hours to give me the things I want.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"If I don't have those tools by then, I'm gonna call up your ship and have them pick you up in a box."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Is that understood, pal?"
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Let's see how this thing works.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"That good, huh?"
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,All you have to do is give me about a hundred of these fancy heaters and we'll have no more trouble.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Captain Kirk, I usually get what I want."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,What's this thing?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,(silence) All right.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Burn him.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,How does it work?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Kalo, take them to the warehouse and put them in a bag."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Keep a sharp eye on them, you hear."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"(into communicator) Hey, you."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,In the ship up there.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, you in the ship."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,This is Bela Oxmyx.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,I got your captain and his friends down here.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,You want to see them alive
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Again you'll send me down a hundred of these fancy heaters you've got, and some troops to show me how to use them."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"You heard right, pal."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"I'm going to give you just eight hours to get me the goods I want, or I put the hit on your friends."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,You understand?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Huh?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, how'd you get back up there?"
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Oh, yeah."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"I tell you, you'd better come on back down."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Krako's put the bag on your captain.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Kidnapped him, you dope."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"He'll scrag him, too."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Look, you guys got something I want."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,I can help you get your captain back.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Then we can talk about the deal I want.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,What's to trust?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Business is business.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,We'll call a truce.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,You come on down.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"My boys'll spring Kirk, and then we'll talk about giving me a hand."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"I'm a businessman, pally."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,What do ya say?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,You know what to do.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Just the same, you be careful."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,They'll have heaters on them.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,(to his girl) Now you watch this.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"(taking the phasers) Pick up many more of these, I won't need your co-operation."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"I was hoping you'd think that, dummy."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Nobody helps nobody but himself.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Huh?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Yeah, but I got to be the unity."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,The most co-operative man in this world is a dead man.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"And if you don't keep your mouth shut, you're going to be co-operatin'."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, Captain, you got away from Krako."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"You know, that ain't easy."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Knowing Krako, he'll probably send them back on a blotter."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"What do you mean, penny-ante operator?"
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Yeah, sure."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Why didn't you say so in the first place?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,All you had to do was explain it to me.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,I sure don't know what you think you're talking about.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Hello.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Hello?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Guess who?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Yeah, you bet your life I've got a lot of nerve."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,What are you going to do about it?
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, Captain, that ain't bad."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Wait a minute.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Wait a minute.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Tepo's got a point.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,All we ever seen is them.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,My boys will put you down.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, that's great, Krako."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Now we got hostages again.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,We can make a deal with the Feds up there.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, did you see that?"
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Okay, okay, Kirk, so we get the message."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"Now, what was this syndicate deal you were talking about?"
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,Okay.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,A syndicate makes sense to me.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"I'm a peaceful man at heart, but I'm sick and tired of all these hits."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,"I hit Krako, Krako hits Tepo, Tepo hits me."
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,There's too many bosses.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,We can't get anything done.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,It's reasonable.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,It sounds reasonable.
OXMYX,A Piece Of The Action,That sound reasonable to you?
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"Located, sir."
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Scott here.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Who's this?
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Am I to understand that you're holding the captain and his party?
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,I don't know.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"(Oxmyx ends the transmission, laughing) Lieutenant Hadley, check the language banks and find out what a heater is."
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Enterprise.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Scott here.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"We did, sir?"
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"Do you think that's wise, sir?"
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Aye.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,I know indeed.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Captain.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,We're preparing everything.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,It'll be ready when you give the word.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"Acknowledged, Captain."
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"It looks like we put the bag on you, doesn't it."
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,You've got nothing.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"You mind your place, mister, or you'll be wearing concrete galoshes."
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Er.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Aye.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Enterprise.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"Scott here, sir."
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"Aye, he's here."
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Mad enough
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"To chew neutronium, but behaving himself."
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Flag me?
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,What?
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"Can do, Captain."
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Standing by.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Scott here.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Enterprise.
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"Scott here, sir."
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,"Right away, sir."
SCOTT,A Piece Of The Action,Scott out.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,They must have interfered with the normal evolution of the planet.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,What was the state of the Iotian culture before the Horizon came?
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,So we're going down to recontaminate them.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,This is like coming home.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, those firearms are not necessary."
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,"Who, me?"
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,What?
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, since this Oxmyx asked us down here, don't you think we should see him?"
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,That man's dead back there.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,"This is the contamination you're looking for, Jim."
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,Yes.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,"Judging from what we've seen so far, I agree."
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,"You said they were imitative, and the book"
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,One book on the gangs of Chicago did all this.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,It's amazing.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,It's the Bible.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,"Yeah, well, Oxmyx is the worst gangster of all."
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,"Jim, you can't"
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,You do that very well.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,"Now, how are you with primitive radio equipment?"
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,And very simple.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,Well?
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,You mean you're giving up?
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,You mean you're going to trust him?
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,Now you're beginning to make sense.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,"We're trying to help you, Oxmyx."
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,You admit that?
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,"What are we going to do now, Jim?"
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,Where are they?
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,Jim.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,"I don't know how serious this is, Jim, and I don't quite know how to tell you"
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,But in all the confusion I
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,I think I left it in Bela's office.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,Somewhere.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,I'm not certain.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,I left my communicator.
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,You really think it's that serious?
MCCOY,A Piece Of The Action,How do you mean?
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,It will be interesting to see the results of the contamination.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Horizon reports indicate the Iotians are extremely intelligent and somewhat imitative.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"The damage has been done, Doctor."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,We are here to repair it.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Fascinating.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Interesting, Captain."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Passers-by are carrying, I believe, firearms."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Sir, would you mind explaining that statement, please?"
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Sir, does everyone here carry firearms?"
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Sir, there are several questions I would like to ask."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Does that include, if I may ask, a gentleman called Krako?"
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Captain?
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Gangsters.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Chicago.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Mobs.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Published in 1992.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Where'd you get this?
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"This is the contamination, Captain."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Astonishing.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,An entire culture based on this.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Fascinating, but quite impossible."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,They evidently seized upon that one book as the blueprint for an entire society.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"We may quarrel with Mister Oxmyx' methods, but his goal is essentially the correct one."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,This society must become united or it will degenerate into total anarchy.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Unfortunately, I do not have access to my computers, nor are these gentlemen likely to permit it."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,I'm familiar with the culture on Beta Antares.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,There aren't games
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"I have never computed them, Captain."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Surely, you're coming, Captain."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Very simple.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Amplitude modulation transmission.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"I simply adjust the frequency, throw this switch, and the Enterprise should answer."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Fascinating.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Let me see.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,(throws a few more switches and picks up the microphone.)
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Enterprise, this is Mister Spock."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"A very long and complicated story, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Notify the transporter room, Two to beam up, these co-ordinates."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Futile, Doctor."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,No specifics.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,There is no record of such a culture based on a moral inversion.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"No, Doctor."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"I'm merely saying the computers can offer us no logical, rational, factual way out of our current dilemma."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"On audio, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Mister Oxmyx, this is Mister Spock."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Irrelevant, since we are here."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Why would he put a bag on our captain?
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"If I understand you correctly, that would seem to be a problem."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"I'm afraid I find it difficult to trust you, Mister Oxmyx."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,You'll show no further hostility?
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Since we must have our captain back, I accept."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,We shall arrive in your office within ten minutes.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Spock out.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"If we are to save the captain without blatant, forceful interference on this planet, Doctor, we must have the assistance of someone indigenous."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,We are therefore forced to trust Mister Oxmyx.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Mister Scott, though we hope to avoid interference, I suggest you set one of our phaser banks on a strong stun position."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"I trust we shall not have to use them, but it is best to be prepared."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Energise.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Mister Oxmyx, I understood we had an arrangement, a truce."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Sir, you are employing a double negative."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,I fail to see why you do not understand us.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,You yourself have stated the need for unity of authority on this planet.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,We agree.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Co-operation, sir, would inevitably result"
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"We did, Captain."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,The situation required our return.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Nothing useful.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Logic and practical information do not seem to apply here.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"To deny the facts would be illogical, Doctor."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"I'm not sanguine about hunches, Captain, but I have no practical alternative."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"A fliwer, Captain."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Interesting.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Yes.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Oh.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,I believe they had a device known as a clutch.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Clutch, Captain."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Perhaps one of those pedals on the floor.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Captain, you are an excellent starship commander, but as a taxi driver you leave much to be desired."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"If we can get close enough to them, we should be able to render them harmless with reasonable rapidity."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,I beg your pardon?
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Young man
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Young man, this is likely to be quite hazardous."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,You do not even know what the action is going to be.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Logical.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Captain, I believe that perhaps it would be wise to do as he says."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,I just heard the sound of
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Unquestionably.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Right.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,A miniscule.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,A very small piece.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Right.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Check.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Must we?
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,But not as safe.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Not at all, Captain."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,It's your driving that alarms me.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"I would advise you to keep dialing, Oxmyx."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Brooding, Captain?"
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Captain, I'm neither brooding nor sombre."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,But I do have reservations about your solution to the problem of the Iotians.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"Highly irregular, to say the least, Captain."
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,I'm also curious as to how you propose to explain to Starfleet Command that a starship will be sent each year to collect our cut.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,Captain.
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,"If the Iotians, who are very bright and imitative people, should take that communicator apart"
SPOCK,A Piece Of The Action,The transtator is the basis for every important piece of equipment that we have.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"(in a brown suit) Okay, you three, let's see you petrify."
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,I want to see you turn to stone.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"Put your hands over your head, or you ain't going to have no head to put your hands over."
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,What's this?
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"A heater, huh?"
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, the boss will love that."
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,(puts it in his pocket)
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"I know what he said, bud."
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,He said some of the boys would meet you.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"Okay, we're meeting you."
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,You trying to make trouble?
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Don't give me those baby blue eyes.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,I don't go for that innocent routine.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,I never heard such stupid questions in my life.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,All right.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Get moving.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Down the street.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Krako's getting more gall all the time .
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"It happens, pal."
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Yeah?
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,We ain't playing for peanuts.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"What's the matter, you guys never saw a hit before?"
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Ask the boss.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,I don't know nothing.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Get moving.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Write him a letter.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"Get lost, will ya?"
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Some people got nothing to do but complain.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,They pay their percentages and the boss takes care of them.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"Got them, Boss."
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,No sweat.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"He hit us, Boss."
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,I'll take care of it.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, Boss, this here's a heater, and I don't know what this is."
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,(tosses them to his leader)
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"In the bag, Boss."
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Come on.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"You think so, huh?"
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Who's asking you?
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"Listen, Kirk, I can play anything you can figure out."
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"Take the cards, big man."
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Show us how it's played.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Fizzbin?
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,On the right.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,On Tuesday.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,I need another jack.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,A sralk?
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Except at night.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,If it were dark on Tuesday.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,What?
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,I'll get it.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,"Don't worry, Boss."
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,They can't do nothing till they're through sparkling.
KALO,A Piece Of The Action,Now just a minute.
WOMAN,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, Kalo."
WOMAN,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, when's the boss going to do something about the crummy street lights around here, eh?"
WOMAN,A Piece Of The Action,A girl ain't safe.
WOMAN,A Piece Of The Action,"Listen, we pay our percentages."
WOMAN,A Piece Of The Action,We're entitled to a little service for our money.
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,Hold it!
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,"Okay, pally, we're going for a ride."
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,"Listen, pally, this could either be a taxi or a hearse."
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,You know what I mean?
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,"Sharp, Boss."
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,"(waking up) Oh, not again."
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,"(rouses the other man) Hey, wake up."
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,You all right?
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,"(opens the door) Hey, you guys."
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,Come in here.
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,The Feds snatched Krako.
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,I never seen anything like it.
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,They're going to move in unless we stop 'em now.
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, Bela's mixed up in this somehow."
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,I've got a sneaking hunch they're going to high-tail it back to his territory.
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,You know what we're going to do?
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,We're going to hit his place.
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,All right.
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,You know what to do.
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,We hit Bela's place and nobody comes out alive.
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,All right.
ZABO,A Piece Of The Action,Let's go.
VOICE,A Piece Of The Action,"That was the Jailbreakers with their latest recording on Request Time, brought to you by Bang-Bang, the makers of the sweetest little automatic in the world"
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"So you're the Fed, huh?"
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, well, well, well, well."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Krako.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,JoJo Krako.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I'm the head of the whole Southside Territory.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, glad to see you."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Sit down, Kirk."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I've got all of Bela's communications bugged.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,He can't make a date with a broad unless I know about it.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, I guess you want to know why I brought you here."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, I like that."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,That is sharp.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"That's sharp, eh, Zabo?"
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"That's right, a deal."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I want you to help me.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Wrong!
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I know Bela.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,He didn't offer you beans.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Now, me, I'm a reasonable man."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"You give me what I want and I'll cut you in for, say, a third."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Skimmed right off the top.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, what do you think?"
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"You watch it, Kirk."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,The Book tells us how to handle things.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,(snaps his fingers to recall the girl) You make hits.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Somebody argues, you lean on 'em."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"What do you think, we're stupid or something?"
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I haven't been arrested in my whole life!
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Listen, pally, I know how to get what I want."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"You want to live, don't you, Kirk?"
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,You bet you do.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"But after I get through with you, you're liable to be sorry unless you come across."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Hold him here.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Tell Cirl the Knife to sharpen up his blade.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I just might have a job for him.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Unless you come across with the heaters.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,That's too bad.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Put him on ice!
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, ain't this nice?"
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"I was wondering how I was going to get you back, and here you deliver yourself!"
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Who's your friend with the ears, Kirk?"
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"I ain't, pally."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Put down your heaters.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"So this is the fancy heater, huh?"
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,How does it work?
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,The only thing I want you to tell me is how it works.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Of course I can!
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"I either trust 'em, or they're dead."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Let's go in here and talk about it.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Now we got no busy little eyes to worry about.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,How does this thing work?
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Toys?
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,How much is that?
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I thought you guys had laws.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,No interference.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,What's your cut?
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"All right, it's a deal."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Call your ship.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Bring down your boys and whatever else you need.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,You mean you're going to start sending down your boys now?
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,How the hell'd I get here?
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,What?
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,What happened?
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,(Scott enters) You.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,You must be that Scott fellow Kirk was talking to.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I want to know what happened.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I got rights.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,You mean cement overshoes?
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Listen.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,They got a ship.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I know.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I was there.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I'm not going to believe my eyes.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Let me say something.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I only saw three guys in that ship.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Maybe there ain't no more.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"That's your story, buster."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Hey, it's my boys."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,They're making a hit at this place.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Want to bet?
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,(gets the gun off McCoy) Keep moving.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"One move out of you two, I'll drill them."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Give me the hardware.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Are you kidding?
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,This one's all mine.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"From now on, nobody's going no place."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I'm going to be the big boss in this here territory.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,I already seen it.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"You're nothing, Fed."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Well, all right."
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Go ahead.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,Don't get smart.
KRAKO,A Piece Of The Action,"Gee, that's some trick."
MAN,A Piece Of The Action,It ought to be.
MAN,A Piece Of The Action,It cost a bundle.
MAN,A Piece Of The Action,Hey!
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,"(runs over to them) It's a hit, ain't it?"
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,You're going to hit somebody.
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,Can I watch?
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,Where'd you get them ears?
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,You going to hit Krako out here?
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,You open up and you'll be scragged from every window in the street.
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,I can fix it for ya.
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,Who you callin' a babe?
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,You calling me a babe?
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,(brandishes his little knife.)
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,Sure.
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,What's in it for me?
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,A piece of the action.
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,I figure it's got to be a thick percentage or you wouldn't be trying to hit Krako.
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,Is that a contract?
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,You'll know what to do.
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,And that!
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,And how do you like that?
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,"Think you can gang up on me, huh?"
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,"What are you, chicken?"
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,"Come on, why don't you gang up on me?"
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,I'll cut off your head and throw it in your face!
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,"Take that, and that, and falls over) Daddy, Daddy, I hurt myself!"
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,I want my daddy!
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,Daddy!
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,I want my daddy!
BOY,A Piece Of The Action,I want my daddy.
GUARD,A Piece Of The Action,What's the matter?
GUARD,A Piece Of The Action,"Did you hurt yourself, kid?"
GUARD,A Piece Of The Action,"Cute kid, ain't he?"
GUARD,A Piece Of The Action,Yeah?
GUARD,A Piece Of The Action,How?
TEPO,A Piece Of The Action,Coming over with my boys and we (realises he's not where he was a second earlier) Mother.
TEPO,A Piece Of The Action,And what's your percentage?
TEPO,A Piece Of The Action,Yeah!
TEPO,A Piece Of The Action,"I hear a lot of talk, but all I see here is you and a couple of your boys."
TEPO,A Piece Of The Action,I don't see no Federation.
TEPO,A Piece Of The Action,"What, a couple of boys?"
TEPO,A Piece Of The Action,He was talking about a percentage.
TEPO,A Piece Of The Action,"Look, you figure maybe forty percent's enough?"
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"No life form readings, Captain."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Continuing scan.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"I am getting readings on small metallic objects, Captain."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,It is possible the ship was destroyed in space and the survivors proceeded here in a shuttle craft.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Confirmed.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Interesting.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,A neural field?
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,What brings you here?
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Why use our vessel?
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Why not transmit a message to your galaxy?
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Fascinating material.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Similar to diburnium, but considerably more dense."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,I doubt even phaser fire could disturb its molecular structure.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"No, Doctor."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,More than that.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,They registered as perfect human life forms.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,I recall noting the readings were almost classic textbook responses.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Most curious.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,The chances are very much against it.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Gentlemen, I'm constrained to point out we do not even know what this projector looks like."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Possible.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,I would have to have one to examine.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Yes, I recall, Captain."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,I led him to believe we had escaped.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,I shall attempt it.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Yes, I will be all right, Captain."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,We must hurry.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Yes, quite all right, Doctor."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"I did not break it, Doctor."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,I was thrown away by something I've never experienced before.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,A series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on my mind and consciousness.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Colours, shapes, mathematical equations fused and blurred."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"I've been attempting to isolate them, but so far I've been able to recall clearly only one."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Immense beings, a hundred limbs which resemble tentacles."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Minds of such control and capacity that each limb is capable of performing a different function.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Undoubtedly.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"I'm dubious of the possibilities of success, Captain."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,The medical equipment is not designed to put out a great deal of power.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,The polarized elements would burn out quickly.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,A small one.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"I assure you, Captain, I am in perfect health."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,We find it more restful to the body than your so-called vacation.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,It will take me a moment to prepare.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"I've located their power source, captain."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,It's installed in Engineering.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Whatever it is we must do, it is impossible."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,This material surrounding the projector is the same as I discovered on the planet.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Readings indicate it is impervious to any of our weapons.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,We cannot penetrate the casing to get to the machine.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"There is one other possibility, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"The final decision, of course, must be the captain's, but I believe we must have it ready for him."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,The Enterprise is propelled by matter-anti-matter reactors.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,The barrier we must traverse is negative energy.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Nor I.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,But it must be made available to the captain.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Impossible, Captain."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,The power source is protected by a material we cannot breach even with our phasers.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Mister Scott and I have prepared the means for the only logical alternative available to us.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,The barrier we must penetrate is composed of negative energy.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"When we engage the barrier, the ship will explode."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,The Kelvans will be stopped here.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Sensors indicate density negative, radiation negative, energy negative."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"(Kirk starts chewing his nails with indecision) All instruments off the dials, Captain."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,We are in contact with the barrier.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Instruments returning to normal, Captain."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Life support systems sustaining on emergency.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"I have reviewed ship's personnel, Captain."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,It appears we four are the only ones the Kelvans consider essential.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Captain?
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Most curious.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,The isolated glimpses of things I saw when I touched Kelinda's mind are beginning to coalesce in my consciousness.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,The Kelvans have superior intellectual capacity.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"To achieve it, they have apparently sacrificed anything which would tend to distract them."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Perceptive senses such as taste, touch, smell, and, of course, emotions."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Yes.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Quite correct, Captain."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,But they have taken human form and are therefore having human reaction.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,That seems reasonable.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Yes.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Humans are very peculiar.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"I often find them unfathomable, but an interesting psychological study."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,I believe you're referring to a kiss.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,But it is my understanding that such apologies are usually exchanged between people who have some affection for each other.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Your game is off.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Are you disturbed by the incident?
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,You've known Kelinda for some time.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,She's a Kelvan as you are.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Among humans, I've found the symptoms you're displaying usually indicate jealousy."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Captain Kirk seems to find her quite attractive.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,You are not jealous?
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Nor upset?
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Checkmate.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Rojan has exhibited symptoms of jealousy.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Doctor, I'm due for another injection of stokaline."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Stokaline.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Automatic sensors and various other recording devices require monitoring and periodic adjustments.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"If you wish, I shall call him to the bridge."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,I left him in the recreation room.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"No, Kelinda was with him."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,She seemed anxious to speak to him.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"It would appear, sir, that you have little control over her."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,Or perhaps Captain Kirk has more.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,"Rojan, you are only a link in a chain, following an order given three hundred years ago."
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,This is an opportunity for you to establish a destiny of your own.
SPOCK,By Any Other Name,A robot ship could be sent to Kelva with the Federation proposal.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"Well, somebody sent a distress call."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"In other words, the galaxy isn't big enough for both of us."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,They registered as human.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,Yes.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"If we could put that out of operation, we might have a chance."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"Spock, are you sure you're all right?"
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,You didn't look very well when you broke that mind touch.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,Do you mean that's what the Kelvans really are?
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"Well, if they look that way normally, why did they adapt themselves to our bodies?"
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"Well, that's enough."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"One wrong move, and they jam all our neural circuits."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,How?
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"It's a good idea, Jim, but anyone looking at him can tell he's healthy."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"Jim, his heartbeat really is slow."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,His pulse is practically non-existent.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,He may die.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"If I can get him up to sickbay, there's a chance he'll live."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,Prepare two ccs of stokaline.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"Don't argue, nurse."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,Just get it.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,(injects Spock) This may be the turning point.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,Prepare another shot.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"Please, nurse, just follow orders, will you?"
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"There, that should do it."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,Just let him rest now.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"(to Tomar) You see, it's a flare-up of Rigelian Kassaba Fever."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"He suffered from it about ten years ago, and it recurs every now and then."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,There's no danger if he gets medication in time.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,He'll be all right in a couple of hours.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,We're just going to jam it.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,Scotty tells me you could've destroyed the ship in the barrier.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,Why didn't you?
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,But that was our only chance to stop them
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,Jim
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"Jim, I saw them reduce four of my doctors and nurses into those little"
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"Before you condemn it, why not try it?"
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"All right, I'll show you how to work the selector."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,I'm delighted.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"If he keeps reacting like that, he's going to need a diet."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,I don't know about that.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"Well, that body of yours is a bit anaemic."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,Comes from taking food in pills instead of solid sustenance.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,I'm going to give you a shot.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,High-potency vitamin concentrate.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,You'll need three a day for a few days.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"And eat some solid food, will you?"
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"Well, now, let's see."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,You've had three shots.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,"I think you better stay on them for a few days, and then we'll see how you're responding."
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,We haven't seen Tomar either.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,But my man Hanar is getting more irritable by the minute.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,I'm giving him shots of formazine.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,That should have him climbing the walls.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,Hmm?
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,Oh.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,You will pardon us.
MCCOY,By Any Other Name,Seems to me that little planet you were on is kind of nice.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,No sign of the spaceship.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,No sign of debris.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,But where are they?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"I'm Captain James T. Kirk, of the starship Enterprise."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,We came in answer to your distress call.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"You have a very strange sense of humour, Mister"
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Stay there.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,It's all right.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,What do you want?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Voyage?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Where?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Andromeda?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Why?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Well, sorry."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,This galaxy is already occupied.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,What's the point of capturing my ship?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Even at maximum warp, the Enterprise couldn't get to Andromeda galaxy for thousands of years."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,What happened to your ship?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Yes, I know."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,We've been there.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Rojan, there's no reason to do this by force."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Let's take your problem to the Federation.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Research expeditions have catalogued hundreds of uninhabited planets in this galaxy suitable for colonization.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,The Federation has handled foreign invasions before.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,All right.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,We can't break out.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,There must be another way.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,That's a very good question.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Spock, what are the odds in such absolute duplication of life forms in another galaxy?"
KIRK,By Any Other Name,They have the paralysis field.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Rojan mentioned something about a central projector.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Those devices on their belts might indicate the source of the force field.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"You'll get your chance, but you'll do it under orders."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"On Eminiar Seven, you were able to trick the guard by a Vulcan mind probe."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Do you think you can do it again?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Are you all right?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,I'm responsible.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Let them go.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,What was it?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Perhaps practicality.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,They chose the Enterprise as the best vessel for the trip.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Immense beings with a hundred tentacles would have difficulty with the turbolift.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,We've got to stop them.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,We outnumber them.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Their only hold on us is the paralysis field.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Jam.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Spock, if you reverse the circuits on McCoy's neuro-analyser, can you set up a counter field to jam the paralysis projector?"
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Is there a chance at all?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,We'll take it.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,You and Bones have to get to the ship.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Yes.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Mister Spock, you're sick."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"No, you're not."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Doctor McCoy has given you an thorough examination, and you're ill."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"In fact, if you don't get to the sickbay, you're going to die."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Vulcans have the ability to place themselves in a kind of trance, complete relaxation of every part of the mind and body."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Can you do it now and come out of it in the sickbay, say in half an hour?"
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Go ahead.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,(goes to the door) Hanar?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Hanar.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Mister Spock is ill.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,The doctor thinks he may be dying.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,He's a Vulcan.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,They don't react like humans.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Do what you can with him, Bones."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,What do you want from me now?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,My duty is to stop you in any way I can.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Or you will kill more of my people?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Flowers.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,I don't know the variety.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,A rose by any other name.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"A quote from a great human poet, Shakespeare."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Increase speed to warp eleven, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Rojan, I'm going to sickbay."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,My first officer was taken ill.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Anything?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Well?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,What alternative?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,What?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Are you mad?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,I can't just
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Reading, Spock."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Hold your position.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Thank you.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,So are yours.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,What neutralising operation?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,No!
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Is this all?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,I couldn't.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,I didn't think it was.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Bones, that's enough!"
KIRK,By Any Other Name,They've reduced the whole crew!
KIRK,By Any Other Name,(thumps table in anger)
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"It's your idea, Doctor."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Go ahead.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Even if we could, it's out of the question."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,We need that projector to bring our people back to human form.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,What is?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,But then Tomar shouldn't be enjoying the taste of his food.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"If they all respond to stimulation of the senses, then maybe we can distract them."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,They can't have been able to handle the senses yet.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"If we can confuse them enough, we can get those devices from their belts."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,All right.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,It may be our only chance.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Look for any way to stimulate the senses.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Am I disturbing you?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,I wish to apologise.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,For hitting you.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,I'm sorry.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Yes, well, I don't usually go around beating up beautiful women."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Well, there are better things for men and women to do."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Is this where I hit you?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Oh.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,I'm sorry.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,(he kisses it) Is that better?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,This is.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Well, among humans, it's meant to express warmth and love."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Me?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,We enjoy it.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Kelinda, I'm sorry I brought up the whole subject."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,I did.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Not when I came in.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"The thing is, I can't tell if we're getting anywhere."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,And I haven't seen Scotty in hours.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,You had something to say?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Yes?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Yes.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,We do think a great deal about it.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,You have a question?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"Yes, that's too bad."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Why do you defy him?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Huh.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,And how's the research going?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"That's not enough, Rojan."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"If you can't keep her, that's not my problem."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Why don't you use your paralyser?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,You thought I was taking your woman away from you.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,You're jealous!
KIRK,By Any Other Name,You tried to kill me with your bare hands.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Would a Kelvan do that?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Would he have to?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,You're reacting with the emotions of a human.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,You are a human.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,I'm stimulating him.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,(McCoy pushes him back into the fight.)
KIRK,By Any Other Name,You have no choice.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"To use this ship, you have to use our form and now you're stuck with it, you and your descendants, for the next three hundred years."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Look what's happened in the short time you've been exposed to us.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,What do you think will happen in three centuries?
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"When this ship gets to Kelva, the people on it will be human."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,They'll be aliens.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Enemies!
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Your mission is to find new worlds for your people to live in.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,You can still do that.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,We can bring this problem to the Federation.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,There are many planets in this galaxy that can be inhabited.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,No.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,But we would welcome friends.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,"You see, Rojan, being human does have certain advantages."
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Being able to appreciate the beauty of a flower or a woman.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,Turn the ship around.
KIRK,By Any Other Name,We're going home.
THOMPSON,By Any Other Name,"Captain, I'm getting a reading now."
THOMPSON,By Any Other Name,Two human forms at bearing three hundred mark seven.
THOMPSON,By Any Other Name,Captain.
THOMPSON,By Any Other Name,You made a voyage of three hundred years?
THOMPSON,By Any Other Name,"Captain, what do they want from us."
THOMPSON,By Any Other Name,What kind of people are they?
THOMPSON,By Any Other Name,Captain?
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"It was very kind of you to respond so quickly, captain."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Now you will surrender your ship to me.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,I am Rojan of Kelva.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,I am your commander from this moment on.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Any efforts to resist us or to escape will be severely punished.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Soon we, and you, will leave this galaxy forever."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,You humans must face the end of your existence as you have known it.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,You are all paralyzed by a selective field that neutralises nerve impulses to the voluntary muscles.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We can control you at will.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,I will now release you.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Yes.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Radiating from a central projector.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Your ship, Captain Kirk."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,It will serve us well in the long voyage that is to come.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"To your neighbouring galaxy, which you call Andromeda."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,It is our home.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Within ten millennia, high radiation levels in our galaxy will make life there impossible."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"So the Kelvan Empire sent forth ships to explore other galaxies, to search for one which our race could conquer and occupy."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Captain, you think you are unconquerable and your ship impregnable, but while we've talked, the capture has already begun."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Report, Hanar."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Proceed with your orders.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Captain, we will modify its engines, in order to produce velocities far beyond the reach of your science."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,The journey between galaxies will take less than three hundred of your years.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,And our mission will be completed by a commander who is my descendant.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,There is an energy barrier at the rim of your galaxy.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We managed to break through it with great difficulty.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Our ship was destroyed.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We barely managed to escape in a lifecraft.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,And now we have the means to begin our journey back to Andromeda.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,No form of transmission can penetrate the barrier.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We do not colonize.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We conquer.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We rule.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,There's no other way for us.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Captain, we can control the Federation as easily as we can control you."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,The fate of the inferior in any galaxy.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Kelinda, take them to the holding area."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"We'll keep you and your party here, Captain."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Your crew will undoubtedly wish to co-operate with us if they understand that you are hostages.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Space again, Hanar."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,I do not think we could have kept our sanity living too long on this accursed planet.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Yes, but disturbing."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"These shells in which we've encased ourselves, they have such heightened senses."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,To feel.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,To hear.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,To smell.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,How do humans manage to exist in these fragile cases?
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,At least we'll be away from all of this openness.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"This is too strange for us, Hanar."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"We are creatures of outer space, and soon we will be safe in the comforting closeness of walls."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,(releasing Kirk) This cannot go unpunished.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Hanar.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,That one.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,(the guard) Take him aside.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Kelinda, the female."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Go.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"As a leader, you realize the importance of discipline."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"I need you and these other specialists, but those two are unnecessary."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"I think we're somewhat alike, Captain."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Each of us cares less for his own safety than for the lives of his command.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We feel pain when others suffer for our mistakes.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Your punishment shall be to watch them die.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Captain.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Proceed, Hanar."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Bring them to me.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,This is the essence of what they were.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"The flesh and brain and what you call the personality, distilled down into these compact shapes."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,And once crushed (he demonstrates) this person is dead.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"However, that one can be restored."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,(throws it on the ground) Hanar?
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We will beam aboard the vessel shortly.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,I wish you to understand your duties.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,You will obey.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Captain Kirk, I cannot believe that you do not understand the importance of my mission."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We Kelvans have a code of honour.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Harsh, demanding."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,It calls for much from us and much from those whom we conquer.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,You have been conquered.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"I respect your devotion to your duty, but I cannot permit it to interfere with mine."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Drea has computed and laid a course for Kelva, Captain."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,And we'll go faster yet.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Increase speed to warp eleven.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Very well.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Yes, I was informed."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,You may go.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Take your places, gentlemen."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We're approaching the barrier.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Your people are most efficient, Captain."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Hanar, start the neutralising operation."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,You humans are troublesome for us.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We needed you to get us through the barrier.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,But there aren't enough of us to efficiently guard all of you of the time.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Further, the food synthesisers cannot manufacture enough food for the entire journey."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We are therefore neutralising all nonessential personnel.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,The procedure is already underway.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Now, as to bridge personnel."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Drea?
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We have no need for communication.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,And since Drea is capable of handling the ship from here on.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Do you not agree that this is better thing for them than exploding the ship as your engineer had thought to do?
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"We detected it, of course."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Tomar has devised a mechanism to prevent any further tampering.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Please accept your situation, Captain."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,It will make things much less painful.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Is there some problem, Captain?"
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,What did he want here?
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,In what manner?
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"(she kisses him) Very odd creatures, these humans."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Well, I do not understand this business of pressing with the lips to apologise."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Kelinda has no affection for Captain Kirk.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Why should I be disturbed?
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,I have no reason for such a reaction.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Kelinda's a female, nothing more."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Well, of course she is!"
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,No!
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Certainly not.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Kelinda, I've been thinking."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,I do not wish you to fraternise with any of the humans.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Well, they, they offer such strange ideas."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,They're not meant for us.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Not for Kelvans.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,No.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,And I wish you to particularly avoid Captain Kirk.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"You will do as I say, or I will neutralise your Captain Kirk and all the other humans as well."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Very well.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,It's the way your duties have always been assigned.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Hanar!
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Hanar, confine yourself to your quarters!"
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Mister Spock, you were not ordered to the bridge."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,What is your purpose here?
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Very well.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Proceed.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Have you seen Captain Kirk?
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,No.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,I was wondering where he was.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,He was alone then.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,I told her to stay away from him.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Kelinda, I told you to avoid this human."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,I am your commander.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"You did this to her, corrupted her, turned her away from me!"
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,You will release her!
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"No, I cannot be!"
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,You fool.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,These bodies are tools.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We remain Kelvans!
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"We have a duty, our mission."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,We've got to accomplish any way we can.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,You would really do that?
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,You would extend welcome to invaders?
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Perhaps.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Perhaps it could be done.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"But if we retain this form, where could we find a place?"
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,And you.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,You would wish to remain with him?
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Yes.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,Very curious.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,"Bridge, this is Rojan."
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,I'm returning command of the ship to Captain Kirk.
ROJAN,By Any Other Name,You will follow his orders.
CHEKOV,By Any Other Name,Something penetrating from the planet.
CHEKOV,By Any Other Name,"It's dead, sir."
CHEKOV,By Any Other Name,All major power disabled.
CHEKOV,By Any Other Name,We've jumped to warp eight.
CHEKOV,By Any Other Name,We made it.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,Increase power to shields.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,Sound Red Alert.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"Engineering, come in."
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,I've tied in all the lab computers.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,That will give it a bit more power to push with.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,This is it.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,Now all we have to do
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,Why?
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"That's it, then."
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,I see what you're getting at.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,I can't say I like it.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,I have opened the control valves to the matter-anti-matter nacelles.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"On your signal, I will flood them with positive energy."
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,And so will we.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"Outside hull temperatures rising, sir."
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,It's over two thousand degrees now.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,Sir?
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"Several systems out, sir."
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,Operating on emergency backup.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,None affect flight procedure.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"(whispering) Sir, why don't we try again to knock out the paralysis projector?"
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"I know the casing looks impenetrable, but I may be able to do something."
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,Then how will we stop the Kelvans?
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,I can think of one way right off.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"(goes over to Tomar) Lad, you're going to need something to wash that down with."
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,Have you ever tried any Saurian brandy?
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,Not of this.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"I found this on Ganymood, er, Ganymede."
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"Well, it's, er."
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"(peers at it, sniffs it) It's green."
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"All I have is a bottle of very, very, very old Scotch."
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,Whisky!
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,I'll get it!
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"(takes the helmet off a breastplate and reaches in, removing a very dusty bottle.)"
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,I was saving you for
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,Never mind.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,Gie us your glass.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,"We did it, you and me."
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,Put him right under the table.
SCOTT,By Any Other Name,(takes the paralyser off Tomar's belt) I'll take this to the captain.
UHURA,By Any Other Name,Red Alert.
UHURA,By Any Other Name,"All personnel, man your battle stations."
UHURA,By Any Other Name,Go to Red Alert.
UHURA,By Any Other Name,"Life support, come in."
UHURA,By Any Other Name,All decks report.
UHURA,By Any Other Name,Damage and casualties.
UHURA,By Any Other Name,"I'll have a full report on ship's status for you in a moment, sir."
HANAR,By Any Other Name,"Drea, Tomar, report."
HANAR,By Any Other Name,"Rojan, Hanar here."
HANAR,By Any Other Name,The ship is ours.
HANAR,By Any Other Name,"We control the bridge, engineering, and life support systems."
HANAR,By Any Other Name,"All is proceeding according to plan, Rojan."
HANAR,By Any Other Name,Tomar has examined the ship.
HANAR,By Any Other Name,The modifications are underway.
HANAR,By Any Other Name,It is an undisciplined environment.
HANAR,By Any Other Name,One cannot control it.
HANAR,By Any Other Name,Yet there are things of interest.
HANAR,By Any Other Name,"Since the ship was designed to sustain these forms, we have little choice."
HANAR,By Any Other Name,"What do you want, human?"
HANAR,By Any Other Name,This illness came on him rather suddenly.
HANAR,By Any Other Name,Is it not unusual?
HANAR,By Any Other Name,Stand away from the door.
HANAR,By Any Other Name,(enters the cell for a closer look) I will have you beamed aboard.
HANAR,By Any Other Name,Please articulate.
HANAR,By Any Other Name,What are you doing?
HANAR,By Any Other Name,How many more of these?
HANAR,By Any Other Name,I see no reason for you to refer to yourself in the plural.
HANAR,By Any Other Name,"Rojan, I want to talk to you."
HANAR,By Any Other Name,"First, I do not like the way responsibility and duty has been portioned out to us."
HANAR,By Any Other Name,That is my second quarrel with you.
HANAR,By Any Other Name,"And further, I do not care much for the way you run this ship."
DREA,By Any Other Name,"Life support control, secure."
DREA,By Any Other Name,On course and proceeding as planned.
DREA,By Any Other Name,We will approach the barrier within an hour.
DREA,By Any Other Name,"Captain Kirk to the bridge, please."
DREA,By Any Other Name,"Yes, Commander."
DREA,By Any Other Name,Sir?
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,Engineering is secure.
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,Very well.
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,I will inform Rojan.
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,You will stay here.
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,I do not understand why you take the trouble to consume this bulk material to sustain yourselves.
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,(holds up a pill box) We have ascertained that these contain all the nutritional elements.
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,I believe I will.
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,Assist me.
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,It's quite good.
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,No more.
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,Do you have more?
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,Anything.
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,What is it?
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,You have more?
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,I will try it.
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,What?
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,Very interesting.
TOMAR,By Any Other Name,But I feel rather strange.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Our ships were of multigeneration design.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,We were born in the intergalactic void.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,We shall die there during our return journey.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Move there.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,(picking a flower and smelling it) These are lovely.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,"Captain Kirk, what is it you call them?"
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Our memory tapes tell us of such things on Kelvan.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,"Crystals that form with such rapidity, they seem to grow."
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,They look like this fragile thing somewhat.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,We call them Sahsheer.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Captain?
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,What is it you wish?
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,"I don't understand, Captain."
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,That is not necessary.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,You attempted to escape as we would have.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Why not?
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Like what?
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,"No, the other side."
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Better?
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Was it intended as a remedy?
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Is there some significance to this action?
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Oh.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,You are trying to seduce me.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,I have been studying you.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,All humans.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,This business of love.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,You have devoted much literature to it.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Why do you build such a mystique around a simple biological function?
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,The literature?
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Do you really regard this touching of the lips as pleasurable?
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Curious.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Let me try.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,He came to apologise for hitting me.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Apparently it involves some peculiar touching contact.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Yes?
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Why not?
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Have you given this order to the others?
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,I will not.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,"You have told me over and over again, humans are no threat to us."
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,We are superior.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,I will do as I please.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,"I would like to speak with you, Captain."
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Yes.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,This cultural mystique surrounding the biological function.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,You realise humans are overly preoccupied with the subject.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,"I've done some supplemental reading on it, and, er"
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,Yes.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,"I was wondering, would you please apologise to me again?"
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,(coming up for air) Rojan has forbidden me to see you.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,It's not a question of defiance.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,We were told to find out everything we could about you.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,I need some more experiments.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,I did not wish to.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,"He's most interesting, but I wish to go with you."
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,I believe I owe you an apology.
KELINDA,By Any Other Name,(she kisses Rojan) It's most pleasurable.
GUARD,By Any Other Name,Captain.
GUARD,By Any Other Name,(Kalinda has appeared so they move away from the door) Captain.
GUARD,By Any Other Name,"However perfect they are, there don't seem to be very many of them."
GUARD,By Any Other Name,Why...
GUARD,By Any Other Name,"You'll have one, sir, if I have to rip one of the Kelvans apart to get it for you."
GUARD,By Any Other Name,"Yes, sir."
CHAPEL,By Any Other Name,"Doctor, what happened?"
CHAPEL,By Any Other Name,Stokaline?
CHAPEL,By Any Other Name,"But, doctor, that's"
CHAPEL,By Any Other Name,"But, Doctor"
SULU,Return To Tomorrow,"The reading's growing stronger, Captain."
SULU,Return To Tomorrow,Coming from a star system directly ahead.
SULU,Return To Tomorrow,"Planet dead ahead, Captain."
SULU,Return To Tomorrow,Becoming visual.
SULU,Return To Tomorrow,"All power gone, sir."
SULU,Return To Tomorrow,All normal.
SULU,Return To Tomorrow,No damage at all.
UHURA,Return To Tomorrow,"It's not a signal, sir."
UHURA,Return To Tomorrow,"It does not seem to even exist, and yet it's affecting all my channels."
UHURA,Return To Tomorrow,"No, sir."
UHURA,Return To Tomorrow,"Over three weeks at this distance, sir."
UHURA,Return To Tomorrow,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Well?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Someone or something has succeeded.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Our distress signal relays have been activated.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"We've been given a direction to follow, but how?"
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,What's causing it?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Close to Earth conditions.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Who are you, Sargon?"
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Is that a request or demand?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,The planet is dead.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,There's no possibility of life there as we understand life.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"(dictating log) Since exploration and contact with alien intelligences is our primary mission, I've decided to risk the potential dangers and resume contact."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Log entry out.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,How long before Starfleet receives that?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Got something?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Lieutenant Uhura, have Doctor McCoy report to the transporter room in ten minutes with standard landing party equipment."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Spock.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"And I would like to have my science officer with me on something as unusual as this, but it is full of unknowns and we can't risk both of us being off the ship."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"On the other hand, perhaps this Sargon would like you to come with us."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I see.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Will you transport down with us, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Mister Sulu, you have the conn."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Easy, Bones."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"As long as you know there's something down there, you know as much as we do."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,The rest is only guesses.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I have a feeling that they or it could destroy us just standing here if they or it wanted to.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Who are you?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,By whom?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Oh, yes."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"No, we're not."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Let's go.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Doctor, if you prefer to stay behind?"
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Kirk here.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Yes, Scotty, and I shouldn't be able to this deep inside the planet, but perhaps this has been arranged for us, too."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Is the security guard up there?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,No problem yet.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Maintain alert.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Kirk out.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Composition of walls?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Is that for us, or does it need fresh air?"
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Impossible.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,That's twice you've referred to us as my children.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,A war?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Then perhaps your intelligence wasn't so great, Sargon."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,We faced a similar crisis in our early nuclear age.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,We found the wisdom not to destroy ourselves.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I don't understand.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,You said you wanted our help.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,What is it you wish?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I am Sargon.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,He is unharmed.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I have taken his body to demonstrate
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Lungs filled with air again.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,To see again.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Heart pumping, arteries surging with blood again."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,A half a million years.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,To be again.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Your captain has an excellent body, Doctor McCoy."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I compliment you both on the condition in which you maintained it.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Have no fear.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Your captain is quite unharmed, although his mind generates insufficient energy for him to speak from there as I do."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"In the next room, there are other receptacles."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,The other two of us that survived.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"You, Doctor Ann Mulhall, and you, Mister Spock, we require your bodies also."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,We must have Captain Kirk and you so that we may live again.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Even for us, a half million years is almost too long to wait."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Two others still survive.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Henoch and Thalassa.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Thalassa, my Thalassa."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I am pleased you survived with me.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Forgive me.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,It has been so very long.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Only the best minds were chosen to survive.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Thalassa, my wife, as you may have guessed."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Henoch, from the other side."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Realising our mistake, we attempted to perpetuate both sides."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,We built this chamber here in order to preserve our essence in this fashion.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"We knew the seed that we had planted on other planets would take root, that one day you would build vessels as we did, and one day you would come here."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,To steal?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,To take them from you?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"No, no, my children, you misunderstand."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,We mean only that you should lend us your bodies for a short time.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I will return your captain to you before the body limit has been reached.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,To build.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,To build humanoid robots.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"We must borrow your bodies long enough to have the use of your hands, your fingers."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,No.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Our methods, our skills are far beyond your abilities."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,It is time.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Yes.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Sargon borrowed my body.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I was floating in time and space.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Spock, I remember."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"When Sargon and I exchanged, as we passed each other, for an instant we were one."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I know him now.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"I know what he is and what he wants, and I don't fear him."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Sargon.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,A simple transference.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Their minds and ours.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Scotty, I need your approval, too."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Since you'll work with them, furnishing them all they need to make the android robots."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Bones, they'll show us medical advances, miracles you never dreamed possible."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Scotty, engineering advances."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Vessels this size with engines the size of walnuts.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,They selected us as the most compatible bodies.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Bones?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,You could stop all this by saying no.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,That's why I called you all here together.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,We'll all be deeply involved.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,It must be unanimous.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"They used to say if man could fly, he'd have wings."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,But he did fly.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,He discovered he had to.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Do you wish that the first Apollo mission hadn't reached the moon, or that we hadn't gone on to Mars and then to the nearest star?"
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,That's like saying you wish that you still operated with scalpels and sewed your patients up with catgut like your great-great-great-great-grandfather used to.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I'm in command.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I could order this.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"But I'm not because, Doctor McCoy is right in pointing out the enormous danger potential in any contact with life and intelligence as fantastically advanced as this."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"But I must point out that the possibilities, the potential for knowledge and advancement is equally great."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Risk.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Risk is our business.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,That's what the starship is all about.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,That's why we're aboard her.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,You may dissent without prejudice.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Do I hear a negative vote?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"(silence around the table) Engineer, stand by to beam aboard three receptacles."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Ready, Sargon."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,(with echoy Sargon voice) The transference is complete.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Here.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,In this body.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"And I too am pleased, beloved."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Kiss.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,We will vacate at once until you can administer a metabolic reduction injection.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Henoch, your condition?"
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Fortunate.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,We will vacate at once.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Bones, what?"
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I remember.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,You held my hand like this.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I think it best not to remember so well.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Our minds will have survived.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"And as androids, we can move among the people who do live, teaching them, helping them not to make the errors we did."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Nothing.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Our next injection will renovate me.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Do not be concerned.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Sickbay.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Sargon here, McCoy."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I'm in your deck six briefing room.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Nothing of importance.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Fatigue perhaps.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Yes.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I wanted to be certain there was no error.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Formula is correct.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Don't be concerned.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,It is an excellent body.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,There.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,You see?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,I feel better already.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"That will take months, perhaps years."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"We haven't that choice, Thalassa."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"No, beloved."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,If we torment ourselves
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Our thoughts will intertwine.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Yes, I'm fine, Bones."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,It was necessary.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Bones, prepare a hypo."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"The fastest, deadliest poison to Vulcans."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Spock's consciousness is gone.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"We must kill his body, the thing in it."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Spock.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,My friend Spock.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,If there'd only been another way.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,You're alive.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"But your vessel was destroyed, too."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Where was your consciousness kept?
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Is there any way we can help you, Sargon?"
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"I promise, beloved."
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Forever beloved.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,Forever.
KIRK,Return To Tomorrow,"Well, I'm sure that Sargon appreciated your co-operation, Doctor Mulhall."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Someone or something is attempting to attract our attention.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,I do not know.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Not even a Vulcan can know the unknown, Captain."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,We are hundreds of light years past where any Earth ship has ever explored.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Class M planet, Captain."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,With two very important exceptions.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"It's much older than Earth, and about a half million years ago, its atmosphere was totally ripped away by some sort of cataclysm."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,The planet has evidently been dead since then.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Sensors detect no life of any kind.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Captain.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Sensors registering some form of energy deep inside the planet.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Reading energy only, Captain."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,No life forms.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Coming from deep under the planet's surface, Captain."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Under at least one hundred miles of solid rock.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Reading a chamber now.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, suitable for human life support."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Captain, I do wish to inspect whatever this is that lived that long ago."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Evidently, Captain."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Unlikely.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,These co-ordinates correspond with the location of the subterranean chamber.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"I'm sure she did, Captain, Just as you received an order to bring me along."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Approximately one hundred twelve point three seven miles, Doctor."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Captain, the security guards."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,This vault was constructed about a half a million years ago.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"About the same time the planet surface was destroyed, if our sensor readings are accurate."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,They're an alloy or substance completely unknown to me.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Much stronger and harder than anything I've measured before.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Sargon, would it harm you if I"
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Pure energy.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Matter without form.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"That would tend, however, to explain certain elements of Vulcan prehistory."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Just a moment, Doctor."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"And if he refuses, Doctor, what do you propose to do with your phaser?"
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,That is still Jim's body.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,What are your plans for it?
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Can you exchange places again when you wish?
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Doctor?
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,What is it you want of us?
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,When the struggle came which devastated your planet
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"These others, they were stored differently than you, but it was your task to remain in the receptacle out there KIRK: and search the heavens with my mind, probing, waiting, probing."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,And then one day my mind touched your vessel and brought you here.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Our bodies, Sargon, for what purpose?"
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Then you intend to construct mechanical bodies, move your minds into them, and then return our bodies to us."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Captain, do you know what happened?"
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Do you remember any part of it?
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Once inside their mechanical bodies, engineer, they can leave this planet, travel back with us."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"With their knowledge, mankind could leap ahead ten thousand years."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"No, he's not."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,(with a grin and echoy voice) Hello.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Oh, you are a lovely female."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,A pleasant sight to wake up to after half a million years.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,You're welcome.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"This is an excellent body, Doctor."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,I seem to have received the best of the three.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Strength, hearing, eyesight, all far above your human norms."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,I'm surprised the Vulcans never conquered your race.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Yes, of course, Just as we do, Doctor."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"It will be unnecessary, Doctor."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,This Vulcan body is accustomed to the higher metabolism.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"I'll prepare the formula, Sargon."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,I can continue in this body for several hours.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,This woman will assist me.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,(to Chapel) You will take me to your pharmacology laboratory.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Now.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,this formula will reduce the heart action and the bodily functions to normal.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"While the bodies are occupied, you will administer one injection of ten cc's each hour."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,This hypo you will code mark for Thalassa.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,And this one you will code mark for me.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,This one you will administer to Captain Kirk while Sargon is in his body.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"No, that's correct."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"But since I will arrange for you to administer each of the injections, no one else will notice."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,What were you saying?
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Yes.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Well, you were about to say that you watched me prepare the formula and fill each of the hypos."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Very good.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"You see, Sargon would not permit me to keep this body."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,It is therefore necessary for you to kill your captain so that Sargon will die with him.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"In two days, you'll have your own hands, Thalassa."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Mechanically efficient and quite human-looking.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Android robot hands, of course."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Hands without feeling.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Enjoy the taste of life while you can.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"It will have twice the strength and agility of your body, engineer, and will last a thousand years."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"That is, assuming you'll stop wasting your time and allow us to complete it."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"A thousand-year prison, Thalassa."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"And when it wears out we'll build another one, and we'll lock ourselves into it for another thousand years."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"And another, and another."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Sargon has closed his mind to a better way.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,With these bodies.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"When you awoke in this body, Thalassa, you said how good it was to breathe again, to have eyes and to see again."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,To feel.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"To live and feel again, Thalassa."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Just think how much we can do for mankind.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Are these bodies too much to ask for in return?
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Would you prefer this?
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"This is your new home, Thalassa."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Once occupied, I'll add female features and some texturing."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,You no doubt want the mechanism to at least appear to be a woman.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,(he tests its hand movement.)
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"It is ready, Thalassa."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,You have no excuse to keep the real body any longer.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Sargon would've required that you enter the mechanism immediately.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Must I make an example of you, too, Helm?"
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Pain, Captain."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"And you, my dear?"
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"Fortunately, Doctor, I know every thought of every mind around me."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,See?
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,(to Chapel) Take the hypo from him.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,And inject him with it.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Fools.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"I'll simply transfer to another place, another body."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Sargon!
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"No, Sargon, please."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Let me.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,Let me transfer.
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"It seems, Doctor, the injection was only enough to cause unconsciousness."
SPOCK,Return To Tomorrow,"The place Henoch would least suspect, Captain."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"All of your questions will be answered in time, Captain Kirk."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,I am Sargon.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,It is the energy of my thoughts which has touched your instruments and directed you here.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,Now with this closer distance I can speak to you at last.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"Please assume a standard orbit about our planet, Captain."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,The choice is yours.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,I read what is in your mind.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,Words are unnecessary.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,And I am as dead as my planet.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"Does that frighten you, James Kirk?"
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"For if it does, if you let what is left of me perish, then all of you, my children, all of mankind must perish, too."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"Your probes have touched me, Mister Spock."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,I have locked your transporter device on my co-ordinates.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,Please come to us.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,Rescue us from oblivion.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,I will make it possible for your transporter to beam you that deep beneath the surface.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,Have no fear.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,Please stand ready.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,I will operate your controls.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,(the glowing sphere) Welcome.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,I am Sargon.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"You may use your tricorder, Mister Spock."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,Your readings will show energy but no substance.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,Sealed in this receptacle is the essence of my mind.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"A body much as yours, my children, although our minds were infinitely greater."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"Because it is possible you are our descendants, Captain Kirk."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"Six thousand centuries ago, our vessels were colonising this galaxy, just as your own starships have now begun to explore that vastness."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"As you now leave your own seed on distant planets, so we left our seed behind us."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,Perhaps your own legends of an Adam and an Eve were two of our travellers.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"In either case, I do not know."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"It was so long ago, and the records of our travels were lost in the cataclysm which we loosened upon ourselves."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,A struggle for such goals and the unleashing of such power that you could not comprehend.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"And we survived our primitive nuclear era, my son."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,But there comes to all races an ultimate crisis which you have yet to face.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"One day our minds became so powerful, we dared think of ourselves as gods."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"I understand, my son."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,Go to your vessel.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,All who are involved must agree to this.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"After all these centuries, we can wait a few more hours."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,Then you may go as freely as you came.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"I am pleased, my beloved."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,It is good you have found the truth yourself.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"I have power even Henoch does not suspect, beloved."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,I could not allow your sacrifice of one so close to you.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"No, Doctor."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,I allowed you to believe that to be true so that Henoch would read your thoughts and believe it also.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,But Henoch believed and fled the body.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,He is destroyed.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"We now know we cannot permit ourselves to exist in your world, my children."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,Thalassa and I must now also depart into oblivion.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,"Yes, my son."
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,You can allow Thalassa and me to share your bodies again.
SARGON,Return To Tomorrow,A last moment together.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Jim, why no briefing on this?"
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,I'd at least like to know what we're getting into.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Inside solid rock?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Let's get back to this solid rock business.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Just how much rock are we going to go through?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Miles?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Are you joking?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,No.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"No, if I'd be useful, as long as you're going down, I might as well take a medical look at whatever this is."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,The air seems fresh.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,It must be re-circulated somehow.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,But you once had a body of some type?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Where's our captain?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Where's Jim Kirk?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,(drawing his phaser) I won't go along with this.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Back to where you were, Sargon, or whatever you are."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Are you aware of what's happening to his body?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Heart action doubled, temperature a hundred and four degrees?"
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"And destroy them, just as you're burning that one up now."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Heartbeat's two hundred and sixty two, Spock."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Entire metabolic rate correspondingly high.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Is it you, Jim?"
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"(a nod) Good, his metabolic rate is back to normal."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,He doesn't appear to be harmed.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Physically, anyway."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,That's the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,An alien practically hijacks your body and then corks you into a bottle and
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,And what if we should decide against you?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,No comment.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Quite simple.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Happens every day.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,It all seems rather indecent to me.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"They're giants, and we're insects beside them."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,They could destroy us without meaning to.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"And all he wants is the body of our captain and our second in command, too."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Coincidence?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"What's your attitude on that, Doctor?"
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Then I'll still want one question answered to my satisfaction.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Why?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Not a list of possible miracles, but a simple basic understandable why that overrides all danger."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,And let's not kid ourselves that there is no potential danger in this.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"The extreme power of the alien mind will drive the heart action dangerously high, and The body functions will race many times their normal metabolism, so we're going to have to monitor this very carefully."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Well, I guess we're as ready as we'll ever be, Jim."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Vulcans worship peace above all, Henoch."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Nurse!
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Henoch, you'd better get back to bed too."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Sargon, it won't work."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,You've got to get out before you kill them.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,A what?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"It was close, Jim."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,You both barely got back alive.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Unless the formula works, we can't risk it again."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"As planned, the construction of android robots is underway."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,All is proceeding as expected and as promised.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"I can find no reason for concern, but yet I am filled with foreboding."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Nurse, how are the last metabolic readings on our patients?"
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Is something wrong, Miss Chapel?"
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Regarding our patients?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"You look tired, Miss Chapel."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Perhaps you'd care for me to administer the last few injections.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Sickbay.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,McCoy.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,You sound terrible.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Wait there for me.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Hypo.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,He's dead.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Yes, we can keep them going for a few weeks, or a month."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,For all the good it'll do.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Yes?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,But you said that was impossible.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,I see.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"And Henoch intends to keep Spock's body, of course."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,If you're asking my approval
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Neither Jim nor I can trade a body we don't own.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,It happens to belong to a young woman.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,I will not peddle flesh.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,I'm a physician.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,This is Sickbay.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Get me
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Nurse Chapel, what in the devil?"
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Jim?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Are you all right?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Thalassa?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"Jim, the receptacles."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Spock's consciousness was in one of them.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,What are you talking about?
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,There is no Spock to return to his body.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,"You've killed a loyal officer, your best friend."
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Jim.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,There was enough poison in that hypo to kill ten Vulcans.
MCCOY,Return To Tomorrow,Sargon.
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,"I don't like it, sir."
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,The transporter co-ordinates preset by an alien of some sort.
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,You could materialise inside solid rock.
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,"Can you read me, Captain?"
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,They're fine.
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,They Just didn't dematerialise.
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,"I don't like it, sir."
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,You're going to what?
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,"Are they all right in the head, Doctor?"
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,Ach!
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,You're joking.
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,A starship engine the size of a walnut?
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,That's impossible.
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,But I don't suppose there'd be any harm in looking over diagrams on it.
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,For all the good it'll do you.
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,"It's a fancy name, but how will something that looks like a drop of jelly make this thing work?"
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,You'll need microgears and a pulley that does what a muscle does.
SCOTT,Return To Tomorrow,"I tell you, lady, this thing won't work."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,They or it?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Doctor Ann Mulhall, Astro-biology."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Well, I was ordered to report here for landing party duty."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Strange, I'm not sure."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Well, I'm not a liar, Captain."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,I did receive an order to report here for duty.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Atmosphere report, Captain."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"A fraction richer in oxygen than usual for us, but otherwise normal."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"All readings are off the scale, Captain."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Our beliefs and our studies indicate that life on our planet, Earth, evolved independently."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Yes, I have the same readings."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,He'll die if you don't leave his body.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Soon!
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,So you could steal our bodies from us?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"We have engineers, technicians."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Why can't they build your robots for you?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,I'm afraid that I must agree with Doctor McCoy.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,You could be suffering from a form of false euphoria.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"I'm not so certain of that, Doctor."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,It is scientifically fascinating.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Well, if we all agree, I'm willing to host Thalassa's mind."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,I'm a scientist.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"The opportunity is an extraordinary one for experimentation, observation."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,(echoy) I'd forgotten what it felt like even to breathe again.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Sargon?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"I am not displeased, my husband."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Your body is not unlike that which was your own.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,After so long.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,So very long.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Sargon, I remember a day long ago."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,We sat beside a silver lake.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,The air was scented with the flowers of our planet.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"What is it, Sargon?"
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Thank you.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Have you prepared the negaton hydracoils for the drawing Sargon supplied?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,That would be highly inefficient.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"They're not ours, Henoch."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,No.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,I'm beginning to hate it.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Sargon, what is it?"
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Henoch's formula.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"In time, a host body will become accustomed to us, husband."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Injections will no longer be necessary.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Husband.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Feel the touch of my hand, husband."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Beloved.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,What will that word mean to a machine?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Will they, husband?"
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Will they intertwine like this?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Can two minds press close like this?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Can robot lips do this?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"(they kiss, then Kirk falls gently to the floor) Sargon, what is it?"
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Doctor, help him!"
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Why pretend to work on that thing, Henoch?"
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,You know you never intended to leave Spock's body.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,No!
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,I cannot live in that thing.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Doctor.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Would you like to save your Captain Kirk?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,We have many powers Sargon did not permit us to use.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,He thought them too tempting to us.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,This body pleases me.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,I intend to keep it.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Henoch's plans are his own affair.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,I wish only to exist in peace as a living woman.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,I require only your silence.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Only you and I will know that Doctor Mulhall has not returned to her body.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Isn't that worth your captain's life?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Doctor, we can take what we wish."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Neither you, this ship, nor worlds have the power to stop us."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Who you hardly know.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Almost a stranger to you.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,A physician?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"In contrast to what we are, you are a prancing, savage medicine man."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,You dare defy one you should be on your knees worshipping?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,I could destroy you with a single thought.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Stop!
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,(the flames are gone) Sargon was right.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,The temptations within a living body are too great.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Forgive me.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Sargon?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Where are you?
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,I thought you destroyed by Henoch.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Yes.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Yes, I see."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,I understand.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Just as we would have placed our consciousness within robots, Sargon has placed his into your vessel."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Doctor, leave us."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Sargon has a plan.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,We have much work to do.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"She is now with Sargon, Doctor."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"I'm Ann Mulhall, back in my own body."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"Oblivion together does not frighten me, beloved."
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Promise we'll be together.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Together forever.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,Yes.
MULHALL,Return To Tomorrow,"I was happy to co-operate, Captain."
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,"Yes, sir."
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,"Metabolic rate is double and rising, Doctor."
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,Thank you.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,Doctor?
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,I understand.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,"Yes, sir."
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,This hypo does not contain the same formula.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,"Without the same formula, Captain Kirk will die."
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,I. I was.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,I wanted to say something.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,I've forgotten what it was.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,"Yes, that, that was it."
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,I will inform Doctor McCoy that each is properly filled for each patient.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,"You'll find them excellent, Doctor."
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,Well within normal.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,"Er, yes."
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,"I, er, I had something to say."
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,I can't seem to remember.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,Yes.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,That must be it.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,"I am so pleased the way they are responding, Doctor."
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,The formula's working perfectly.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,Tired?
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,"Well, not at all, Doctor."
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,Thank you for asking.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,Doctor.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,"That is why I was summoned into Sickbay, Doctor."
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,Mister Spock's consciousness was placed in me.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,We shared consciousness together.
CHAPEL,Return To Tomorrow,It was beautiful.
NURSE,Return To Tomorrow,"All his vital organs are now working, Doctor."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Passing outer planet, Zeon."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"I never met John Gill, but I studied Earth history from the text he prepared."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,What impressed me most was his treatment of Earth history as causes and motivations rather than dates and events.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Yes, but it must be a Zeon ship."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Zeons do have a crude interplanetary capability.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Reaction powered.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,A small rocket.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,It is on an intercept course.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,That would mean it has sophisticated detection devices which neither Zeon nor Ekos should have.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, it's an unmanned probe which seems to be carrying a warhead."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,A thermonuclear warhead.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Most interesting.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,We were attacked by a thermonuclear missile from a planet which should have no such weapon.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"According to our records, the Ekosians are a primitive, warlike people in a state of anarchy."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"The other planet, Zeon, has a relatively high technology, and its people are peaceful."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Ready, Captain."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"The Ekosians are humanoid, so there is apt to be a similarity in architecture."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Interesting.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, the non-interference Directive."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Mid-twentieth century Earth.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,The nation state called Nazi Germany.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Virtually impossible, Captain, yet the evidence is quite clear."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"You propose we pass ourselves off as Nazis, Captain?"
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"That's very well taken, Captain."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Yes.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Obviously he's not one of us.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,I captured him.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Is that not correct procedure with enemies of the Fatherland?
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Take charge of him.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Your uniform, Captain."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Quite correct.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,You should make a very convincing Nazi.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Yes.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"I shall tend to it, Major."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Obviously.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Why do the Nazis hate Zeons?
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Is Zeon a threat to them?
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,It would seem the assumption was premature.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,That would coincide with the time of John Gill's arrival.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, the flaw in the plan is this locked door, and the guard beyond it."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"To the logical mind, the outlook is somewhat gloomy."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Yes.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Of course.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,The rubindium crystals in the transponders.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Yes.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"We must hold the crystals rigidly at a specific distance, which I believe should be twenty seven point two millimetres."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Twenty seven point two millimetres would be, approximately, there."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"That is, of course, a crude estimation."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Yes.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"To reach that light, I shall require some sort of platform."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Now, the rubindium crystals should find enough power here to achieve the necessary stimulus."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"As I recall from the history of physics, the ancient lasers were able to achieve the necessary excitation, even using crude natural crystals."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Yes, of course, Captain."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,You realise that the aim will of course be very crude.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, why should I aim at such a structure?"
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"May I remind you, we did not intend to fight."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Possibly.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,I do not see them.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, without phasers, and until we are able to communicate with the ship, it is illogical to assume that we can hold out against the entire military force of this planet."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, I suggest the most profitable use of our time would be to reassemble our communicators."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,May I work undisturbed somewhere?
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"By using parts from both, I've completed one communicator."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"I do not know if the circuits are correct, Captain."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"There is no way to test it, except in actual use."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,The one receiving a medal.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"This young lady is a Nazi, a hero of the Fatherland."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,We saw her being decorated.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,That is correct.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"As an honoured member of the Party, she could get us past the guards."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, I'm beginning to understand why you Earthmen enjoy gambling."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"No matter how carefully one computes the odds of success, there is still a certain exhilaration in the risk."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, it was John Gill, but he never moved."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Never once looked up.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Or a deep psychosis.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,It may not have the range it had.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"In fact, it may not work at all."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Come in, Enterprise."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"If there's going to be a delay in transporting the doctor, I suggest we cancel our"
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"There is a logical way to proceed, Doctor."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Point your toe, apply equal pressure to either side of the boot, and push."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,We have no time for emotionalism.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Yes.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,A doctor should have more pride.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, I do not understand how he failed to recognise us."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,True.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,I shall reconsider.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, the speech follows no logical pattern."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,What drug?
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Captain.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"I have created a condition in which Gill cannot initiate speech or any other action, but he can reply to questions."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Quite correct.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"For the last few years, the real power has been Melakon."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Quite true, Captain."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"That tiny country, beaten, bankrupt, defeated, rose in a few years to stand only one step away from global domination."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Perhaps Gill felt that such a state, run benignly, could accomplish its efficiency without sadism."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Is he dead, Captain?"
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Indeed, Captain."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"With the union of two cultures, this system would make a fine addition to the Federation."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, I never will understand humans."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"How could a man as brilliant, a mind as logical as John Gill's, have made such a fatal error?"
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Thank you, Doctor."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,I was able to gather the meaning.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Yes.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Earthmen like Ramses, Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan."
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,Your whole Earth history is made up of men seeking absolute power.
SPOCK,Patterns Of Force,"Obviously, Doctor, you fail to accept"
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"We want the inner one, Ekos."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Plot a standard orbit, Mister Chekov, and take us in."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Lieutenant Uhura, raise John Gill on Starfleet communications."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"I don't know, Bones."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,We're here to find out what's happened because I don't know.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I knew him very well.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,He was my instructor at the Academy.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,From Ekos?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Have you raised anyone, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Stand by phasers.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Range, Mister Chekov?"
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Fire.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Maybe they had help.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Maximum orbit.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Take us out of range of their detection range.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Execute.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,We've run into a far more serious problem than the disappearance of John Gill.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Spock, you and I will beam down."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Bones, one precaution."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Prepare a subcutaneous transponder in the event we can't use our communicators.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Insert the transponders.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Make one low pass to communication range in three hours.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"If we fail to make contact at the appointed time, take our co-ordinates from the transponder and beam us aboard no matter what our condition may be."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You ready?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Energise.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Unbelievable.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Do you recognise those uniforms?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,How could this have happened?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"The chances of another planet developing a culture like Nazi Germany, using the forms, the symbols, the uniforms of twentieth century Earth are so fantastically slim."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"You look quite well for a man who's been utterly destroyed, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,That's John Gill.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,The Fuhrer?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You're right.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,He's not one of us.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Look at him.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Spock, take his uniform."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,If John Gill is the Fuhrer it would seem the logical approach.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,That helmet covers a multitude of sins.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Yes, it's a shame yours isn't as attractive as mine."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Gestapo, I believe."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Your orders, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,He wants to see your orders in the jacket.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,The Lieutenant's a little dazed.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,He captured several Zeons single-handed.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,One of the pigs struck him before he dropped.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I promise you that pig will never get up again.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Hail the Fuhrer.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"This is a day to remember, Major."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,We have urgent business with the Fuhrer.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"You're making this a rather one-sided conversation, Major."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Let me speak to your Fuhrer.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I'll tell him everything he wants to know.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I'll explain when I see the Fuhrer.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I'll discuss that only with him.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"John Gill was the kindest, gentlest man I ever knew."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,For him to be a Nazi is impossible.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Were they like this when you first came?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Do you know the plan of this building?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"If we can get to the SS weapons laboratory, get our weapons back, we might be able to stop the slaughter."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"We must get our communicators, contact the ship."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,The transponders.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"And a way to shed some light on the gloom, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I know it's there.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,McCoy put it in.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,There.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Do you have the figures computed?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"No, not a radio."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,The power from this light is very low.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"I would be honoured, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Oh, Mister Spock, the guard did a professional job on my back."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,(in pain) I don't care if you hit the broad side of a barn.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Just hurry, please."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Never mind, Spock."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Just get on with the job.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Oh, my goodness."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Beautiful.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Oh, Spock Spock!"
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,(Spock gets down) Beautiful.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Over there.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I'll create a commotion.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Help!
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Help!
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I'll talk!
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I'll talk!
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I can't stand it anymore!
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I'll talk!
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Guard!
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Guard, I'll talk!"
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Guard, I'll talk."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I'll talk.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,The pain
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Take him with us, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,He's got a point.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,He's our guide.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Which is the laboratory door?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"All right, Zeon pigs, move."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,(He stumbles against the Nazi.)
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Zeon pigs.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,They do nothing right.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Don't worry.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"They're on their way to the laboratory, for experimental work."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,They'll pay.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Move!
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Move, move."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,(giving the pistol to Isak) Cover the door.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Here they are.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"The communicators, disassembled."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Can you get one to work?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,(reading a clipboard) The alien pistols have been sent to Gestapo Command Headquarters.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Well, that takes care of the phasers."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"You Zeons, for peaceful people, are pretty thorough."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,We came for John Gill.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"All right, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You've made your point.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Get into the uniform and hide those ears again.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Hunting's good.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"We've caught so many Zeons, we've got to dump them outside."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I was trying to see the Fuhrer.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"If I can see him, there may be a way of stopping this insanity."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,The Enterprise won't be within range for another hour.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,The girl on the viewscreen.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Daras.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I must see the Fuhrer.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,It's urgent.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Melakon?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,How could this have seemed right to John Gill?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"John Gill, your Fuhrer."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,He's one of our people.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"This is my first officer, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"John Gill, your Fuhrer, was sent here by the Federation as a cultural observer."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"That was not his mission, ever."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"He was sent here to observe, not to interfere."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Something went wrong, and that's why we're here."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,To find out and to correct.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,We must see him.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Maximum security.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Is he so afraid?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I don't understand what's going on here.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,This goes against every principle that John Gill ever believed in.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Our only chance is to see him, and quickly."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Will you be there?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You must get us in there.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Lights.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Get me some lights on her.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Excuse me.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Very good, Spock."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,We may make a human of you yet.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Let's go.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Lights.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,(he films Eneg leaving) Thank you.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Where does the Fuhrer enter?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,They've got the booth curtained off.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Bring that light to the side of her face.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Where's the entrance to the broadcast booth?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,We're going to try.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Good.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"We're here to get John Gill, and alive, not for your personal satisfaction."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Is that clear?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Let's try down there.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Lights, please."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Gentlemen, this is for the record of the Fuhrer's Final Solution speech."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Smile, gentlemen."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,There will be more coverage later.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Thank you very much.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Let's get a moving shot down the hall.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Yes, well, that may be part of the plan, the semi-divine detachment."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,It may be simpler than that.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,He may be drugged.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,We need McCoy.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Is there a place, a room we can be alone for a few minutes?"
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,I'm going to send for help.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,It takes too long to explain.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Any place will do.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Think positively, Spock."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Captain here.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Put McCoy on.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,We've having difficulty.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Patch historical computer into uniform section.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"I want McCoy outfitted as a Gestapo doctor Nazi Germany, old Earth date 1944."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Make him a colonel.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,We found John Gill.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"At least, we've seen him."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"He may be drugged, hypnotised, or psychotic."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You'll have to make a determination.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Hurry with that uniform.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,What is it?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,What's happening up there?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Send him down naked if you have to.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Kirk out.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"This is Doctor McCoy, our Chief Medical Officer."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Daras, secretary to the National Socialist Party."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,The Colonel is drunk.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,He's had a little too much to drink.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Yes, he thought he would embarrass the Fuhrer."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Nor do I, but luck is something you also fail to recognise, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Let's go.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Watch his mouth.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Random sentences strung together.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"(to guards) Gentlemen, I want a picture of you two with the Hero of the Fatherland listening to the stirring Fuhrer's speech."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Get that light over there, please."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Get this light around here.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Smile, gentlemen."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Turn around, smile, and now."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,It's locked.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Keys.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Is there anything you do?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Take the risk.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Bones, increase the dosage."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Spock, try to get through to him with a mind probe."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"If you can't, Bones, you'll have to use a stronger stimulant, no matter what it does."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,That would mean the death of thousands of Ekosian spacemen.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"We could save Zeon, but what about Ekos?"
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Well done, Spock."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,They've kept what's left of him as a figure head.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Gill.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Gill, why did you abandon your mission?"
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Why did you interfere with this culture?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,But why Nazi Germany?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You studied history.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You knew what the Nazis were.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"But it was brutal, perverted, had to be destroyed at a terrible cost."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Why that example?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Why, Gill?"
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Why?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Gill.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Gill.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Gill, can you hear me?"
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You've got to tell those people what happened!
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You're the only one who can prevent the slaughter!
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Gill!
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Bones, give him another shot!"
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"We've run out of time, Bones."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"No, wait."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"(to Daras, with a rifle) Aim it at Spock."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Spock, take off the helmet."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,She captured a Zeon spy that was attempting to assassinate the Fuhrer.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,We'll make a present of him to Melakon.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Stay close to Spock.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Stall for time.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,And hope.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Professor Gill, can you hear me?"
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You've got to speak.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You've got to speak.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,This is our last chance.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Gill?
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Professor.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Professor!
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You've got to talk!
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You've got to tell them what happened.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You've got to come out of it.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Come on, Professor."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Come on.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Come on.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"You did that, Professor."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,You told them in time.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Dead.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,So is he.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Mister Spock, I think the planet is in good hands."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Beam us aboard.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,He drew the wrong conclusion from history.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"The problem with the Nazis wasn't simply that their leaders were evil, psychotic men."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"They were, but the main problem, I think, was the leader principle."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Gentlemen.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Gentlemen, we've just been through one civil war."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,Let's not start another.
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Mister Chekov, take us out of orbit."
KIRK,Patterns Of Force,"Warp factor two, and hurry."
CHEKOV,Patterns Of Force,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Patterns Of Force,Spacecraft approaching from inner planet.
CHEKOV,Patterns Of Force,Phasers ready.
CHEKOV,Patterns Of Force,"Two thousand kilometres, closing fast."
CHEKOV,Patterns Of Force,"Orbit computed and locked in, sir."
UHURA,Patterns Of Force,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, no response on any Starfleet channel."
UHURA,Patterns Of Force,"Nothing, sir."
UHURA,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, no response from John Gill on any channel."
UHURA,Patterns Of Force,Enterprise.
UHURA,Patterns Of Force,Lieutenant Uhura.
UHURA,Patterns Of Force,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,Patterns Of Force,"Captain, we're not reading you well."
UHURA,Patterns Of Force,You're nine points into the low-frequency band.
UHURA,Patterns Of Force,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,Patterns Of Force,"Doctor McCoy is having difficulty with that uniform, sir."
UHURA,Patterns Of Force,"Enterprise here, Captain."
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,Starfleet's been trying for six months.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,"If he's alive, isn't it unlikely that he'd receive us now?"
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,That's generations ahead of where these people should be technically.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,How'd they manage that?
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,He must be dead.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,And what's going on down there on Ekos?
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,"What have you got, Jim?"
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,Stupid computer made a mistake in the measurements.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,The right boot's too tight.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,How do you do?
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,What in blazes is this?
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,"He looks drugged, Jim."
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,Almost at a cataleptic state.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,I have to have a close look at him.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,"Definitely drugged, almost comatose."
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,I can't identify it without a medi-comp.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,"Without knowing, an antidote would be dangerous."
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,"I can give him a general stimulant, but it would be risky."
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,I'm working in the dark.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,I could kill him.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,The stimulant's working.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,He's reaching a level of consciousness.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,It's almost like he's in a light sleep.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,"Now, that's as much as I dare do."
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,"He's still alive, but the drug they use is too strong."
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,If I give him another shot
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,I don't dare.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,"What he's saying, Spock, is that a man who holds that much power, even with the best intentions, just can't resist the urge to play God."
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,It also proves another Earth saying.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,"Darn clever, these Earthmen, wouldn't you say?"
MCCOY,Patterns Of Force,"Spock, you obviously don't understand"
SCOTT,Patterns Of Force,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,Patterns Of Force,Whatever your condition.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Hide!
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,They're right behind me.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Hide!
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Hide!
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Why did they take you?
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,You're not a Zeon.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,He certainly is not one.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Why?
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Because without us to hate, there'd be nothing to hold them together."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"So the Party has built us into a threat, a disease to be wiped out."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Where did you come from?
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Our warlike period ended dozens of generations ago.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,We came here.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,We thought we were civilising the Ekosians.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Warlike, yes, but not vicious."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,That started when the Nazi movement began only a few years ago.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"When they've destroyed us here, they will attack our planet."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,They'll use the technology we gave them.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"The danger is that taking life is so repugnant to our people, I'm afraid we'll go down without a struggle."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"But after what I saw in the street today, I think I could kill."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Why?
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Why should you be interested in saving Zeons?
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Are you trying to kill yourselves?
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"What is it you're making, some kind of radio?"
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Take me with you.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Give me a chance to fight them.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Take me with you, or you'll never find the laboratory."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,The end of the hall.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Who are you people?
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Where do you come from?
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Yes.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"With this uniform, we can steal a car, get out of the capital."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,It's all right.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,They helped me escape from the prison.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,I owe them my life.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Abrom!
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Abrom, thank God you're well."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,This is my brother.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,They were in the prison.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Beaten as I was, Abrom."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Abrom, I owe them my life."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,She would've been my wife.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"If we adopt the ways of the Nazis, we're as bad as the Nazis."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Stop, Nazis."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"After you've killed the last of us off, what do you do, turn the guns against yourselves?"
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Don't shoot.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Don't shoot, please."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Now, please forgive us, but we had to be absolutely certain."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,The Gestapo methods are frighteningly efficient.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"We must be very, very careful in order to survive here."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,We of the Underground don't know who our leaders are.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"That way, if we break under pressure, we can only betray a handful of our people."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,It's impossible.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Even if this were another time, it still would be impossible."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,He sees no one.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,No one but Melakon.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,He's under maximum security.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"There are many of us, both Ekosians and younger Zeons, who would gladly risk our lives to kill him."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,I'm afraid it will be a formal declaration of war against Zeon.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Their Final Solution.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Well it's a risk living at all the way things are going.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"If the Captain believes he has a chance, I'm willing to commit suicide with him."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,It's even more my fight than yours.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Sir, is this light better here?"
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"If you distract the guard long enough, I can get a machine gun."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"It's a small booth, I could shoot through the door."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"So, what have we accomplished?"
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,You should have let me shoot him.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,The cloakroom?
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,There's no reaction.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Whatever you gave him isn't working.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Many of my friends are aboard that ship, many of the Underground."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,(watching the door) Guards.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"For the second time in one day, Daras is a hero to the Fatherland."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Yes, let us make an example of this traitor once and for all."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"Chairman Eneg, this spy must be taken to Melakon."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Eneg is one of us.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,"A spy, Excellency."
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,For so long I've prayed for this.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,Now I'm sorry.
ISAK,Patterns Of Force,You've given us all a new chance.
YELLOW,Patterns Of Force,Zeon pig.
YELLOW,Patterns Of Force,"On your feet, pig."
YELLOW,Patterns Of Force,Hold.
YELLOW,Patterns Of Force,"Your hands above your head, Zeon."
YELLOW,Patterns Of Force,Higher.
YELLOW,Patterns Of Force,Keep your hands up so you don't touch anything Ekosian.
YELLOW,Patterns Of Force,You swine have defiled us for the last time.
YELLOW,Patterns Of Force,But that's now ended.
YELLOW,Patterns Of Force,Move!
MAN,Patterns Of Force,Attention.
MAN,Patterns Of Force,Attention.
MAN,Patterns Of Force,Attention.
MAN,Patterns Of Force,An announcement from Fuhrer Headquarters.
MAN,Patterns Of Force,"Today, the Fuhrer has ordered our glorious capital to be made Zeon-free."
MAN,Patterns Of Force,"Starting at dawn, our heroic troops have begun flushing out the Zeon monsters who've been poisoning our planet."
MAN,Patterns Of Force,The Fuhrer's headquarters reports repulsing an attack by Zeon spacecraft.
MAN,Patterns Of Force,Our missiles utterly destroyed the enemy.
MAN,Patterns Of Force,"At this patriotic demonstration, Deputy Fuhrer Melakon presented the Iron Cross, second class, to Daras, hero of the Fatherland."
MAN,Patterns Of Force,"(a blonde woman) Everywhere, preparations go forward toward the Final Decision, death to Zeon."
MAN,Patterns Of Force,Long live the Fatherland.
MAN,Patterns Of Force,Long live the Fuhrer.
CROWD,Patterns Of Force,Sieg heil!
CROWD,Patterns Of Force,Sieg heil!
SOLDIER,Patterns Of Force,"You, Zeons!"
SOLDIER,Patterns Of Force,What kind of monsters are the Zeons sending against us?
SOLDIER,Patterns Of Force,What do you mean?
OFFICER,Patterns Of Force,"Lieutenant, what have we here?"
OFFICER,Patterns Of Force,A Zeon?
OFFICER,Patterns Of Force,"With all Zeon pigs, Lieutenant."
OFFICER,Patterns Of Force,With pleasure.
OFFICER,Patterns Of Force,"Today we have a surprise planned for you, Zeon."
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Lieutenant!
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Have you forgotten how to salute?
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,(Spock salutes.)
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Your papers.
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"Good work, Lieutenant."
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Hail to the Fuhrer.
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Lieutenant?
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Better see a doctor.
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,You don't look well.
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Your colour.
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Lieutenant!
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Your helmet.
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Remove it.
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"Lieutenant, remove your helmet."
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Enough.
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,do you wish to speak now?
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Tell me your orders!
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,You were sent to kill our Fuhrer.
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Confess!
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Do you want some more persuasion?
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"Do not joke with me, Zeon pig."
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Who is this alien?
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Things might go easier if you tell me about him.
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,You'll be glad to talk to me before I'm through.
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"Ah, Chairman Eneg."
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"Your Excellency, I am honoured."
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"I've been interrogating these spies, captured in"
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Pig!
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,You're speaking to the Chairman of the Party.
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"Excellency, give me a few minutes with them."
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"I promise you, I'll have"
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"Yes, Excellency."
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"Excellency, the standing order is to interrogate and execute."
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"The interrogation is finished, therefore"
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"Excellency, the order"
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"Yes, Excellency."
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"(Eneg leaves) All right, pigs."
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,I shall keep my eye on the clock.
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,"When the hour is up, you will die most unpleasantly, I promise you!"
MAJOR,Patterns Of Force,Lock them up.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Major.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,I've had a full report.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,You are not from Zeon.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Where do you come from?
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,What is your business with the Fuhrer?
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,"That's enough, Major."
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,What were the weapons found on you?
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,What design?
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Our famous SS laboratories have been unable to discover how the weapons work.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,You've had a few minutes without result.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,The trouble with you SS is that you don't realise that punishment becomes ineffective after a certain point.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Men become insensitive.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Lock them up.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Let their pain argue with them.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Then I will question them.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Finished?
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,What have you learned?
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Hold them for an hour.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,"That is my order, Major."
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,I suggest you do not disobey it.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Search the building.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,I see.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,You were right to conceal him.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,There's a spy in this building with a secret transmitter.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,We're conducting a search.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Hail the Fuhrer.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Guards.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Pass them on my responsibility.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,"Wait, soldier."
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,There's been enough killing.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,Now we'll start to live the way the Fuhrer meant us to live.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,"Thank you, but go now."
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,We must do the rest.
ENEG,Patterns Of Force,"It is time to stop the bloodshed, to bury our dead."
DAVOD,Patterns Of Force,Who's with you?
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,"Isak, what is all this?"
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,Why were you in their prison?
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,The Fuhrer?
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,"Isak, Uletta is dead."
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,Shot down in the streets.
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,She lived for five hours while they walked past her and spat on her.
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,Our own people were unable to help her.
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,Now you ask me to help strangers.
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,This way.
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,I alone am responsible for what happens here.
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,"No, wait."
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,(gets up) No more.
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,You've proved they're on our side.
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,Yes.
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,"If we had taken you into our confidence, we could've betrayed all our people if you'd been Nazi spies."
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,"All right, leave us."
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,The Deputy Fuhrer.
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,He's taken over.
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,Who?
ABROM,Patterns Of Force,And what is your people?
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,Over there.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"Against the wall, all of you."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,Quiet.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"Hands in the air, Zeon swine."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,So you're the three who escaped from the Chancellery detention centre.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,What was your plan?
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,Speak.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,It's the last chance you'll get.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,Urgent?
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,I'll bet it is.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,Do you know what we do to responsible Zeons?
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,Now we finish the job.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,I'm an Ekosian fighting the terrible thing that's happened to my people.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,The decoration was for betraying my own father to the Party.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,It was my father's idea.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"You see, he used to be very close to the Fuhrer."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,Then he saw the changes and where they were leading.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,He turned against the Party.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,They imprisoned him.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,Melakon sentenced him to death.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"My father denounced me, making it appear like I'd betrayed him."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,He gave me a weapon to continue the fight with.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,You mean that the Fuhrer is an alien?
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"I grew up to admire him, later to hate and despise everything he stands for."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,But I always thought he was one of us.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,Now to hear that he's an alien sent here to destroy us
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,He makes a speech tonight from the Chancellery.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,All the top Party officials will be there.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,Of course.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,As a symbol of the proper attitude toward the Fatherland.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"Only the top, most trusted, officials will be allowed in."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,The country will watch on the viewscreens.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,It would be suicide.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"You, a Zeon?"
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,You expect to get into the Chancellery?
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,(marching into the building.)
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,The Fuhrer's special documentary corps.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"Smile, Corporal."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,He doesn't.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,They watch him on the big screen.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"There, at the end of the room."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,He broadcasts from the booth for security.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"There, at the end of the corridor."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,You're not going to try to get into the broadcast booth.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,We're documenting the men responsible for
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,Send for?
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,Isak just heard two security men.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"They picked up your broadcast, pin-pointed it within this building."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,They're starting to search.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,It's true.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,I only half-believed what you said.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,Chairman Eneg.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,The Fuhrer's speech.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"If they find us here, we'll all be killed."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,It's begun.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,It's finally begun.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,There's one chance left.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"If you'd use the weapons you have, you could destroy the fleet."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"Yes, but against those thousands are millions of innocent Zeon lives."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,You've got to choose the lesser of two evils.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,A rare prize.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,The Deputy Fuhrer can see this is no ordinary Zeon.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,The Deputy Fuhrer's an authority on the genetics of racial purity.
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,How would you classify this one?
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"Eneg and I will go on the air, offer a new way for our people."
DARAS,Patterns Of Force,"For all our people, both Zeons and Ekosians."
GUARD,Patterns Of Force,"You, what is your business here?"
GUARD,Patterns Of Force,It's Party Secretary Daras.
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Hail the Fuhrer.
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Hail the Fuhrer!
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Hail the Fuhrer!
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Hail the Fuhrer!
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Hail the Fuhrer!
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Hail the Fuhrer!
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Hail the Fuhrer!
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Death to Zeon!
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Death to Zeon!
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Death to Zeon!
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Death to Zeon!
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Hail victory!
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Hail victory!
ALL,Patterns Of Force,Hail victory!
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Ekosians.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,The job ahead is difficult.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,It requires courage and dedication.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,It requires faith.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,The Zeon colony has existed for nearly half a century.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,"If we fulfill our own greatness, that will all be ended."
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Working together
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Will at times be difficult.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,"To reach our goal, And we will reach that goal."
GILL,Patterns Of Force,must be decisive.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Every thought directed toward a goal.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,"This planet can become a paradise, if we are willing to pay the price."
GILL,Patterns Of Force,As each cell in the body works with discipline and harmony for the good of the entire being
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Planet fragmented.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Divided.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Took lesson from Earth history.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Most efficient state Earth ever knew.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Worked.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,At first it worked.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Then Melakon began take over.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Used the.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Gave me the drug.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,People.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,People of Ekos.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Hear me.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,We were betrayed by a self-seeking adventurer who has led us all to the very brink of disaster.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,I order the immediate recall of the space fleet.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,This attack must stop.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,All units are to return to base.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,"To Zeon I promise, this was not an aggression of Ekosian people."
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Only one evil man.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Melakon
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Is a traitor to his own people and all that we stand for.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,"To the Zeon people, I promise reparation and"

GILL,Patterns Of Force,The non-interference Directive is the only way.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,We must stop the slaughter.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,Even historians fail to learn from history.
GILL,Patterns Of Force,They repeat the same mistakes.

MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,Hail the Fuhrer!
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,"The Fuhrer has given us our orders, and we pledge him our lives in this sacred task."
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,Death to Zeon!
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,"But despite our best efforts, they remain like a cancer, eating away at our state."
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,"Ten minutes ago, on our Fuhrer's orders, our troops began their historic mission."
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,"In the cities, the eliminations have started."
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,"Within an hour, the Zeon blight will forever be removed from Ekos."
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,I now announce the glorious final solution.
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,Our entire solar system will forever be rid of the disease that was Zeon.
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,"Our space fleet is on its way toward Zeon, both manned and unmanned weapons."
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,This is the time of destiny.
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,Hail victory!
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,What is this?
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,"No, not a Zeon, definitely not."
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,Very difficult.
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,Note the sinister eyes and the malformed ears.
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,Definitely an inferior race.
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,"Note the low forehead, denoting stupidity."
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,The dull look of a trapped animal.
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,"You may take him now for interrogation, but I want the body saved for the Cultural Museum."
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,He'll make an interesting display.
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,Go to the booth.
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,See to the Fuhrer at once.
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,He's ill.
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,Turn off that camera.
MELAKON,Patterns Of Force,I suggest we leave and let our Fuhrer rest.

SULU,"The
Ultimate Computer","We're coming back on our original course, Captain."
SULU,"The

SULU,"The
Ultimate Computer","I already tried, sir."
SULU,"The
Ultimate Computer","Lieutenant Sulu here, sir."
SULU,"The
Ultimate Computer","Right away, sir."
SULU,"The
Ultimate Computer",You heard him.
SULU,"The

KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Not now, Leslie."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Lieutenant, contact the space station."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",All right.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Put them on.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Yes, Commodore, I'd like an explanation"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Spock.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Bob.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",I'll say.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Spock, this is"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","All right, Ensign."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",You can go.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Thank you very much.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Would you
mind telling me what this is all about?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",What's that?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",An entire attack force against my ship?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","That's Doctor Richard Daystrom's device, isn't it?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Tell me about
that."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",What has all this got to do with the Enterprise?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Why remove my crew?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",How much security does this gadget require?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Twenty?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",I can't run a starship with twenty crew.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",And what am I supposed to do?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",What do you want me to say?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5 is an honour, they tell me."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Well,
I'm honoured."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Where is he?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Scotty, where's Doctor Daystrom?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Doctor Daystrom, this is my first officer, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Well, by all means, do so."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Mister Scott, hook in the multitronic unit to the ship's main
power banks."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I wouldn't worry, Doctor."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Doctor McCoy has clearance throughout
the ship."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I'm curious, Doctor."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Why is it called M-5 and not M-1?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Total control?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",There are certain things men must do to remain men.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Your computer
would take that away."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","You'll have to prove that to me, Doctor."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I think that thing is wrong, and I don't know why."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",I don't mean that.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",I'm getting a Red Alert right here.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","(the back
of his head) That thing is dangerous."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",I feel.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","(hesitates) Only a fool
would stand in the way of progress, if this is progress."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","You have my
psychological profiles."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Am I afraid of losing my job to that computer?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Under human control.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Am I afraid of losing command to a computer?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Daystrom's right.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I
can do a lot of other things."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Am I afraid of losing the prestige and
the power that goes with being a starship captain?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Is that why I'm
fighting it?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Am I that petty?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",The M-5 computer is now disengaged.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","All it's done is make the required course changes and some simple
turns."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Mister Sulu and Mister Chekov could've done that with their eyes
closed."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","My orders are subject to my interpretation of how long the M-5 is
in control."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I'll run the ship in my own way, if you don't mind, Doctor
Daystrom."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",You seem to enjoy trusting yourself to the computer.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","If you don't mind, I'll make my own recommendations."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",M-5 is committed.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Standard orbit, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Oh, yes."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Report, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Check it out, Scotty."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","All right, my recommendations are as follows."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","We send down
general survey party, avoiding contact of all intelligent life on the
planet's surface."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The survey party will consist of myself, Doctor
McCoy, Astrobiologist Phillips, Geologist Rawlins and Science Officer
Spock."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Well, the only difference in reports and recommendations is the
landing party personnel."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",That's only a matter of judgment.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Why pick Carstairs instead of Rawlins?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Carstairs is an ensign, no
experience."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",This is his first tour of duty.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Rawlins is chief geologist.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Have you located the malfunction, Doctor?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Yes, that's correct."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Granted, it can work a thousand, a million times faster than the
human brain, but it can't make a value judgment."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",It hasn't intuition.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",It can't think.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",What is it?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",I'll be right up.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","What are you doing here, Bones?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Identification.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Put it on audio.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Acknowledge, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Then go to Red Alert.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Already sounded the Red Alert.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","All right, Mister Sulu, phasers
one one hundredth power."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","No damage potential, just enough to nudge
them."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Report on damage sustained in mock attack.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Evaluation of M-5 performance.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",It'll be necessary for the log.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Machine over man, Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",It was impressive.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","It might even be
practical."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Put it on visual.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Secure from general quarters.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I'm not interested in eating, Bones."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I've, I've never felt this way before."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",At odds with the ship.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I
sat there and watched my ship perform for a mass of circuits and
relays, and felt useless."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Unneeded.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",To Captain Dunsel.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Thank you, Doctor."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","(drinks) That's one of your better
prescriptions."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Do you know the one, 'All I ask is a tall ship'?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",20th century Earth. '
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",On my way.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Lieutenant, get Daystrom up here."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Disengaging M-5 unit.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Cut speed
to warp one."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Navigator, go to course one one three mark seven."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I want
that ship given a wide berth."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Scotty, reverse engines."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Slow us down.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",These controls are locked.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",We can't disengage the computer.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Daystrom, release that computer control!"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Disengage this computer now.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",But it shouldn't have destroyed anything.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","There might just as
easily have been a crew aboard that ship."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Bones.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Disengage the computer.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Lieutenant, contact Starfleet
Command."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Tell them we are breaking off M-5 tests and returning to the
space station."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Come along, Doctor Daystrom, M-5 is out of a job."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","All right, Daystrom, let's turn this thing
off."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Force field?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",You mean it's not going to let any of us turn it off.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","All right, Doctor, you built this thing."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","How
do you propose to turn it off?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Correct it after you release control of my ship.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",No!
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Stay here.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","All right, Scotty."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Turn it off.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",That wasn't a minor difficulty.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",That wasn't a robot.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","That thing
murdered one of my crewman and you tell me you can't turn it off?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",And how long will it be before all of us simply get in the way?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Spock, Scotty, come with me."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Report, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","We'll reach the rendezvous point for the war games within an
hour."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",We must regain control of the ship by then.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Scotty?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",How long?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Make it less.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","He's with the M-5 unit, watching it."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I think it surprised even
him."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Did you find anything?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Genius is an understatement.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","At the age of twenty four, he made
the duotronic breakthrough that won him the Nobel and Zee-Magnes
prizes."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Isn't that enough for one lifetime?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","All right, it's difficult."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",What's your point?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Genius doesn't work on an assembly line basis.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Did Einstein,
Kazanga, or Sitar of Vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on a
regular schedule?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","You can't simply say, today I will be brilliant."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","No
matter how long it took, he came out with multitronics."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",The M-5.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",And he won't let Spock near it.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","What are you saying, that he's
tampering with it, that he's making it act that way?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Why?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Now he's got you talking about that machine like a personality.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Good.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Get Daystrom.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",We're on our way.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Let's go.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","We're going to find out, Doctor."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","(At the foot of the Jefferies
tube)"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Spock?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Good, go ahead."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Daystrom, we're going to do our best."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Spock.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Bridge, this is Kirk."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Sulu?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",We've got helm and navigational control.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Turn us about.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Have
Mister Chekov plot a course back to the space station."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Go to the engineering station.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",While it was getting ready for what?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Spock?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Doctor Daystrom.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Doctor Daystrom, I want an answer right now."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I'm
tired of hearing about the M-5's new approach."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","What is it, exactly?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",What is it?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Well, Doctor?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Your new approach?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",What is it?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",The main attack force.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",The war games.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Correction, Bones."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Those four ships don't know it's M-5's game.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",And M-5 is going to destroy them.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Put it on.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Daystrom, does M-5 understand that this is only a drill?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Full strength?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",That's no miscalculation.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Estimate damage on Lexington, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",There's got to be a way of getting to the M-5.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","There's got to be
a way!"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Lieutenant?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",There's your murder charge.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Deliberate.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Calculated.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","It's killing
men and women."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Four starships, sixteen hundred men and women!"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Daystrom!
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Whose engrams?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",The computer tie-in.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",You spoke to it before.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",It knows you.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","You can save the M-5 if you talk to it and make it stop the
attack."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",You'd better pray that the M-5 listens to the sound of him.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",(quietly) Spock.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The M-5 is not responding to him like a
computer."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",It's talking to him.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",The M-5 must be destroyed.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Security, take him to Sickbay."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Take care of him, Doctor."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Battle status?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Go on.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",They've just signed their own death warrant.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5 will kill them
to survive."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Suppose it's still open to impression.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Suppose it absorbed the
regret Daystrom felt for the deaths it caused."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",The guilt.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The instrument of his death will not be the Enterprise if I can
help it."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5, tie-in."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",This is Captain Kirk.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",You will be under attack in a moment.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","You have already rendered one starship either dead or hopelessly
crippled."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Many lives were lost.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Why?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",There were many men aboard those ships.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",They were murdered.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Must
you survive by murder?"
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Why?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",But you have murdered.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Scan the starship Excalibur, which you
destroyed."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Is there life aboard?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Because you murdered it.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",What is the penalty for murder?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",And how will you pay for your acts of murder?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",M-5?
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Scotty, Spock, before it changes its mind."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Get down to
Engineering, pull out every hook up that makes M-5 run."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Pull out the
plug, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Lieutenant.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Intership communications.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",This is the captain speaking.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","In
approximately one minute, we'll be attacked by Federation starships."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The M-5 no longer controls the ship, but neither do we control it."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The
M-5 has left itself, and us, open for destruction."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","For whatever
satisfaction we may get from the knowledge, our nineteen lives will buy
the survival of over one thousand of our fellow starship crewmen."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",I need communications.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Then cut power.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Cut power.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Keep those shields down.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","That's exactly the situation I was hoping for when I forced the
M-5 to realise it had committed murder."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Daystrom felt such an act was against the laws of God and man.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",The computer that carried his engrams also believed it.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",I wasn't sure.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Any other commander would have simply followed
orders and destroyed us, but I knew Bob Wesley."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",I gambled on his humanity.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Bridge.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer",His logical selection was compassion.
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Mister Sulu, take us back to the space
station."
KIRK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Ahead, warp factor two."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, the station is calling us."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer",Bridge to Captain Kirk.
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Sensors are picking up a vessel paralleling our course, as
yet unidentified."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Priority message coming in, sir."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5 has acknowledged for us, sir."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, M-5 has"
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, message now coming in from Commodore Wesley."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain Kirk to the bridge, please."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer",Captain Kirk.
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, there's no response to any of our
signals, but M-5 has given us an autorelay."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain Kirk, Mister Spock, to the bridge, please."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Report
to the bridge, please."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Sir, sensors are picking up four Federation
starships."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer",M-5 is altering course to intercept.
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer",Enterprise to USS Lexington.
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Come in, Lexington."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Sir, I can't
raise them."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5 is blocking all frequencies, including automatic
distress."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Just a minute, sir."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, I'm getting audio signal from
the Lexington."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, M-5 is acknowledging."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, visual contact with Lexington."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer",I'm sorry.
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer",I can't override M-5 interference.
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, I'm getting the Lexington again."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Tapping in on their
message to Starfleet Command, sir."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, Lexington is receiving a message from Starfleet."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer",They
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"The
Ultimate Computer",Captain.
ENWRIGHT,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain Kirk, this is Commodore Enwright."
ENWRIGHT,"The
Ultimate Computer","The explanation is beaming aboard now, Captain."
ENWRIGHT,"The
Ultimate Computer","He may
already be in your transporter room."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Are you surprised?
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Mister Spock.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","You've had a singular honour conferred on you, Jim."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","You're
going to be the fox in the hunt."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",War games.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",I'll be commanding the attack force against you.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Have you heard of the M-5 multitronic unit?
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","How do you know so much about it, Commander?"
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","You've been chosen to test the M-5, Jim."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","There'll be a series
of routine research and contact problems for the M-5 to solve, plus
navigational manoeuvres and the war games problem."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","If the M-5 works
under actual conditions as well as it has under simulated tests, it
will mean a revolution in space technology as great as warp drive."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","When
your crew has been removed, the ship's engineering section will be
modified to contain the computer."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",They're not needed.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",None.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Doctor Daystrom will see to the installation himself and
he'll supervise the tests."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","When he's ready, you'll receive your orders
and proceed on the mission with a crew of twenty."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",The M-5 can.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","You've got a great job, Jim."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","All you have to do is sit back and
let the machine do the work."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Enterprise from Commodore Wesley aboard the USS Lexington.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",(Daystrom enters the Bridge) This is an unscheduled M-5 drill.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Repeat,
this is an M-5 drill."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Enterprise, acknowledge on this frequency."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","USS Enterprise from starships Lexington and
Excalibur."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Both ships report simulated hits in sufficient quantity and
location to justify awarding the surprise engagement to Enterprise."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Our compliments to the M-5 unit, and regards to
Captain Dunsel."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Wesley out.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Enterprise from USS Lexington.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",This is an M-5 drill.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Repeat.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",This is an M-5 drill.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Acknowledge.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Full phasers.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",What the devil is Kirk doing?
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Damage report, Lieutenant."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Helm, course one six four, mark three."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Enterprise.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Jim.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Have you gone mad?
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","What are
you trying to prove?"
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Break off the attack!
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Jim, we have fifty three
dead here, twelve on the Excalibur."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","If you can hear us, stop the
attack!"
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Jim, why don't you answer?"
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Jim!
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Answer!
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Come
in, Jim!"
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Jim, break off your attack!"
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",All ships damaged in unprovoked attack.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Excalibur Captain Harris and first officer dead.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Many casualties.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","We
have damage, but are still able to manoeuvre."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","The Enterprise refuses to
answer and is continuing attack."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","I still have an effective battle force
and believe the only way to stop the Enterprise is to destroy her."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Request permission to proceed.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Wesley, commanding attack force, out."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Acknowledged.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Lexington out.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Phasers on target.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",The Enterprise looks dead.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","I'm going to
take a chance he's not just laying a trap."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Wesley to attack force.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Break off attack.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Do not fire.
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","The Enterprise has dropped
her shields."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer","I repeat, hold attack."
WESLEY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Do not fire.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Commodore Wesley.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","How do you do, sir?"
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",The most ambitious computer complex ever created.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Its purpose is
to correlate all computer activity aboard a starship, to provide the
ultimate in vessel operation and control."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I hold an A-7 computer expert classification, Commodore."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I'm
well acquainted with Doctor Daystrom's theories and discoveries."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The
basic design of all our ship's computers are Doctor Daystrom's."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","We are attempting to prove it can run this ship more efficiently
than man."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The most unfortunate lack in current computer programming is
that there is nothing available to immediately replace the starship
surgeon."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I am honoured, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Fascinating, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","This computer has a potential beyond
anything you've ever done."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Even your breakthrough in duotronics did not
have the promise of this."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The M-5 has been perfected, Commander."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Its potential is a fact.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","If I can be of assistance, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",M-5 has performed admirably so far.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, I am forced to agree with Doctor Daystrom."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","With the
course information plotted into it, his computer could have brought us
here as easily as the navigator."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","In fact, it might have been a further
demonstration of M-5's capability."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Enjoy, Captain?"
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",No.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I'm merely gratified to see Doctor
Daystrom's new unit execute everything required of it in such a highly
efficient manner."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",M-5 is another distinguished triumph for his career.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The planet is class M, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere
suitable for human life support."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Two major land masses, a number of
islands, life form readings."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","(handing over a computer disc) M-5's readout, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, the computer does not judge."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","It makes logical
selections."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I am not familiar with these instruments, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","You are using
an entirely new type of control mechanism."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","However, it appears to me
this unit is drawing more power than before."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Doctor, this unit is not a human body."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The computer can process
information, but only the information which is put into it."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, sensors report two contacts now."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","One on the port bow,
one on the stern."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Distance, two hundred
thousand kilometres and closing."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",We are not scheduled for war games in this area.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","This may be a
surprise attack as a problem for the M-5."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Phaser hit on port deflector four, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Attacking vessels are moving off.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Minor hit on deflector screen four.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",No appreciable damage.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The ship reacted more rapidly than human control could have
manoeuvred her."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Tactics, deployment of weapons, all indicate an immense
sophistication in computer control."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Practical, Captain?"
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Perhaps.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",But not desirable.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Computers make
excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under
them."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain the starship also runs on loyalty to one man, and nothing
can replace it, or him."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Dunsel, Doctor, is a term used by midshipmen at Starfleet
Academy."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",It refers to a part which serves no useful purpose.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Another contact, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","A large, slow-moving vessel."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Unidentified.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",This is not a drill.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5 has identified her, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",The Woden.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Listed in Starfleet
Registry as an old-style ore freighter converted to automation."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","No
crew."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Coming into visual range.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","No effect on any of the M-5 controls, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, photon torpedoes locking on target."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Full power.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","All systems report normal, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I would say, Captain, that M-5 is not only capable of taking
care of this ship, it is also capable of taking care of itself."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5 appears drawing power directly from the warp engines,
tapping the matter-antimatter reserves."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The multitronic unit is drawing more and more power directly
from the warp engines."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The computer now controls all helm, navigation,
and engineering functions."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",There is one possibility.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The automatic helm navigation circuit
relays might be disrupted from engineering level three."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Most illogical.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Of all people, he should have known how the
computer would perform."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Of course, the M-5 itself has not behaved
logically."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",No.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",But it is interesting.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Good.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Spock to Captain Kirk.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","We are ready, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Mister Scott is ready to apply the circuit disrupter.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","As he does
so, I shall trip the manual override into control."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Manual override is in control, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Mister Chekov.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Examine the H two seven nine elements,
also the G nine five systems."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Thank you, Ensign."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","It appears, Captain, we've been doing
what used to be called pursuing a wild goose."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5 has rerouted helm and
navigational controls, bypassing this primary system."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I believe that when M-5 discovered our tampering, it rerouted
the controls, leaving this one active by simply sending through an
electronic impulse at regular intervals."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",I do not know.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",It is not performing in a logical manner.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I do not mean to offend, sir, but it behaves with an almost
human pattern."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Attack force closing rapidly, breaking formation, attacking at
will."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Hit on the Lexington.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Hit in engineering section.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Possible damage to her impulse
engines."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",She's still maneuverable on warp drive.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The Excalibur, a direct hit."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Lexington hit again.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Probably true, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","It works faster, thinks faster than we
do."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","It is a human mind amplified by the instantaneous relays possible
in a computer."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Doctor Daystrom, you impressed human engrams on the M-5
circuits."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Then perhaps you could talk to the unit.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5 has no reason to
believe you would harm it."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I am most impressed with the technology, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Doctor
Daystrom has created a mirror image of his mind."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Every living thing wants to survive, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Daystrom must have
impressed that instinctive reaction upon the computer."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Commodore Wesley is a dedicated commander.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I should regret
serving aboard the instrument of his death."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, attack force almost within phaser range."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",M-5 is leaving itself open to attack.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The machine is committing
suicide to atone for the sin of murder."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer",Spock to Captain.
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The force field is gone, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5 is
neutralised."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I would say his multitronic unit is in approximately the same
condition."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, why did you feel the attacking ships would not fire
when they saw the Enterprise apparently vulnerable?"
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","Logically, that is
the sort of trap M-5 should have set."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","No, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I simply maintain that computers are more efficient
than human beings, not better."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","I presume your question is meant to offer me a choice between
machines and human beings, and I believe I have already answered that
question."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","It would be most interesting to impress your memory engrams on a
computer, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Ultimate Computer","The resulting torrential flood of illogic would be
most entertaining."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","I don't like it, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","A vessel this size
cannot be run by one computer."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Maybe you're trying to prove that, Spock, but don't count me in
on it."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Very funny.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","If it could, they wouldn't have
to replace me."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","I'd resign because everybody else aboard would be
nothing but circuits and memory banks."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","You know the type, Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Jim,
you haven't had much to say about this."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Frankly, the only fact that I'm concerned about is if this thing
doesn't work, there are not enough men aboard to run the ship."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","That's
begging for trouble."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Doctor Leonard McCoy, senior medical officer."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Is it supposed to do that?
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Did you see the love light in Spock's eyes?
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",The right computer finally came along.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","What's the matter, Jim?"
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","I think it's wrong, too, replacing men with mindless machines."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Jim, we've all seen the advances of mechanisation."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","After all,
Daystrom did design the computers that run this ship."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","We're all sorry for the other guy when he loses his job to a
machine."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","When it comes to your job, that's different."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","And it always
will be different."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Jim, if you have the awareness to ask yourself that question,
you don't need me to answer it for you."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Why don't you ask James T.
Kirk?"
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",He's a pretty honest guy.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","All the Sickbay systems are shut down until such time as the M-5
is informed there are patients to be cared for."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Dunsel?
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Who the blazes is Captain Dunsel?
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","(everyone else knows)
What does it mean, Jim?"
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",(Kirk leaves the bridge) Spock?
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","What does it
mean?"
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",This isn't chicken soup.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","I may be just a ship's doctor, but I
make a Finagle's Folly that's known from here to Orion."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","I strongly
prescribe it, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","To James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Simple but effective.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",It's a line from a poem.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","A very old poem, isn't it?"
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Jim.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Fantastic machine, the M-5."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",No off switch.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Normal?
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",That thing's trying to tell us nothing has happened.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",There certainly does.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Your brilliant young computer just
destroyed an ore freighter."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","In fact it went out of its way to destroy
an ore freighter!"
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",In which case you'd be guilty of murder.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",And communications and fire control.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",I'll get the man responsible in the first place.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Where is
Daystrom?"
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Please, Spock, do me a favour and don't say it's fascinating."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Have you found a solution, a way to shut
that thing off?"
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Learning to kill.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",That thing is a danger to us all.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Now find some way to shut it
off."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",The biographical tape of Richard Daystrom.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Not much, aside from the fact he's a genius."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","In his early twenties, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","That's over a quarter of a century
ago."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Maybe that's the trouble.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Where do you go from up?
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","You publish
articles, you give lectures, then spend your life trying to recapture
past glory."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","The M-1 through M-4, remember?"
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Not entirely successful.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","That's
the way Daystrom put it."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Right.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","The government bought it, then Daystrom had to make it
work."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",And he did.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","But according to Spock, it works illogically."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Jim, if a man had a child who'd gone antisocial, killed perhaps,
he'd still tend to protect that child."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",I'm afraid that's the way he thinks about it.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Decoyed.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",It wanted us to waste our time.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",But M-5 doesn't know it's a game.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","If that thing cuts loose against unshielded ships, we're in"
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Of course.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","I don't like the sound of him, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Jim, he's on the edge of a nervous breakdown, if not insanity."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","He'll have to be committed to a total
rehabilitation centre."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Right now he's under sedation and heavy
restraints."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",Compassion.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer",That's the one thing no machine ever had.
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Maybe it's
the one thing that keeps men ahead of them."
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","Care to debate that, Spock?"
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","But tell me, which do you prefer to have around?"
MCCOY,"The
Ultimate Computer","I was just trying to make conversation, Spock."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer",He was here.
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer",(spots him behind a console) Doctor.
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","(sullenly) Aye, aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer",Mister Harper.
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, power shutdowns on deck four."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","Lights, environmental
control."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer",The power's gone off on deck five.
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, I've located the source of the power shutdowns."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","It's
the M-5 unit, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer",That thing's turning off systems all over the ship.
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","Reverse thrusts will not engage, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","Manual override isn't
working either."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, I suggest we disconnect it at the source."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer",So now it has virtually unlimited power.
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, what'll we do?"
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer",Aye.
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","I can take them out and cut in the manual override from
there."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","If Mister Spock helps me, maybe an hour."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","Aye, that's got it, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","That's it, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer",But it was active.
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer",I'd stake all that I know that it was.
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer",System's coming back.
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer","I can give you power for the shields, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer",That'll take longer.
SCOTT,"The
Ultimate Computer",Sir!
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",(an imposing black man) Yes?
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Ah, you'd be Captain Kirk."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",Thank you.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",Thank you very much.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, I've finished my
tests on the M-5, and it must be hooked into your main power plants in
order to be operative."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Your engineer there wouldn't allow us the power necessary
without your orders."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Now, who is this?"
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Well, I'm sorry, but this is a security area."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","No, no, no."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",Thank you.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",I can manage.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","There's nothing wrong,
Captain."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",Just a few minor settling-in adjustments to make.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","As you can
see, all is in order now."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Well, you see, the multitronic units one through four were
not entirely successful."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",This one is.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5 is ready to take control of
the ship."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","That is what it was designed for, Captain."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",There are other things a man like you might do.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Or perhaps
you object to the possible loss of prestige and ceremony accorded a
starship captain."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",A computer can do your job and without all that.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","That is what we're here for, isn't it, Captain?"
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Yes, but you see, the idea is they didn't have to do it."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","And
you'll find it won't be necessary for you to regain control of the unit
after it's completed each manoeuvre."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Captain, your orders at this point are not open to
interpretation."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","You must commit the M-5 to handle its approach,
the orbit, and then to analyse data regarding landing party
recommendations."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Well, if you feel you need the exercise, go on, Captain."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Play M-5's recommendations, won't you, Mister Spock?"
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Judgment, Captain?"
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Aren't you really more interested in why M-5 did not select
you and Doctor McCoy?"
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Well, let's find out anyway."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",M-5 tie-in.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",Explanation for landing party recommendation.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Why were the Captain and the Chief Medical Officer not
included in recommendation?"
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","As I suspected, it is not a malfunction."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5 was merely
shutting down power to areas of the ship that do not require it."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",And currently unoccupied.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",Quite right.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","As the unit is called upon to do more work, it
pulls more power to enable it to do what is required of it, just as the
human body draws more energy to run than to stand still."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",Can't you understand?
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","The multitronic unit is a revolution in
computer science."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","I designed the duotronic elements used in your ship
right now, and I know they are as archaic as dinosaurs compared to the
M-5."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",A whole new approach.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Rather impressive display for a machine, wouldn't you say,
Captain?"
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","(enters) Captain, what is it?"
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",There appears to be some defect in the control panel.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",Fortunately it was only a robot ship.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","It's not my doing, Kirk."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",This exercise is a trial for M-5.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",A shakedown.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","We must expect
minor difficulties, but I assure you they can be corrected."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",I can't.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",Give me a few moments with it.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",It wasn't a deliberate act.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5's analysis told it it needed
a new power source."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",The ensign simply got in the way.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",You don't shut a child off when it makes a mistake.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","M-5 is
growing, learning."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",To defend itself.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",It's quite a different thing.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","When a child
is taught, it's programmed with simple instructions, and at some point,
if its mind develops properly, it exceeds the sum of what it was
taught, thinks independently."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",You can't understand.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","You're frightened because you can't
understand it."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",I'm going to show you.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",I'm going to show all of you.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","It
takes four hundred thirty people to man a starship."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","With this, you
don't need anyone."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","One machine can do all those things they send men
out to do now."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",Men no longer need die in space or on some alien world.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Men can live and go on to achieve greater things than fact-finding and
dying for galactic space, which is neither ours to give or to take."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",They can't understand.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","We don't want to destroy life, we want to save
it."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","What is it, Captain?"
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",No!
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","No, no, no."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",You can't take control from the M-5.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",You can't do it.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Now let me work with it for a while, please."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",Please.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Please, please!"
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","Yes, quite right, Mister Spock."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","You see, one of the arguments
against computers controlling ships was that they couldn't think like
men."
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer",Exactly.
DAYSTROM,"The
Ultimate Computer","I've developed a method of impressing human engrams
upon the computer circuits."
DAYSTROM,"The

know."
DAYSTROM,"The

DAYSTROM,"The

DAYSTROM,"The

SULU,The Omega Glory,"Approaching planet Omega Four, sir."
SULU,The Omega Glory,Object ahead.
SULU,The Omega Glory,"Another vessel in planet orbit, Captain."
SULU,The Omega Glory,"It's the USS Exeter, sir."
SULU,The Omega Glory,"The sensors indicate no damage to the vessel, Captain."
SULU,The Omega Glory,"Sir, this is Lieutenant Sulu in temporary command of the Enterprise."
SULU,The Omega Glory,Our whole medical staff will volunteer to beam down
SULU,The Omega Glory,Repeat your message.
SULU,The Omega Glory,"Come in, landing party."
SULU,The Omega Glory,Repeat your message.
SULU,The Omega Glory,"I understand, sir."
SULU,The Omega Glory,"When he regains consciousness, assure him that we have no problems here."
SULU,The Omega Glory,"Captain, this is Sulu."
SULU,The Omega Glory,"We read you, but surely you know that can't be done"
SULU,The Omega Glory,Without verification.
SULU,The Omega Glory,"Captain, we have volunteers standing by to beam down."
SULU,The Omega Glory,What is your situation?
SULU,The Omega Glory,"Sir, we picked up communicator signals, but"
SULU,The Omega Glory,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Lieutenant, sound alert."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Long range sensor scan, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Try to contact her, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,The Exeter.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,she was patrolling in this area six months ago.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,I hadn't heard of any trouble.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,I see.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Magnification factor three, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Hold our position out here, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Lieutenant, have Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy, and Lieutenant Galloway report to the transporter room."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,We'll board and investigate.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Phasers on heavy stun.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Energise.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Just their uniforms left.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Exactly.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,When what?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,This is Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Is anyone on board?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"If there is, and you can hear me, please respond by intercom to the engineering section."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Is there anyone on board?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,What about the shuttlecraft?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Doctor McCoy and I are going to the Bridge.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Meet us there.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Spock, play the last log tape."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Maybe they had time to record what happened to them.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,What do you mean?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Prepare to beam down to the planet surface fast.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,That's Ron Tracey.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Ron.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"You were left alone down here, Ron."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,What happened?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Yes, I know."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,We saw it.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"I don't think we're going to have time to isolate it, Bones."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Are you all right?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Spock, do you see any hope that these Yangs can be reasoned with?"
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"A truce, a parley, a"
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Phaser power packs.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,The fool.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,The fool.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Starfleet should be made aware.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Sulu!
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Captain Ronald Tracey, as per Starfleet Command, regulation seven, paragraph four"
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Which is, why?"
KIRK,The Omega Glory,McCoy could verify all that.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,For sale by
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Yes, I suppose they would."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,It's a very interesting proposition.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Let me think it over.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"I don't think we have the right or the wisdom to interfere, however a planet is evolving."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Don't they ever rest?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Thank you, Spock."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"(grabs the woman to use her as a shield, but she bites his hand.)"
KIRK,The Omega Glory,At least tell me why you want to kill me.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"No point in repeating that it's illogical, Spock."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,I'm quite aware of it.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Pity you can't teach me that.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,I can't even get at it.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,He'd be on me in a moment.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"(the woman is awake again) Keep talking, Spock."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Don't let me doze off.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,That's a very interesting theory.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"The yellow civilisation is almost destroyed, the white civilisation is destroyed."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Keep working on the window if we're ever going to regain our freedom.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Spock.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Well, well, well."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"It is our worship word, too."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Am I not now a prisoner of the Kohms as you are?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Why did you not speak until now?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Spock, we'll have you out in a minute."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Spock.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,How long?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Seven hours and eight.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Spock.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Keys.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,(on a table) I'll have you out in a minute.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Good morning.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Good.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Did you find out anything?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"There is a disease here, something that affected the Exeter landing party and us."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Then we can leave any time we want to.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Tracey is of the opinion these immunising agents can become a fountain of youth.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"There are people here over a thousand years old, Bones."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Then anything you develop here as a result of all this is useless.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,All that bloodshed for nothing.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"That'll be sufficient, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,We can beam up at any time.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Any of us.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,There's no serum!
KIRK,The Omega Glory,There are no miracles!
KIRK,The Omega Glory,There's no immortality here!
KIRK,The Omega Glory,All this is for nothing!
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Do what you can for him, Doctor."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Where is everybody?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"We can beam up, Tracey."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,All of us.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,All right.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,(takes the communicator) Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Yes, quite all right."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"I'd like ten phasers beamed down with three extra power packs, please."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Have you got that?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Enterprise, do you read me?"
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Not even if we're in danger, Mister Sulu?"
KIRK,The Omega Glory,The situation is not immediately dangerous.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Have the volunteers stand by.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Spock?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"If my ancestors were forced out of the cities into the deserts, the hills"
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Living like the Indians, and finally even looking like the American Indian."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,American.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Yangs?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Yanks?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Spock, Yankees!"
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"But if it were true, all these generations of Yanks fighting to regain their land."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"And to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,In my land we have a tribe like you.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Up there.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,One of those points of light that you see at night.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,You're confusing the stars with heaven.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,We're not gods!
KIRK,The Omega Glory,We're not evil ones.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"We're men, like yourselves."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,(Cloud William kisses a large Holy Bible then opens it at Haggai - with a picture of a devil who looks very like Spock.)
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Are your faces alike?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Can you tell from them which of you is good and which of you is evil?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Those words are familiar.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Wait a moment.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"No, wait!"
KIRK,The Omega Glory,There's a better way.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Does not your sacred book promise that good is stronger than evil?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"We'll discuss that later, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Leslie, free Doctor McCoy and Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Put Captain Tracey under arrest.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Now, Cloud William."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"I did not recognise those words, you said them so badly, Without meaning."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,This was not written for chiefs.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,(general consternation) Hear me!
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Hear this!
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Among my people, we carry many such words as this from many lands, many worlds."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Many are equally good and are as well respected, but wherever we have gone, no words have said this thing of importance in quite this way."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Look at these three words written larger than the rest, with a special pride never written before or since."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Tall words proudly saying We the People.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"That which you call Ee'd Plebnista was not written for the chiefs or the kings or the warriors or the rich and powerful, but for all the people!"
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Down the centuries, you have slurred the meaning of the words, 'We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution.'"
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"These words and the words that follow were not written only for the Yangs, but for the Kohms as well!"
KIRK,The Omega Glory,They must apply to everyone or they mean nothing!
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Do you understand?
KIRK,The Omega Glory,We merely showed them the meaning of what they were fighting for.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,Liberty and freedom have to be more than just words.
KIRK,The Omega Glory,"Gentlemen, the fighting is over here."
KIRK,The Omega Glory,I suggest we leave them to discover their history and their liberty.
UHURA,The Omega Glory,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,The Omega Glory,"All decks report ready, sir."
UHURA,The Omega Glory,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,The Omega Glory,"Receiving no response to our signal, sir."
UHURA,The Omega Glory,"We'll beam it down shortly, Doctor."
UHURA,The Omega Glory,Enterprise out.
UHURA,The Omega Glory,Enterprise bridge.
UHURA,The Omega Glory,Lieutenant Uhura.
UHURA,The Omega Glory,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,The Omega Glory,Captain Kirk informed us earlier you had survived.
UHURA,The Omega Glory,"Captain, are you all right now?"
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"We're locked onto the Exeter's engineering section, Captain."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Captain.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,As if they were in them when
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Lieutenant Galloway and I are checking out the lower levels.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,There seems to be no one aboard.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Only uniforms.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Fascinating.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Aye, sir."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"I have their surgeon's log, Captain."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Their last log entry, Captain, on screen."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Interesting that the villagers know about phasers.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"A Yang lance, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Bruised only.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,We were approximately one hundred metres from the village when five of the savages ambushed us.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,We managed to escape without firing.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Captain Tracey is being quite factual in several statements.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"One, the Yangs are totally contemptuous of death."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,They seem incredibly vicious.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Two, he is also being factual in that the Yangs are massing for an attack."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,There are signs of thousands of them in the foothills beyond.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"However, he was less than truthful in one very important matter."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Captain Tracey's reserve belt packs.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Empty.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Found among the remains of several hundred Yang bodies.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"A smaller attack on this village a week ago, driven off by Captain Tracey with his phaser."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,I have found villagers who will corroborate it.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Regulations are quite harsh, but they're also quite clear, Captain."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"If you do not act, you will be considered equally guilty."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,I agree that formal charges have little meaning now.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"However, you must at least confiscate his phaser."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Not that I have observed, Captain."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Of course, should they wish to do so, one could always rest while the other keeps you occupied."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Good, Captain."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Try to reason with them.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Keep trying, Captain."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Their behaviour is highly illogical.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"I have tried, Captain."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Captain, I have managed to loosen this grill somewhat."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,If the mortar on yours is as old.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Captain Tracey mentioned there was once a considerable civilisation here.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,The only reasonable explanation would be a war.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Nuclear devastation or a bacteriological holocaust.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Yes, I heard, Captain."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Captain?
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Captain?
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Captain, are you able to respond?"
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Seven hours and eight minutes, Captain."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"We can contact the ship in a few moments, Captain, if I can cross-circuit this unit."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,War created an imbalance and nature counterbalanced it.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Ready, Captain."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Quite crude.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"Voice communication will not be possible, but we can signal the ship."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"I'm weak, Captain, but not in difficulty."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"My need for attention is vital, Doctor, but our need for departure is even more immediate."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Yes.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"I see, Captain."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"They would've learned to wear skins, adopted stoic mannerisms, learned the bow and the lance."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Kohms?
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,Communists?
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"The parallel is almost too close, Captain."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"It would mean they fought the war your Earth avoided, and in this case, the Asiatics won and took over this planet."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"I am open to suggestions, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,I'm making a suggestion.
SPOCK,The Omega Glory,"There's no question about his guilt, Captain, but does our involvement here also constitute a violation of the Prime Directive?"
GALLOWAY,The Omega Glory,"Galloway on the hangar deck, sir."
GALLOWAY,The Omega Glory,All four of the craft are still here.
GALLOWAY,The Omega Glory,"If they left, they didn't leave that way."
GALLOWAY,The Omega Glory,"The helm was left on automatic, sir."
GALLOWAY,The Omega Glory,"No, Captain."
GALLOWAY,The Omega Glory,They're too wild.
GALLOWAY,The Omega Glory,They act almost insane.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Jim, the analysis of this so far is potassium thirty five percent, carbon eighteen percent, phosphorous one point zero, calcium one point five."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Jim, the crew didn't leave."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,They're still here.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,These white crystals.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"That's what's left of the human body when you take the water away, which makes up ninety six percent of our bodies."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Without water, we're all just three or four pounds of chemicals."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,Something crystallised them down to this.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,: Lucky we found that log.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,If we'd gone back to the Enterprise.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,Tell the lab the final reading on our tissue is Y three X point zero zero four.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,And I could use a second blood analyser unit.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Our tissues definitely show a massive infection, Jim, but something is immunising us down here, thank heavens, or we'd have been dead hours ago."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"The problem is, it could be anything Some spores or pollen in the air, some chemical."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Just finding it could take months, maybe even years."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,And I've only got one lead.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,The infection resembles one developed by Earth during their bacteriological warfare experiments in the 1990s.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,Hard to believe we were once foolish enough to play around with that.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,Now wait a minute.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"He lost his ship and his crew, and he found himself the only thing standing between an entire village of peaceful people."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Without a serum, we're trapped here with the villagers."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,Now why destroy what's left of the man by arresting him?
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Oh, thank you."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,Thank you very much.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Good morning, Jim."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,Yes.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,I'm convinced that once there was a frightening biological war that existed here.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,The virus still exists.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Then over the years, nature built up these natural immunising agents in the food, the water, and the soil."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,That's right.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"These immunising agents take time, and that's the real tragedy."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Had the Exeter landing party stayed here just a few hours longer, they never would have died."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Survival of the fittest, because their ancestors who survived had to have a superior resistance."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,Then they built up these powerful protective antibodies in the blood during the wars.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Now, if you want to destroy a civilisation or a whole world, your descendants might develop a longer life, but I hardly think it's worth it."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,Who knows?
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"It might eventually cure the common cold, but lengthen lives?"
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,Poppycock.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,I can do more for you if you just eat right and exercise regularly.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"He'll live, but I'll have to get him to better facilities than this."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,He's fully immunised now.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,We all are.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Leave medicine to medical men, Captain."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,You found no fountain of youth here.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,People live longer here now because it's natural for them to.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,He must have attention soon.
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"You're a romantic, Jim."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,His heart is different!
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,The internal organs of a Vulcan are
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Spock, I've found that evil usually triumphs unless good is very, very careful."
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,"Spock, we've got to do something!"
MCCOY,The Omega Glory,What are you doing?
DOCTOR,The Omega Glory,"If you've come aboard this ship, you're dead men."
DOCTOR,The Omega Glory,Don't go back to your own ship.
DOCTOR,The Omega Glory,You have one chance.
DOCTOR,The Omega Glory,Get down there.
DOCTOR,The Omega Glory,Get down there fast.
DOCTOR,The Omega Glory,Captain Tracey is (screams and falls out of view.)
VOICE,The Omega Glory,Oi!
VOICE,The Omega Glory,O1!
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Put the axe away, Liyang."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,I knew someone would come looking for us.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"I'm just sorry it had to be you, Jim."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,I'm glad your arrival stopped this.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"No more of this, Wu."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Lock up the savages.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,I said lock up the savages.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,The prisoners are called Yangs.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Impossible even to communicate with.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Hordes of them out there.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,They'll attack anything that moves.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Our medi-scanners revealed this planet as perfectly harmless.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"The villagers, the Kohms here, were friendly enough once they got over the shock of my white skin."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"As you've seen, we resemble the Yangs, the savages."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,My landing party transported back to the ship.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,I stayed down here to arrange for the planet survey with the village elders.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"The next thing I knew, the ship was calling me."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,The landing party had taken an unknown disease back.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"My crew, Jim."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,My entire crew.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Gone.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,And I'm just as infected as they were.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,As you are.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,But I stayed alive because I stayed down here.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,There's some natural immunisation that protects everyone on the planet surface.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,I don't know what it is.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"You'd be dying by now, along with the rest of the Enterprise crew."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,You'll stay alive only as long as you stay here.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,None of us will ever leave this planet.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"I'll be sending the next message, Jim."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Enterprise, come in."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Captain Tracey of the Exeter.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,I'm afraid I have some bad news.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Your captain and landing party must have beamed down too late for full immunisation.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"They've been found unconscious, but I'm doing everything I can for them now."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"There's no point in risking more lives, Lieutenant."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Since I've acquired some immunity perhaps the others
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"At their next word, kill him."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"I'm sorry, Lieutenant."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Your captain's feverish, quite delirious."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"I'll contact you later, let you know of any future needs."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Landing party out.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"That's enough of that, Captain."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Leave us.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"I must now consider myself under arrest, unless in the presence of the most senior fellow officers presently available, I give satisfactory answer to those charges which you now bring."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Et cetera, et cetera."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Those were the first words duty required you to say to me, and you said them."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,You're covered.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Now, suppose we go on to the next subject."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Good.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Direct, succinct."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Answer.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,No native to this planet has ever had any trace of any kind of disease.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"How long would a man live if all disease were erased, Jim?"
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Wu.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,(Wu enters) Tell Captain Kirk your age.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Their year of the red bird comes once every eleven years, which he's seen forty two times."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Multiply it.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Wu is four hundred and sixty two years old.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,His father is well over a thousand.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Interested, Jim?"
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,He will if you order it.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,We must have a doctor researching this.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Are you grasping all it means?
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"This immunising agent here, once we've found it, is a fountain of youth."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Virtual immortality, or as much as any man will ever want."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,(to Wu) Out.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,(Wu leaves) By those who own the serum.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,McCoy will eventually isolate it.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Meanwhile, you inform your ship your situation's impossible."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Order them away.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"When we're ready, we'll bargain for a whole fleet of ships to pick us up."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,And they'll do it.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,We've got to stay alive.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Let the Yangs kill us and destroy what we have to offer and we'll have committed a crime against all humanity.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"I'd say that's slightly more important than the Prime Directive, wouldn't you, Jim?"
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Guards.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Take the doctor back to his workplace.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,The pointed-eared one stays.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"And Wu, tell your men we'll be leaving soon."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,We'll be in ambush for the Yangs.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,With many fire boxes this time.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"What do you think of that, Jim?"
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Animals who happen to look like us.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,You still think the Prime Directive's for this planet?
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Well, if logic won't work, perhaps this will."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Put him in there.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,No messages.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Kirk, the savage in the cell with you."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Did you set him free?
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"You sent him, Kirk."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,You sent him to warn the tribes!
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,The Yangs must've been warned.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,They sacrificed hundreds just to draw us out in the open.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"And then they came, and they came."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"We drained four of our phasers, and they still came."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,We killed thousands and they still came.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Impossible!
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,You can't carry the disease up to the ship with you.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,You've isolated the serum?
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Explain it to him, Doctor."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Outside.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Or I'll burn down both your friends now.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Dead or in hiding.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Now let's see how eager you are to die.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Call your ship.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"I need your help, Kirk."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,They're going to attack the village.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,My phaser's almost drained.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"We need new, fresh ones."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"You're not just going to stand there and let them kill you, are you?"
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"If I put a weapon in your hand you'll fight, won't you?"
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,I want five phasers.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"No, ten."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,With three extra power packs each.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Say again.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"You have a well-trained bridge crew, Captain."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,My compliments.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"They can be handled, Jim."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Together it'll be easy.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"I caution you, gentlemen, don't fight me here."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,I'll win.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Or at worst, I'll drag you down with me."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,He was cast out!
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Don't you recognise the Evil One?
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Who else would trick you with your own sacred words?
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Let your God strike me dead if I lie.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"But he won't, because I speak for him."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,You tried to kill me.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Would a man know your holy words?
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Would a man use them to trick you?
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,See his servant?
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"His face, his eyes, his ears?"
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Do the Yang legends describe this servant of the evil one?
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,You command him.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Everyone's seen that.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,You want more proof?
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,He has no heart.
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"He fears to speak them, for indeed his tongue would burn with fire."
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,Force him!
TRACEY,The Omega Glory,"Kill his servant unless he speaks, so you may see if the words burn him."
WU,The Omega Glory,They carry fire boxes.
WU,The Omega Glory,Age?
WU,The Omega Glory,I have seen forty two years of the red bird.
WU,The Omega Glory,My eldest brother
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,"(The male Yang, with a very deep voice.)"
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,Freedom?
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,Freedom?
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,That is a worship word.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,Yang worship.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,You will not speak it.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,You live with the Kohms.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,You spoke to Kohms.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,They are only for killing.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,That which is ours is ours again.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,It will never be taken from us again.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,"I am Cloud William, chief."
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,Also son of chief.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,"Guardian of the holies, speaker of the holy words, leader of warriors."
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,"Many have died, but this is the last of the Kohm places."
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,What is ours is ours again.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,Aypledgli ianectu flaggen tupep kile for stahn
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,You know many of our high-worship words.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,How?
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,Where is your tribe?
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,Yet you killed many Yangs.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,Bring him.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,He has no heart.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,But which?
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,"If we should kill the good, evil would be among us."
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,Greatest of holies.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,"Chiefs and sons of chiefs may speak the words, but the Evil One's tongue would surely turn to fire."
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,I will begin.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,You shall finish.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,Ee'dplebnista norkohn forkohn perfectunun.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,The fight is done when one is dead.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,Hoola!
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,Kill him.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,It is written.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,Good must destroy evil.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,You are a great God servant.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,We are your slaves.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,"When you would not say the holy words, of the Ee'd Plebnista, I doubted you."
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,The Kohms?
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,"I do not fully understand, one named Kirk."
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,But the holy words will be obeyed.
CLOUD,The Omega Glory,I swear it.
ELDER,The Omega Glory,He spoke the holy word.
ELDER,The Omega Glory,Why are you here?
ELDER,The Omega Glory,Were you cast out?
ELDER,The Omega Glory,One of them lies.
ELDER,The Omega Glory,(reaching for a document) There is a way.
ELDER,The Omega Glory,It is written.
ELDER,The Omega Glory,No!
ELDER,The Omega Glory,No!
ELDER,The Omega Glory,Only the eyes of a chief may see the Ee'd Plebnista.
SIRAH,The Omega Glory,"(the woman who had been captured with Cloud William) Yes, it is written."
SIRAH,The Omega Glory,Good shall always destroy evil.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Alert status.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Force shields on maximum.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Leslie, begin sensor scan."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Kirk here.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,What's happening?
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,It's impossible.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,The twentieth century had no such
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,I'll be right there.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Something is shaking us apart.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,You're right.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Something is beaming aboard.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Security.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Transporter room, on the double."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,This is the United Spaceship Enterprise.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"I'm Captain Kirk, commanding."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Earth.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Phasers on stun.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Humans of the twentieth century do not go beaming around the galaxy, Mister Seven."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,The location of that planet?
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,And if he's lying?
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,What if it turns out you're an invading alien from the future?
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,I can't beam you down without further proof one way or the other.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Security confinement.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Sickbay.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Bones, check the prisoner you'll find in security confinement."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,I want a medical analysis fast.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Is he or isn't he human?
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"What do you make of the cat, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,This is the captain.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"All science, engineering, and supervisory personnel, lock into the briefing room."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Our next decision can be of enormous consequence, not only to us but to Earth's entire future."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,You've already been given as much information as we have.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Please break in at any time with analysis of that information.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Navigation report.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Engineering.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Mister Spock, historical report."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Weren't orbital nuclear devices one of this era's greatest problems?
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Bones, hurry with that report."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Join me in the briefing room with your analysis.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,If an alien needed a body.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Gentlemen, I need proof."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,All you're telling me is that on the one hand he may be lying and on the other
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,This is the Captain.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Inform us
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Try to override.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Shut it off!
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"If we beam down, can you compare our position with his control setting?"
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,I'm aware of that.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"But I must know if he's lying, and we can't answer that sitting up here."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Have ship's stores prepare the proper costumes.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Stand by to beam us down.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Scotty, lock in on our position."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Lead us to him.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Scotty,"
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Triangulate on this location.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Out.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Go ahead, Scotty."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Where's Mister Seven?
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Where's Mister Seven?
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Give me the phone.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Where's Mister Seven?
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Plans to McKinley Rocket Base.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Wide scan, Scotty."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,We'll be moving.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Spock, in here."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Spock!
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Now, Scotty!"
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Reverse and energise.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Launch is in forty minutes.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Stand by to beam us down.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Continue visual scan.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Scotty, beam us directly to Seven's apartment."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Hold it right there, Mister Seven."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Spock, you're the expert."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Can you detonate the warhead from this computer?
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Spock.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,I don't know what your job is!
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,You may set those controls so we can't detonate that warhead.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Spock, if you can't handle it, I'm going to have to trust him."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Go.
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Our record tapes show, although not generally revealed, that on this date, a malfunctioning suborbital warhead was exploded exactly one hundred and four miles above the Earth."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"I'm afraid we can't reveal everything we know, Mister Seven."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Yes, I think we could say that."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"Two to beam up, Scotty."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,"And the same to you, Miss Lincoln."
KIRK,Assignment: Earth,Energise.
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,Transporter room to Captain.
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"It appears we have accidentally intercepted someone's transporter beam, Captain."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,It's incredibly powerful.
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"Captain, something is beaming aboard this vessel."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,The beam is originating at least one thousand light years away.
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"If what he says is true, Captain, every second we delay him could be dangerous."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"A most difficult decision, Captain."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"Quite a lovely animal, Captain."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,I find myself strangely drawn to it.
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"He did say his planet was hidden, Captain."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"Current Earth crises would fill a tape bank, Captain."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"There will be an important assassination today, an equally dangerous government coup in Asia, and, this could be highly critical, the launching of an orbital nuclear warhead platform by the United States countering a similar launch by other powers."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,Most definitely.
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"Once the sky was full of orbiting H-bombs, the slightest mistake could have brought one down by accident, setting off a nuclear holocaust."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"He might be inclined to prepare a perfect one, Captain."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,But then again he may be telling the truth.
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"Following him down is a major risk, Captain."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,If we ourselves do anything that changes history
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"In here, Captain."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,(at door to main room)
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,Chances are he's out of sight inside the rocket gantry or at one of the control centres.
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"Here, let me help you, Sergeant."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,It's operated with this dial here.
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"I can try, Captain."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"I can estimate some of this, Captain, but without more time"
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"It is difficult to know which is best, Captain."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"Without facts, the decision cannot be made logically."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,You must rely on your human intuition.
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"Correction, Mister Seven."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,It appears we did not interfere.
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,The Enterprise was part of what was supposed to happen on this day in 1968.
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,And you'll be pleased our records show that it resulted in a new and stronger international agreement against the use of such weapons.
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"Captain, we could say that Mister Seven and Miss Lincoln have some interesting experiences in store for them."
SPOCK,Assignment: Earth,"Live long and prosper, Mister Seven."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"No transporter beam can reach that far, not even in our century."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"It's locked, it's locked our circuits wide open."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,It's impossible to hide a whole planet.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"Still unable to analyze it, sir."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"It was so powerful, it fused most of our recording circuits."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"Could have brought him back through great distances, could have brought him back through time."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,There's no way for us to know.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"We can estimate only within a thousand metres or so where he beamed down, Captain."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,Aye.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,Locked in.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,Proceed one nine five degrees true.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,Correlated.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,Readings indicate a greater altitude.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"Approximately thirty metres higher, sir."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"Proceed five metres, two four seven degrees true."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,There's an old-style weather satellite in orbit below us.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"If I could bounce off it, I could get some good views."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,I've got it.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,I could get even closer.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"If I could spot him, I could lock on and beam him up."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"Security, send two men up here right away."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,Stand by.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,I'm going to beam him up.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,I had him and something yanked him away.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,Scott here.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,I've got to risk calling the captain.
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"(over the open communicator) Captain, can you read me?"
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"I was beaming up Mister Seven, and something yanked him away from me."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,"Captain, monitors show all major powers on full missile alert."
SCOTT,Assignment: Earth,Retaliatory strike ordered on warhead impact.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Why have you intercepted me?
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Please identify yourselves.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"(to the cat) Yes, I heard him, Isis."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,We're aboard a space vessel.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,From what planet?
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,That's impossible.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"In this time period, there weren't (notices Spock) Humans with a Vulcan?"
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"You're from the future, Captain."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,You're going to have to beam me down to Earth immediately.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Careful, Isis."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,All right.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Captain Kirk.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,My name is Gary Seven.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I am a human being from the twentieth century.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I was on my way
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I've been living on another planet far more advanced.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I was beaming to Earth when you intercepted me.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,They wish their existence kept secret.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Even in your time, it will remain unknown."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Impossible for you, not for them."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Captain Kirk, I am of this time period."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,You are not.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"You interfere with me with what I have to do there, and you'll change history."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"You'll destroy the Earth and probably yourselves, too."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,This is the most critical period in Earth's history.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,The planet I'm from wants to help Earth survive.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,You're tired.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Go to sleep.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"I know, Isis."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,But we'll be gone before they get here.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"You're right, Isis."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,It is primitive.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,It's incredible that people can exist like this.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,At least we won't have to.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Not for long.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Computer on.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Specify locations of agents two oh one and three four seven.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Simply check my voice pattern.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,You'll find me listed as Supervisor one nine four.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Code name Gary Seven.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Computer, I am a class one supervisor."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,You are ordered to override previous instructions and answer my questions.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Computer, I caution you."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I have little love for Beta Five snobbery.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Override.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,All right.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Agents are male and female, descendants of human ancestors taken from Earth approximately six thousand years ago."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,They're the product of generations of training for this mission.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Problem.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Earth technology and science have progressed faster than political and social knowledge.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Purpose of mission.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,To prevent Earth's civilisation from destroying itself before it can mature into a peaceful society.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Why didn't you say so in the first place?
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"No, don't answer that."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Simply begin search immediately.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Recheck all news broadcasts, decode any government intercepted message"
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,That's the same kind of nonsense that almost destroyed planet Omicron Four.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Progress of mission Has the rocket been set to malfunction?
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,How much time before launch?
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Computer, record the following."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Unless agents are found immediately, I must undertake their mission."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Where have you been?
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Where have you been for the past three days?
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Where's three four seven?
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Two oh one, code responses are not necessary."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Sit down.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I said sit down.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I'll say one thing for you.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,You play your role well.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,But that is no longer necessary.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"I'm Supervisor one nine four, code name Gary Seven."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I need a complete report
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Yes, report."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Everything you have done for the past three Earth days.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Everything you've done.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Not with your fingers.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Wait a minute.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"You're not acting, are you?"
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Tie in to computer.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Scan unidentified female present.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Miss Lincoln.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Miss Lincoln, What kind of work did your employers say they were doing here?"
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,All right.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,You can go.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Of course, if you do, you won't be helping your country."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Unless you don't care about that.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"I don't know, Miss Lincoln, what you are, not yet."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,All I know is that my incompetence has made you aware of very secret devices that are vital to the security of this nation.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Thank you, Isis."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I'll be right in.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"(Isis leaves) It's a trained cat, Just like guard dogs, that kind of thing."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Don't let anybody in here.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I'll be busy.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,That just doesn't make sense.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,For them to die in something as useless as an automobile accident.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Are the facts verified?
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Computer off.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Yeah, sure, Sarge."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,(hands over his NSA ID) There it is.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,All right.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,All right.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Be careful, lsis."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Don't get stepped on.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"(into telephone) Security, this is Sergeant Lipton, and we're all straightened out down here."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Right, thank you very much."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Goodbye.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"All right, Sergeant."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Now let's just turn right around.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,We're going to walk this way.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,You just sit right down right right there and have a little nap.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Yes, thank you."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I know how to open it.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,(with his ubiquitous pen) I know there's not much time.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Meow?
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"You are nervous, aren't you, doll?"
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,All right.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I'm going as fast as I can.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,What are you doing?
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I wasn't finished.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,You must have intercepted the Enterprise trying to beam me on board.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Computer on.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Lock into launch site scan.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Computer, adjustments at the rocket base were not completed."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Can I still take over the rocket as planned?
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Exceiver on manual.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Lock into flight telemetry.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Visual off.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Roberta, please don't try to leave."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,You'll find all the doors locked.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Are you jealous, Isis?"
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,It's most unbecoming.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Begin malfunction at third stage.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Nine zero point zero eight.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Visual on.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Begin malfunction.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Take it off course.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Arm the warhead.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Exceiver nine one point two one eight.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Computer, rocket status."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"You've got to let me finish what I started, or in six minutes World War Three begins."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Roberta, you've got to believe me."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Look, a truly advanced planet wouldn't use force."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,They wouldn't come here in strange alien forms.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"The best of all possible methods would be to take human beings to their world, train them for generations until they're needed here."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Captain, I want that warhead detonated, too."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Unless I do it at least a hundred miles above ground, just barely in time to frighten them out of this arms race"
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Captain, he can only guess."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Will you please let me do my job.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"(grabbing the pen from her) Roberta, be careful."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,The servo is set to kill.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,There are only seconds.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,I'll need time to set it.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"Computer, go to visual."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,Count by tens.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"And in spite of the accidental interference with history by the Earth ship from the future, the mission was completed."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,So everything happened the way it was supposed to.
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,"That, Miss Lincoln, is simply my cat."
SEVEN,Assignment: Earth,What else do your record tapes show?
SECURITY,Assignment: Earth,Security.
SECURITY,Assignment: Earth,"On our way, sir."
SECURITY,Assignment: Earth,"This way, please."
SECURITY,Assignment: Earth,Security alert.
SECURITY,Assignment: Earth,All decks alert.
SECURITY,Assignment: Earth,The prisoner has escaped.
SECURITY,Assignment: Earth,All decks alert.
SECURITY,Assignment: Earth,Intruder alert.
SECURITY,Assignment: Earth,Intruder alert.
SECURITY,Assignment: Earth,Security to launch director.
SECURITY,Assignment: Earth,We have unidentified intruders.
SECURITY,Assignment: Earth,Males.
SECURITY,Assignment: Earth,A pair.

ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,"Who are you, anyway?"
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,With three four eight?
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,"Listen, friend, maybe I'd just better call the police right now."
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,Who do you think you are?
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,"Okay, I will."
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,Report.
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,Oh.
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,Everything I've done?

ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,"Well, how do you expect me to type, with my nose?"
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,Did you see that?
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,The machine typed everything I.
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,It's typing everything I'm saying!
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,Stop it.
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,Stop it!
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,Stop it!
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,(He turns it off.)

ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,"Look, hey, I mean, not even the CIA could do all this."
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,"Look, I'm sorry, but like you asked me, I do care about my country, and you can't be CIA."
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,Hold it!
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,"Hold it, Mister Seven."
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,"I'm telling you, you're through monkeying around with my country's rocket."
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,Hold it!
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,Don't move!
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,You did enough already!
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,"Mister Seven, I want to believe you."
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,I do.
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,I know this world needs help.
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,"That's why some of my generation are kind of crazy and rebels, you know."
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,We wonder if we're going to be alive when we're thirty.
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,"Oh, no."
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,"(pointing the pen at Kirk) Listen you, get away from him."
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,Please.
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,He's telling the truth.
ROBERTA,Assignment: Earth,Would you mind telling me who that is?

SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,On mark eight and closing.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,A mechanical device of unknown properties.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,I read no life forms aboard.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Obviously, it intends to intercept us."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,It has made several course changes corresponding with our own.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Unclear whether it intends to attack or merely communicate with us.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Indeed.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Vulcan, Captain."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Unquestionably.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Most impressive.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"True telepaths can be most formidable, and we have been warned."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,No recorded contacts.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"If they ever ventured into space, they evidently withdrew immediately."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"I prefer being a welcomed guest, Captain, but there seems to be little choice."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Unknown, Captain."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Sensor readings give no indication of fog like conditions in this area.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Unknown, Captain."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Unlike Mister Scott's transporter, this unit is not functioning."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"No use, Captain."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Obviously none of our devices will function.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Apparently that Melkotian buoy
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Obviously this represents the Melkotian's concept of an American frontier town, circa 1880."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Perhaps the Melkotians have insufficient data about this era.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Crude but dangerous.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Captain, the Melkot said you were the pattern."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,He looked into your mind and selected what he considered the proper time and place for our punishment.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Yes.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,The violence of your own heritage is to be the pattern for our execution.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Precisely, in terms of what the Melkots intend for us."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Are they really?
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Captain, I pride myself on my knowledge of your Earth history."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,The names were known in the annals of the opening of the western sector of America.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"the United States of America, that is."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,And the Clanton gang.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"On October 26th, they had it out."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,History cannot be changed.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Is this a dead man, Doctor?"
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Captain, since we have seen that death is the one reality in this situation, I seriously suggest you reseat yourself immediately."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Without moving a muscle of either hand.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"If I remember correctly, that would involve you in what was called the fast draw."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,It initiated unfortunate events.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,I believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with Mister Chekov.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"I assure you, sir, we shall watch it, and everything, extremely closely."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"The day is still young, Ensign."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"And if this is indeed some sort of replay of history, the Earps will kill the Clantons at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Impossible, Captain."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"In this century, there are no metal alloys or power sources to make devices such as ours."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Mister Chekov is involved, Captain."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,It is obvious the Melkotians are not going to permit us to leave this town.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"There's no way we can know where it is, Doctor."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,I could make a device to deliver it on target.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,I shall need some fusing and cotton wadding.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"I shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating canister, more familiarly known as a gas grenade."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,And it is not yet our time.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Gentlemen, there is one thing which requires the immediate attention of all of us."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Specifically, our future."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"I understand the feeling, Captain."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"My feelings are not a subject for discussion, Doctor."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Captain, it's quite all right."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,They forget I am half human.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Captain.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"I vaguely remember the historical account of the famous battle in which we are about to engage, but I am confused."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Since each of us represents members of the Clanton gang.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"You, Ike Clanton, I, Frank McLowery, then Mister Chekov would be the other Billy, would he not?"
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,But did not William Claiborne survive the battle at the OK Corral?
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Mister Chekov is dead.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"But in the actual gunfight, William Claiborne survived."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Another hour.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Not precisely.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,It should.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Negotiating with them could buy us more time, Captain."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"It would be worth a try, at least until we're certain of the device."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Then perhaps we could quiet things down.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,These crude supplies we were forced to use worked quite well.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Perhaps they would've been if they'd had your ingenuity, Doctor."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Captain?
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Right now.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,It has not been tested.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,But this is painless.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Captain, you don't seem to understand."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"It did not function, but it must function."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"A scientific fact But if the tranquilliser does not function, which is clearly impossible, then a radical alteration of our thought patterns must be in order."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,That may not be necessary.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"A fact, Captain."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Physical laws simply cannot be ignored.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Existence cannot be without them.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"I mean, Doctor, that we are faced with a staggering contradiction."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,The tranquilliser you created should have been effective.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Exactly.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Doctor, in your opinion, what killed Mister Chekov?"
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Wrong.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,His mind killed him.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Physical reality is consistent with universal laws.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Where the laws do not operate, there is no reality."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,All of this is unreal.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,But you made your examination under conditions which we cannot trust.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,We judge reality by the response of our senses.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Once we are convinced of the reality of a given situation, we abide by its rules."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"We judged the bullets to be solid, the guns to be real, therefore they can kill."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,He may indeed be dead.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,We do not know.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Exactly.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"I know the bullets are unreal, therefore they cannot harm me."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Precisely.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,The smallest doubt would be enough to kill you.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Very well, sir."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Engineer?
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Your mind to my mind.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Your thoughts to my thoughts.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,(to McCoy) The bullets are unreal.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Without body.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,They are illusions only.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Shadows without substance.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"They will not pass through your body, for they do not exist."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Captain.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Captain, the Melkotian object."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"The object is beginning to emit M-rays of a highly unstable nature, Captain."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Energy output increasing beyond measurable levels, Captain."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,Captain.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,May I ask a question?
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,You needn't answer if it seems too personal.
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"This afternoon, you wanted to kill, didn't you?"
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"But he wanted to, Doctor."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Mankind, ready to kill."
SPOCK,Spectre Of The Gun,I wonder how humanity managed to survive.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Steady as she goes.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Phaser crew, stand by."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Sensor readings?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Analysis, Science Officer?"
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Thank you, Science Officer."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Come to one eight one mark seven.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,It's staying with us.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Full stop, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Hold your position.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,English.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Interesting.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Telepathy.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Our orders are very clear.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We're to establish contact with the Melkotians at all costs.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,What previous contacts have been made with the Melkotians?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Lieutenant, hailing frequencies."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We've contacted your buoy and understand its message.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We hope that you will understand that our intent is to establish peaceful relations with you.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Lieutenant, answer?"
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Try again.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Opinion, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,None whatsoever.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Mister Chekov, deflectors at full intensity."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Increase speed to achieve planet fall as scheduled.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Lieutenant Uhura, advise Doctor McCoy and Engineer Scott to meet me in the transporter room."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Mister Spock, Mister Chekov, let's go find out what it is they're afraid of."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Spock, what is this?"
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Tricorder readings, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Then let's get out of here.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Come in.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"We come in peace, but we'll defend ourselves if necessary."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Spock, evaluation?"
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Or perhaps this is all they require to complete the pattern of our death.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Beautiful specimen.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Whatever the Melkotians have planned for us, it won't be pleasant."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,These could be useful.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Just remember one thing.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"To individuals at close range, these could be as deadly as phasers."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"(reading from a newspaper pinned up) October 26, 1881."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Tombstone, Arizona."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,But why here?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,And why now?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Because my ancestors pioneered the American frontier.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"There's something about that date, October 26, 1881 But what was it?"
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Looks like we did.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,You know us?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I'm a barrel of laughs.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Johnny?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"He called me lke, you Frank, Bones Tom, and Billy."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Ike Clanton, Tom and Frank McLowery, Billy Claiborne, Billy Clanton."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"In the late nineteenth century in Arizona, two factions fought for control of the town of Tombstone."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"The Earps, Morgan, Virgil and Wyatt, who were the town marshals, along with Doc Holliday."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"The Clantons lost, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We are the Clantons.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,And if this is a replay of history
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,That's one thing we can be sure of.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Death is real.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Yes, of course."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,The man who kills on sight.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Morgan Earp.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Good old Virgil.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We can always count on him.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I don't think we're going to have any choice.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"No, no, no."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"All right, all right, all right."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We don't want any trouble.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Just leave us alone, Mister Earp."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,That's all we ask.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I guess so.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Er, Mister Chekov?"
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Young lady.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Young lady.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"I'd like to talk to Mister, to Billy alone, if you don't mind."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Mister Chekov, you be careful."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Mister Spock, except for our hand guns, we haven't changed, not even our clothing, yet these people see and hear us as the Clantons."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"All right, what have we got?"
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"We're here in Tombstone, Arizona, October 26, 1881."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,The day of the gunfight at OK Corral.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"And we're the Clantons, and Morgan Earp has just gone to tell his brothers we're here."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Well, we're not going to be at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"You, bartender."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Ed.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"You, er, you claim you know us."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Take a close look at me.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Who do you think I am?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"I know this is hard to understand, but I'm Captain James T. Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,These men are part of my crew.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"We're not really here, we're from the future."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We haven't been born yet.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Feel the material in my shirt.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Now feel the material in your own shirt.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Do you notice any difference?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Do these clothes look like yours?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Have you seen clothes like this before?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Where?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I'm not joking.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I'm not joking!
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I'm not Ike Clanton!
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Good morning, gentlemen."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,My name's James Kirk.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I'm afraid there's been some sort of misunderstanding.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Yes, of course you did, and I wanted to talk to you about that."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"There's been some sort of mistake, a misunderstanding."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Yes.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We'd be glad to.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We don't want to fight.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"I'll make one more attempt to get through to you, Mister Earp."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"My name is not Clanton, it's Kirk."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I'm not joking.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Not me, Mister Earp."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We don't want any trouble.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We'll be glad to co-operate.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,What do you call that stuff?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Fire?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Label it for external use Only.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,And your reflexes.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We're going to need fast reflexes from now on.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,There's no negotiating with the Earps.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We know that.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Could we make a communicator?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"The problem is clear, Spock."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We're going to have to seek contemporary solutions.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Where's Chekov?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Mister Chekov, I mean Billy."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Come along.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Gentlemen.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,To exercise the better part of valour.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Well, that settles that."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,A force field.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Mister Chekov.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"If you were in charge of the Enterprise, what would you be doing?"
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Very good.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"If we could find the place where we beamed down, the ship might lock in and beam us up."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,It could be anywhere within a thousand mile radius.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We have until five o'clock to find that way.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Now consider this.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,What materials were on hand in 1881 that could help us fight the Earps on their own terms?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"No, the Melkots gave us those to execute us."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We have to find a way to put the Earps out of action.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Is there anything that exists here and now that could help us out of this trap?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Bones, the venom, the plants."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Can you make use of them?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"First, Bones, the ingredients you require."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Chekov, mortar and pestle."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,How do you intend to deliver the tranquilliser on target?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Cotton wadding.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Try the apothecary.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,No.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Yes, we can."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Scotty, they're trying to push us into something we're not ready for."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Maybe he wouldn't be if I hadn't ignored the Melkot warning.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"But not this minute, Spock."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,It takes us a little longer.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Bones, Scotty."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,About what?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"William Claiborne, that's right."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Yes.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Yes, that's right."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,That means it doesn't have to happen the way it happened.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We can change it.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Bones, how's the tranquilliser coming?"
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Spock?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,And we'll have a tranquilliser grenade?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Forget precision.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Will it work?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Make sure it does, Spock."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"If we don't tranquillise them, we'll have to fight them."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,But not with the Earps.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I've tried that.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,That's out.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,There must be a way.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"History has been changed in the fact that Billy Claiborne didn't die, but Chekov is lying there dead."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,That means there must be a way to change this history.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Not with the Earps.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,There is one other place I can try.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Yes, Sheriff."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I want you to stop the fight.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I do now.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,How else is he going to get justice?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,It's not too late.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Sheriff.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Sheriff.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,There must be plenty of decent people in town who don't like the Earps.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Let's organise them.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Then the people had better wake up and let the law work for them.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Yes, I want revenge."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I want to crush the life out of the Earps.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,But I can't just kill them.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Can't I get it through your stupid head?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I can't just kill them!
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I can't murder them!
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I can't kill them!
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I can't kill them!
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,How soon will that be ready?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Good.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,How long will it take the tranquilliser to have effect?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,How did you manage to test it?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Up to now, everything has gone wrong."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I want it tested now.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,It doesn't work.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,It was our last chance.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We need a weapon.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,An answer.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Ten minutes and it's all going to end at the OK Corral.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Well, we're going to wait right here until well after five o'clock."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We're not going to move from this spot.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Let's get out of here.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Scotty, Bones."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,(and it's all the way around.)
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We're trapped.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,They got their way.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We've got to stand and fight.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,They're experts at gunfighting.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We don't have a chance.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Spock, you've got something?"
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,It would've been effective anywhere else.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Chekov is dead because he believed the bullets would kill him.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,But we do know that the Melkotians created the situation.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"If we do not allow ourselves to believe that the bullets are real, they cannot kill us."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"We must all be as certain as you are, Mister Spock, to save our lives."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We must.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Spock, a Vulcan mind meld."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Right here, it seems."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Do you remember anything else?
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Good.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Perhaps that explains why he's here.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Nothing was real to him except the girl.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Sensor readings.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Lieutenant, sound Red Alert."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Mister Chekov, deflector shields on full."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Phaser gun crews, lock on target."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Phaser guns, stand by to fire."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Damage report, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,It is.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We fight only when there's no choice.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We prefer the ways of peaceful contact.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,I speak for a vast alliance of fellow creatures who believe in the same thing.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We have sought you out to join us.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Our mission is still one of peace.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,Excellent.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Lieutenant, cancel Red Alert."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Mister Chekov, resume original course, warp factor two."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"I'm sure I'll be able to give you an answer, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Is that the way it seemed to you, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,"Mister Spock, you're absolutely right."
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,That's exactly the way it was.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,That's the way it was in 1881.
KIRK,Spectre Of The Gun,We overcame our instinct for violence.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"Range, forty five thousand kilometres, Captain."
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"Range, forty three thousand kilometres and closing."
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Thirty eight thousand and closing.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Thirty five thousand and closing.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"Aye, aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"It was Russian, sir."
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Every word.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Standard orbit in five minutes.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Then what are we doing here?
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"Where are we now, Captain?"
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Who won?
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,And we are the Clantons?
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"Oh, you knew that?"
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,And pass up an opportunity to see you?
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Don't be silly.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Get your hands off her.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"What can I do, Captain?"
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,You know we're always supposed to maintain good relations with the natives.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,(he kisses her)
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"I don't think that's such a bad thing, Captain."
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,With his outdated weapon?
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"If he shoots at me, I will just step out of the way."
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,A lot of people and things have tried to kill me.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,You'd be surprised.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"Yes, sir."
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"Where are we going, Captain?"
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"Yes, but where is the Enterprise?"
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,I'd be using the ship's sensors trying to locate us.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,All those western Cossacks had were poisonous snakes and cactus plants.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Sylvia!
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Hello.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,That's very nice.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,That's just what I was preparing to inquire.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Have you been shopping?
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"No, no, I haven't forgotten."
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,I am looking forward to it most eagerly.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Married?
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,I'm afraid that wouldn't be possible.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,But it is absolutely impossible.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,I am not someone you can marry.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,If only I could make clear to you what I really am.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Mister Earp.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Get your hands off her.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"Captain, I don't understand."
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,What happened?
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,Where have I been?
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,But that girl.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,She was so beautiful.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,So real.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,No.
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"It's, it's gone, sir."
CHEKOV,Spectre Of The Gun,"Warp factor two, sir."
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,"Aliens, you have encroached on the space of the Melkot."
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,You will turn back immediately.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,This is the only warning you will receive.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,(a pair of red eyes in the fog) Aliens.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,Our warning was plain.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,You have disregarded it.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,You shall be punished.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,"You, Captain Kirk, the disobedience was on your orders."
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,Yours is the responsibility.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,Yours shall be the pattern of your death.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,You are outside.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,You are disease.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,The disease must be destroyed.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,"Your plea has been heard, and sentence has been pronounced."
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,It is done.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,Captain Kirk.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,You did not kill.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,Is this the way of your kind?
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,Approach our planet and be welcome.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,A delegation will come out to meet you.
MELKOT,Spectre Of The Gun,Our warning threats are over.
UHURA,Spectre Of The Gun,"No, Captain."
UHURA,Spectre Of The Gun,It was Swahili.
UHURA,Spectre Of The Gun,"Tied in, sir."
UHURA,Spectre Of The Gun,"Nothing, sir."
UHURA,Spectre Of The Gun,Clear on all frequencies.
UHURA,Spectre Of The Gun,"Still no response, sir."
UHURA,Spectre Of The Gun,"No damage, sir."
UHURA,Spectre Of The Gun,All decks report fully operational.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,I knew it had to happen.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,It's a fine time for that transporter mechanism to break down.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,It's just bits and pieces.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,It's incomplete.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"In the midst of what seems so unreal, the harsh reality."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,This is not a dream.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,Tombstone.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Hell for leather, right out of history."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,What's the matter with us?
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"We're talking like we really are in Tombstone, Arizona in 1881."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Very dead, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,What's the matter?
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,Taos Lightning straight bourbon.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,Try some.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"In small amounts, it was considered medicinal."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Take it easy, Mister Scott."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,I hate to think what that stuff's doing to your stomach lining.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,Or a communicator.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,It'd be a pleasure to watch those Earps as we beamed back to the ship at exactly four fifty nine thirty.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,Well let's get there.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Mister Spock, why don't you join us common humanoids in trying to find a way out of here, and quit explaining why we can't get out of here."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,A tranquilliser.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Of course, Jim."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,I can make a tranquilliser!
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,I know the place to get the proper drugs.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,I'll need a mortar and a pestle.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Well, thank you."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,Mind if I look around a bit?
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"(checking the bottles) Crude, but very useable."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Oh, you don't have to worry."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,I know how to handle this.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"I have an urgent need for a small supply of this drug, too."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Oh, so you're the dentist."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Well, I'm a physician, and I have a serious emergency."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,I wonder if you mind if I borrow a small quantity of this.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,My name is McCoy.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,I'm a doctor.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,The emergency is real.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,I need these things.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"That is my intention, Doctor."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"There's nothing I can do, Jim."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Let it go, Jim."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,He's dead.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,We all knew the risk when we joined the service.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,Now let it go.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,You talk about another man's feelings.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"What do you feel, Spock?"
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,Because there are no feelings to discuss.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Spock will have no truck with grief, Scotty."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,It's human.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,We don't have much time.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Get to the point, Spock."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,I'll have it ready before Spock.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"And if we fight them, we all die."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,We know that.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,I doubt that this combination of things was ever used for any purpose quite like this.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,Three or four seconds.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"It's not necessary, Captain."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,It's very simple.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,Nothing can go wrong.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,It would.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,Guaranteed.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,It should have worked.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Did you inhale the gas, Scotty?"
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,You still feel all right?
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,No dizziness?
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,No sweating?
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,No palpitations?
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Nothing could go wrong, Captain."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,It should work.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"You don't have to worry about that now, Jim."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,Look at the clock.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Then we'd better become experts, and fast."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"What do you mean, Spock?"
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,A piece of lead in his body.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Come on, Spock."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"If you've got the answer, tell us."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,What do you mean unreal?
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,I examined Chekov.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,He's dead.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,But that's not possible.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,There'd always be some doubt.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"We're just human beings, Spock."
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,We don't have that clockwork ticker in our head like you do.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,We can't turn it on and off.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,They do not exist.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,Neither do I.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,He's in perfect health.
MCCOY,Spectre Of The Gun,"But he didn't kill, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,"Impossible, Doctor McCoy."
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,My transporter was working perfectly.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,"And these, Captain?"
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,(the guns)
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,It's impossible!
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,Things like this can't happen.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,Absolutely.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,Half a gallon of scotch.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,"It just takes a bit of getting used to, Captain."
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,"Actually, a man could grow quite fond of this stuff."
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,Aye.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,If we only had a phaser.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,If we could only contact the Enterprise.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,"(showing his gun) We have these, Captain."
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,Aye.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,(leaves)
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,"Captain, let me."
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,"Captain, we can't just stand here and take it."
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,But they murdered Chekov!
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,If you think I'm going to
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,"Mister Spock, Chekov is dead!"
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,"I say it now, and I can hardly believe it."
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,But you worked closely with him.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,That deserves some memorial.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,Would a volunteer solve the problem?
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,All right.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,On one condition.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,That I'm wide awake and with you at five o'clock.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,Aye.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,(has a slug of whiskey) It's to kill the pain.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,"Well, you should've warned me sooner, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,Fire away.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,Aye.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,Deeply.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,I never felt better.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,Good.
SCOTT,Spectre Of The Gun,"If they want a fight, let's gie'em a fight."
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Ike!
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Ike!
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Frank!
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Billy!
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Tom!
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"(shakes Kirk's hand) Ike, I was afraid you weren't going to make it."
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,I knew you wouldn't let them scare you away.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,They're a bunch of hot air if you ask me.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Now they're going to have to fight after the way they shot off their mouths.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Funny.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"That's what I like about you, lke."
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,You always see the funny side.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Nobody can say Johnny Behan doesn't have a sense of humour.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,(walks on)
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,You looking for somebody?
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Stop it?
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Who wants to stop it?
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,I sure don't.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,You don't.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,You didn't yesterday.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Since when does a Clanton run crawling to the law for help?
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,(indicating gun) From this.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,You and your boys set up this whole thing to take care of the Earps.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,It's a little late to decide you don't have the belly for it.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Don't talk nonsense.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,The people in this town are counting on you to get rid of the Earps for them.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,You can talk that way after what the Earps did to Billy today?
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Nobody in this town will deny you your right to your revenge.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,You listen to me.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Get down to the OK Corral.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Keep out of sight.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"When the Earps come looking, you bushwhack them."
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,It's the only way.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Kill them any way you can!
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,There'll be no questions asked.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Honest.
BEHAN,Spectre Of The Gun,I guarantee that!
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"Ike, Frank, hiya, boys."
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,I didn't think I'd see you again.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,You boys want your usual?
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"You know we ain't got nothing but bourbon, unless you want corn whiskey."
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,(bringing a bottle and glasses.)
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"Close, Ike."
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Lucky there wasn't two of them.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Sylvia's right.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,They've been bad-mouthing something fierce all over town.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,You boys watch it.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,I ain't making no big claims about you to nobody.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Just so happens.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Yeah?
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Ike Clanton.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Who do you think you are?
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,No.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Not exactly.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Sure.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,On the Clantons.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,You Clantons are always great with your jokes.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,That's why we like you.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,The only difference between you and the Earps is that they never joke.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"It's okay with me, Ike."
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Anything you say.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Don't make no difference who I think you are.
BARMAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"Your problem is, who does Wyatt Earp think you are?"
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,Billy!
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"Oh, Billy!"
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"(kisses Chekov) Billy, baby, I knew they couldn't keep you out of town."
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,Come on.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,Maybe you shouldn't have.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,It's taking crazy chances with Morgan Earp right in the same room.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,I wish it was all over.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,I saw Virgil out patrolling this morning.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,They've been blowing off all over town about how they chased the Clantons out.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"I guess you'll show them now, won't you?"
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"Billy, you were wonderful."
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,(she kisses him)
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"Yes, Ike?"
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,All right.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,I understand.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"Billy Claiborne, you be careful."
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"You shouldn't have come back to town, Billy."
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,Morgan'll kill you because he wants me.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,You can joke about it.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,I've seen them in action.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,Especially Morgan.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,Billy?
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"Please, don't even go near him."
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,Ahem.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"Billy Claiborne, you know how crazy I am about you."
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"Well, aren't you going to ask me what I've got in my shopping bag?"
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"Of course, silly!"
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,What else would I be doing on a beautiful afternoon with the dance only one week away?
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,Or have you forgotten that already?
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,You will be absolutely wild when you see me in the new gown I'm going to make.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"I found this most scrumptious material, yards and yards of it."
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"You know what I was thinking, Billy?"
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,I was thinking what a beautiful wedding gown it would make.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,Why don't we just turn that dance into a wedding ball?
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,It would be so heavenly.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,But I'm positive the gown will be ready.
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,What else is there to stop a wedding?
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,Do you think I don't know?
SYLVIA,Spectre Of The Gun,"Billy Claiborne, you are a cattle rustler and a horse thief and I don't care what else."
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,You'll dirty yourself with this scum.
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Come on.
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"Now, Claiborne."
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"If you don't want any trouble, what are you doing in my town?"
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Five of you.
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"You'd like me to draw, wouldn't you?"
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"All right, I will."
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Soon enough.
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Soon enough.
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"We're done talking, Clanton."
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"I always said you was yellow, Clanton."
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"Oh, yeah."
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,We heard the talk about your jokes.
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Sure.
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"Well, I'm glad to meet you Mister Kirk."
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"No, Wyatt."
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Let me.
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"When the time comes, I'll pay him for this."
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"I warned you, Claiborne."
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,Stay away.
MORGAN,Spectre Of The Gun,"You don't have to take anything from that scum, not while I'm here."
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,"Clanton, I don't know what you're trying to pull, but we warned you not to show your ugly face in town again."
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,"All right, Clanton."
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,One more chance.
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,Your last.
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,You've got until five tonight to get your horse-stealing scurvy crew out of town.
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,All the way.
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,"Draw, Clanton."
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,You draw or I will.
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,"Five o'clock, Clanton."
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,Is that clear?
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,"If you're in town at five oh one, we'll kill every one of you whether you draw or not."
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,Is that clear?
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,"Come on, Clanton."
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,Let's do it now.
WYATT,Spectre Of The Gun,Draw.
BARBER,Spectre Of The Gun,I'll be about five minutes yet.
BARBER,Spectre Of The Gun,You could come back.
BARBER,Spectre Of The Gun,I wouldn't touch that stuff if I was you.
BARBER,Spectre Of The Gun,That stuff ain't mine.
BARBER,Spectre Of The Gun,It belongs to him.
BARBER,Spectre Of The Gun,You'd better ask him.
HOLLIDAY,Spectre Of The Gun,You want it now?
HOLLIDAY,Spectre Of The Gun,"That joke is all around town already, McLowery."
HOLLIDAY,Spectre Of The Gun,But my name is still Holliday.
HOLLIDAY,Spectre Of The Gun,Doc Holliday.
HOLLIDAY,Spectre Of The Gun,Your emergency sure is real.
HOLLIDAY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Go on, take the stuff."
HOLLIDAY,Spectre Of The Gun,Have some more fun.
HOLLIDAY,Spectre Of The Gun,Take my bag.
HOLLIDAY,Spectre Of The Gun,Only best you be finished before five o'clock.
HOLLIDAY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Because at one minute past five, you'll find a hole in your head."
HOLLIDAY,Spectre Of The Gun,Right from this gun.
HOLLIDAY,Spectre Of The Gun,"Yeah, come on, Captain."
HOLLIDAY,Spectre Of The Gun,Let him.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Some desk-bound Starfleet bureaucrat cut these cloak-and-dagger orders.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,My orders are to co-operate with Ambassador Petri in all matters pertaining to his mission here.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Scotty.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,(Scott presses the intercom button) Kirk here.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,What is it?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Demand?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,What delay?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,All right.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Beam them aboard.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Ambassador Petri, would you drop all this nonsense and tell me what this is about?"
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Dohlman?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,What the devil is a Dohlman?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I'm Captain Kirk.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,This ship is under my command.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,This ship is secure and we're prepared for any hostile acts.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Energise.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Body armour, nuclear weapons."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Well, now, just a moment."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,There's going to have to be some kind of understanding.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,My first officer Mister Spock will show you to your quarters.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Ambassador, I'd like to speak to you."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,May I have your permission to go?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Why, thank you."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Ambassador.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Ambassador, I think it's time you told me what's going on."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I see.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"So, we go back to Troyius."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,And you are to be her teacher?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Yes, that I can understand."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Troyius."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Sulu, impulse drive, speed factor point zero three seven."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Yes, that's correct, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Sublight factor point zero three seven.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"You in a hurry, Mister Scott?"
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Yes, I appreciate your sacrifice, Lieutenant Uhura."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I'll talk to her myself.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I understand you're not happy with your quarters.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Yes, not happy at all."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,My communications officer generously vacated the rooms hoping you would find it satisfactory.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Your Glory doesn't seem to be responding to instruction.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,There are none better.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I suggest you make do with these.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"There are no more available, but if that's the only way you can get gratification, I'll arrange to have the whole room filled from floor to ceiling with breakable objects."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Then act in a civilised fashion.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I didn't ask for any.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Ambassador!
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,This is supposed to be a peaceful mission.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,You're as bad as she is.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,It's not required that you like each other.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Just do your job.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Stop trying to kill each other.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Then worry about being friendly.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Then make her listen, Ambassador."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Use a different approach.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Stop being so diplomatic.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,She respects strength.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Go in strong.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Hydrogen cloud reflection?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Speculation?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,It's not an instrument malfunction.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,It's not a reflection from a natural phenomenon.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,A spaceship?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Kirk here.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Hang on, Scotty."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Be pleasant no matter how much it hurts.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I'll be right down.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Mister Scott!
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I wish you had told me you wanted a tour of the engineering department.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Courtesy.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Remember?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Courtesy is for everyone around here, and you'll find you won't be able to exist on Troyius without it."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Scott, our Chief Engineer, has shown you his engineering department."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,That's a courtesy.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,You respond by saying thank you.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Kirk here.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,On my way.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Whose?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Main screen.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Extreme magnification.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,A Klingon warship.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"(after a few moments) Any change, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Kirk here.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,What is it?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,On my way.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"I said talk with her, not fight with her."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Yes.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Certainly.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,What was it?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Ambassador, there's an added complication."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,The Federation High Commissioner will be attending the wedding.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I'm not asking you to have anything to do with me.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Do your job with her.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,How long before he's on his feet?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Nothing would please me more, Your Glory."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,But your impetuous nature
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,You Elasians pride yourselves on being a warrior people.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,You must understand discipline to be able to give and take orders.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,My orders are to take you to Troyius to be married and to see that you learn Troyian customs.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,It's been my experience that the prejudices people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Well, we're still faced with the same problem."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Yes, the problem of your indoctrination to Troyian customs and manners."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,You have eliminated the teacher.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,The problem still remains.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,By giving you a new teacher.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Table manners, for one thing."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,This is a plate.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,It contains food.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,This is a knife.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,It cuts the food.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,This is a glass.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Like it or not, you're going to learn what you've been ordered to learn."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,That's impossible.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,That's the first problem we're going to work on.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Then we'll get you ready to go to Troyius.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,You enjoy the privileges and prerogatives of being a Dohlman.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Then be worthy of them.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"If you don't want the obligations that go along with the title, then give it up."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,That's another one of your problems.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Nobody's told you that you're an uncivilized savage, a vicious child in a woman's body, an arrogant monster!"
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,That's no way to treat someone who's telling you the truth.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Tomorrow's lesson will be on courtesy.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Lieutenant, open up the hailing frequency, identify us, and ask the Klingon his intentions."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I see.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"All right, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Monitor all frequencies.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Phaser crews stand by.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Maintain Yellow Alert.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Where's Kryton?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Will you tell Her Glory that Captain Kirk requests the honour of a visit.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"When they wake up, take them to Security holding."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Spock, the women on your planet are logical."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,That's the only planet in this galaxy that can make that claim.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Only in self-defence.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Now, are you going to behave or not?"
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,We're not on Elas.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,We're on my starship.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I command here.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"If I touch you again, Your Glory, it'll be to administer an ancient Earth custom called a spanking, a form of punishment administered to spoiled brats."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"You forget, Your Glory, we haven't started your lesson in courtesy."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Very well.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I'll send in Mister Spock or Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Either way, you're going to be properly prepared for Troyius."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"As ordered by councils, rulers, and bureaucrats."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"No, no, you were right the first time."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,There's nothing I can teach you.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,There's nothing you do not know.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Well, it's not it's not that people hate you."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,It's just that people don't like to be treated as though they don't exist.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"It's, er, gotten very, er."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Something must've gone wrong with the ventilation system.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Pardon me, Your Glory."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,There will be a short recess.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"It's, er, It's, er."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,We'll talk about it later.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Kirk here.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Inside the Enterprise?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Can you pinpoint it?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Security to Engineering.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Intruder alert.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Security alert to all decks.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Kirk out.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,It's Klingon.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Bones?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,What kind of signal did you send the Klingon ship?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Yes, I'm aware you're trained to resist any form of physical torture."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Kirk to Spock.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Spock, it was Kryton transmitting."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,He refuses to talk.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I'll need you for the Vulcan mind meld.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,What was he trying to cover that was so important he felt he had to die for it?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Scotty, he didn't come into Engineering just to use the transmitter."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I want you to check every relay you've got.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Don't waste the time telling me about it.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Get to it.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,He sold out to the Klingons because of jealousy?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,There's a Klingon warship out there.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,What's their involvement?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Surely all of this isn't because they want to stop a marriage.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Elaan.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Elaan, two planets, an entire star system's stability depends on it."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,We have a duty to forget what happened.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,My orders and yours say that you belong to another man.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"What happened, what happened was an accident."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,What kind of a mind could think of such a thing?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,What?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,It's true.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Bones, you've got to find me an antidote."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Captain here.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I'm on my way.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Battle stations.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Phasers stand by.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Chekov, lay in a course to take us out of this star system."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"If they want to fight, Let's get some manoeuvering room."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,All right.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Ahead warp factor two.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Belay that order.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"What is it, Scotty?"
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Scotty, that bomb he planted."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Can you dismantle it?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Give us every ounce of power you can from the impulse drive, and find a solution to the bomb."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Kirk out.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Sulu, stand by to make your manoeuvres smartly."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,She'll be sluggish on response.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Phaser crews, stand by to fire on command."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Ready.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Hold your fire.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Yes, their tactics are quite clear now, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,They were trying to make us cut in warp drive.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,That way we'd have blown ourselves up and solved their problem for them without risking war with the Federation.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Very neat.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Yes, a very good question, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I'll be the judge.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Yes, you're quite right."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,(to Elaan) I want you to go to Sickbay.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,It's the best protected part of the ship.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Your presence here is interfering with my efficiency, my ability to protect you."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Spock, you have the conn."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Deck five.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"If I can accomplish my mission by turning tail and running, I'll gladly do that."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Yes.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Yes, Elaan."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,No.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Kirk here.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,No chance of restoring warp drive?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Kirk out.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Elaan, I have to go back to the Bridge."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Please, you must go to Sickbay."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,They're trying to force a fight.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Scotty, what's our energy status?"
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,And let the Klingons know they succeeded in wiping out our warp engines?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"We'll stall for time, proceed on course and hope the Klingons can be bluffed."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Or that they're not prepared for a general war.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Open a hailing frequency.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise on Federation business.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Our mission is peaceful, but we're not prepared to accept any interference."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I'd say our strategy wasn't totally effective.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Scotty, can you give me partial power on the phaser banks?"
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I told you to stay in Sickbay.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,We're not going to die.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Now get off the bridge.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Sulu, bring her to one four three mark two."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Keep our forward shields to him.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Stay with the controls.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Keep our forward shields to him.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Hard over, Sulu."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Bring her around.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,He's going for our flank.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,(another disruptor hit) Sulu!
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,How bad?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"What sort of readings, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Elaan?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,What kind of jewels are in this?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Common stones?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Now I see why the Klingons are interested in this system.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,May I have this?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,You may have just saved our lives.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Spock, do you think Scotty could make use of dilithium crystals?"
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Sulu, prepare on my order to turn quickly to port."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Try and protect the number four shield.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Now, Sulu."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,hard a-port!
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,This is Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,May I request your terms for surrender?
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Scotty, your estimate."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Test it in combat.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Let me know when it's in place.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Open a hailing frequency.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,This is the Enterprise.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Will you guarantee the safety of our passenger, the Dohlman from Elas?"
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,You and Spock get up here.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Sulu, prepare for warp manoeuvres."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Chekov, arm photon torpedoes."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Negative.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,His sensors will pick up our power increase.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"The more helpless he thinks we are, the closer he'll come."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"As he passes, I want to cut in warp drive."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,We'll pivot at warp two and bring all tubes to bear.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Chekov, give him a full spread of photon torpedoes."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Scotty, stand by to cut in warp drive."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Fire at minimum range.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Warp in, Scotty."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Full power to shields.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Warp factor two.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Bring us to course one four eight mark three.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Chekov, photon torpedoes."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Fire!
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Secure from general quarters.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Well done, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Scotty.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,No.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Sulu, resume course for Troyius."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,No.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,I have no choice.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Goodbye.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Energise.
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Sulu, prepare to take us out of orbit."
KIRK,Elaan of Troyius,Ahead warp factor two.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"Aye, but why the secrecy?"
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,This star system's under Federation control.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"From what I've seen, it's not worth fighting about."
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"Why are we here, Captain?"
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,Captain?
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,You'll not be using the warp drive?
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,All the way on impulse?
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,That'll take a great deal of time.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,No.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,Engineering to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, I know what you said about showing respect, but must I have these persons fool around with my equipment?"
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"Well, I suppose, lassie, that even our impulse engines must seem fast compared to your nuclear propulsion units."
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,Menials?
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"Without engines, there'd be no fighting or"
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"Nobody saw him, but that devil sneaked back in here some way."
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,Watson must've caught him and he was killed for it.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,He had this.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,Looks like some sort of transmitter.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, you must realise the time"
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,Aye.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, the matter-antimatter"
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,The anti-matter pods are rigged to blow up the moment we go into warp drive.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,Not without being blown halfway across the galaxy.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,Scott to Captain.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"I've got bad news, Captain."
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,The entire dilithium crystal converter assembly is fused.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,No chance of repair.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,It's completely unusable.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,Not without dilithium crystals.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,We can't even generate enough power to fire our weapons.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"Ninety three percent of impulse power, sir."
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,Manoeuvre?
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,Aye.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,We can wallow like a garbage scow against a warp-driven starship.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"Our shields will hold for a few passes, but without the matter-antimatter reactor, we've no chance."
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, can you not call Starfleet on this emergency?"
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"No, sir, not a chance."
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"We're fitting it now, sir, but we'll have to run a few tests to make sure."
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"Aye, that could blow us up just as effectively as"
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,Scott to Captain.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,"It's in place, sir, but I can't answer for what happens."
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,Fluctuation.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,It's the shape of the crystals.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,I was afraid of that.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,She won't steady down.
SCOTT,Elaan of Troyius,(to Spock) It's stabilised now.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"It's in a border area, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,The Klingons also claim jurisdiction.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Sounds typical of the Elasians.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,The scientists who made the initial investigation reported the men were vicious and arrogant.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"Not without precedent, Captain."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Remember that
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,I am the first officer.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,This is Captain James Kirk.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, the Dohlman is dissatisfied with the quarters provided."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"I do not know, but all the Elasians seem most irrational."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"At first it appeared to be a sensor ghost, but I've run checks on all the instrumentation."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,All the equipment is functioning perfectly.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,None in this area.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Nothing that would account for it.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,The ghost appears intermittently.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"None, Captain."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Insufficient data.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Bridge to Captain.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,That sensor ghost is moving closer.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, we had a momentary fix on the object enough to establish it was a spaceship."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,No data yet.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Our ghost has materialised.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,The Klingon ship has simply moved into contact range.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"She is pacing us, precisely matching our sublight speed and on a parallel course."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, your analysis of the situation was flawless, anticipating that she would deny you admittance."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"However, the logic by which you arrived at your conclusion escapes me."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"I have it on my sensor, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,I am triangulating now.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,It's coming from the engineering section.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Captain?
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Captain.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,May we see you a moment?
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, are you all right?"
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"It is true then, Captain?"
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"Their speed is better than warp six, Captain."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,I don't think they meant to attack us.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,We were very fortunate this time.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Very.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,But why do the Klingons consider the possession of this system so vital?
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"I have another question, Captain."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Is not the bridge the wrong place for the Dohlman at a time like this?
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,They demand an immediate reply.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,We can still manoeuvre.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Help could not arrive before the Enterprise would be destroyed.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,He's passed us.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,All shields held.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Better than warp seven.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,He's past us again.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Damage to number four shield.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"It will not withstand another full charge, Captain."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,I'm getting some very peculiar energy readings.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,She is the source.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,The necklace.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,These are common stones?
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"(scans them) See, Captain?"
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Here and here.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"No doubt, Captain."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, these are crude crystals."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,There is no way to judge what the unusual shapes will do to the energy flow.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Damage to Klingon number three shield.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Number four shield obliterated.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,Loss of manoeuvre power.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"You are too late, Doctor."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,The Captain has found his own antidote.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"The antidote to a woman of Elas, Doctor, is a starship."
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,The Enterprise infected the Captain long before the Dohlman did.
SPOCK,Elaan of Troyius,"In this particular instance, Doctor, I agree with you."
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, I have a signal from the Elasians."
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"They're ready to beam aboard, and they demand an explanation for the delay."
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"What's the matter with them, Mister Spock?"
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,I gave up my quarters because I
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,Captain Kirk.
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"May I speak with you, sir?"
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,A message just came from Starfleet Command.
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,It was class-A security and scrambled.
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,I put it through the decoder.
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,The Federation High Commissioner is on his way to Troyius to attend the royal wedding.
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, no response from the Klingon vessel on any channel."
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"Mister Spock, I'm getting"
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"Come in, please."
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain Kirk, please answer."
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"Oh, Captain, I'm picking up a transmission from inside the Enterprise."
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,It's on a tight beam aimed at the Klingon vessel.
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, message from the Klingon ship."
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,They're ordering us to stand by for boarding or be destroyed.
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"Frequency open, sir."
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,Captain.
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,Message coming in.
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"Channel open, sir."
UHURA,Elaan of Troyius,"Hailing frequency open, sir."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"That's just the negative part, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,I've been over those records.
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"Now the women, they're supposed to be something very special."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"They're supposed to have a kind of subtle, mystical power that drives men wild."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"It was a deep wound, Jim."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"He lost a lot of blood, but he'll recover."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"Well, I've heard of reluctant brides, but this is ridiculous."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,The fat will be in the fire when he learns the bride just tried to murder the groom's ambassador.
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,It'll be a few days.
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"A week, at least, Jim."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,Neck snapped clean.
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,Jim.
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,Jim!
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,May we please have a word with you?
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"Did she cry, Jim?"
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,Did she cry?
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,Did her tears touch you at any time?
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"Oh, we're in trouble."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"Now listen, Jim."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,Petri told Christine that the Elasian women have a sort of a biochemical substance in their tears that acts like a super love potion.
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"And according to him, it doesn't wear off."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"I'll try, but I'll need tests and"
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,Results also negative.
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"It is my time to waste, Ambassador."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"That is the captain's responsibility, Ambassador."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"Spock, I've isolated the biochemical substance of the Elasian tears."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"It's a kind of an infection, and I think I've found an antidote."
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,Are you out of your Vulcan mind?
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,Do you know how long I've worked on
MCCOY,Elaan of Troyius,"Well, I doubt seriously if there's any kind of an antidote for the Enterprise."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,That must wait until the Dohlman is aboard.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,The thing most feared and hated by my people.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,Our most deadly enemy.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,Welcome.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"I am Petri, Ambassador of Troyius."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"Your Glory, I am Petri."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,In the name of my people
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,Please.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"That creature, Elaan, is to be the wife of our ruler to bring peace."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,Our two warring planets now possess the capability of mutual destruction.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,Some method of co-existence must be found.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,Yes.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"But slowly, Captain."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,I will need time.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"Before we reach there, she must be taught civilised manners."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"In her present condition, my people would never accept her."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,Those are my orders.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"I must ask you and your crew to respect, or at least tolerate, their arrogance."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,Friction must be kept at a minimum.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"Another thing you should understand, Captain."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,You have as much at stake as I have.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,Your superiors made the statement that failure of this mission would be as catastrophic for Federation planning as it would be for our two planets.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,To gain peace at the price of accepting such a queen is no victory.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,I will take her the official gifts I bear.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,Perhaps that will soften her mood.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"Your Glory, these are your wedding slippers."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"This, (a sky blue thing) this is your wedding dress, a gift from the bridegroom's mother."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"This, This is the most prized of royal jewels for your lovely neck."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,I explained to Her Glory that her council of nobles and the Troyius Tribunal jointly agreed that I should instruct (pause) make her acquainted with the customs and manners of our people.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, I wish to contact my government."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,I cannot fulfil my mission.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,It would be an insult to our ruler to bring this incorrigible monster as a bride!
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,There cannot be peace between us.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,We have deluded ourselves.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, when I am near them, I do not want peace."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,I want to kill them.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,Job?
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,The job is impossible.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,We cannot make peace with people we detest.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,But if she won't listen to me
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"If I recover, it will be no thanks to you, Captain."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"I should've known better than to talk to her unarmed, but you forced me."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,I hold you responsible for this.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,It's not magic.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,It's biochemical.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,A man whose flesh is once touched by the tears of a woman of Elas has his heart enslaved forever.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,There will be no wedding.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"I would not have our ruler marry that monster if the entire galaxy depended on it, and I will have nothing further to do with you."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"Here you put me, Captain."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,Here I will stay.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,I have nothing further to say to you.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"Doctor, there is no antidote to the poison of Elasian tears."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,The men of Elas have tried desperately for centuries to dispel its power.
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"You're wasting your time, Doctor."
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,Safety?
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"What is your estimate of our chances for survival, Doctor?"
PETRI,Elaan of Troyius,"Now that we are all about to die, I ask you once again to accept this necklace, and to wear it as a token of respect for the desperate wishes of your people and mine for peace."
KRYTON,Elaan of Troyius,There's a Troyian here.
KRYTON,Elaan of Troyius,I must know that all is secure before the Dohlman is brought on board.
KRYTON,Elaan of Troyius,Do honour to the Dohlman of Elas.
KRYTON,Elaan of Troyius,"Glory to Elaan, Dohlman of Elas."
KRYTON,Elaan of Troyius,You may stand.
KRYTON,Elaan of Troyius,Permission to speak was not given.
KRYTON,Elaan of Troyius,He came in answer to your summons.
KRYTON,Elaan of Troyius,Her Glory has not summoned you.
KRYTON,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, you must know I will tell you nothing."
KRYTON,Elaan of Troyius,Our interrogation techniques are more excruciating than you are even capable of.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,You rule this ship?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Your mission is known to us.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain Kirk, you have now permission to show us to our quarters."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,You have not been dismissed.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,You are now dismissed.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Swine!
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Take back your gifts!
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Your ruler cannot buy the favours of the Dohlman of Elas.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I want nothing of his!
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I would strangle if I was to put the gift of a Troyian dog around my neck.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"Kryton, by whose permission did he enter?"
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Quarters!
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,(throws something that breaks)
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Am I a soft Troyian fawn to need pillows to sit on?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,And these ridiculous female trappings.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,They are an offense to my eyes.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"I do not find them so, and I find him even less satisfactory."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Must my bitterness be compounded with that ridiculous ambassador aboard your ship?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Kryton!
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Remove him!
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,And take that garbage with you?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,He dares to suggest that I adopt the servile manners of his people!
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I will never forgive the council for putting me through this torture.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Were you responding to my demand for better quarters?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,You suggest?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I will not be humiliated!
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I did not give you permission to leave!
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"We are interested in how the ship is used in combat, not in what drives it."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Engines are for mechanics and menials.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Do we not have the freedom of this ship?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,We have granted your crew the permission not to kneel in our presence.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,What else do you want?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Courtesy is not for inferiors.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"Kryton, remove that Troyian pig."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"So, Ambassador Petri is going to recover?"
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,That is too bad.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,You have delivered your message.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Now you may go.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"Your Troyian pig was here in my quarters without any permission, so I stabbed him."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Just to be Troyian is enough.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I despise Troyians.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Any contact with them makes me feel soiled.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,It's not in my experience.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Problem?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I have eliminated that problem.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Oh.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,And how do we solve the problem?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"Tell me, what can you teach me?"
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Leave me!
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,You will return me to Elas immediately.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Everything I order is possible.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"I will not go to Troyius, I will not be mated to a Troyian, and I will not be humiliated, and I will not be given to a green pig as a bribe to stop a war!"
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Nobody speaks to me that way.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,You dare touch a member of the royal family.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,The penalty is death for what you are doing.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"You are warned, Captain, never to touch me again."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,You have my leave to go.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"You can teach me nothing, Captain."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"If I have to stay here for ten light years, I will not be soiled by any contact with you."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, there is one thing you can teach me."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I don't know how to make people like me.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I don't want everybody to hate me.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Captain?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Captain.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, that ancient Earth custom called spanking, what is it?"
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Kryton was of a noble family.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,He loved me and wanted to marry me.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,He was furious when he heard of the announcement of the wedding plans.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Probably.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,But why speak of unimportant matters when we can speak about us?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,We should welcome their help.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Could you do that?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Could you give me to another man?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,It was no accident.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"I chose you, and you chose me."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I have a plan.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"With this ship, you could completely obliterate Troyius."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Then there will be no need for the marriage.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"And in gratitude, my people will give you the complete rule of this system."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,He's a Troyian.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"You cannot resist my love, my love."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I want to be by your side.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I love you.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"I have chosen you, and still I don't understand why you didn't fight the Klingon."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,And that mission is to take me to Troyius.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Would you have me wearing my wedding dress for another man and never see you again?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Are you happy at the prospect?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"Yes, my love."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Doctor?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,The Captain asked me to come here for safety.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"That's all you men of other worlds can speak of, duty and responsibility."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I want to die with you.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,They call them radans.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,The necklace is supposed to bring you luck.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,It is of little value.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,They are common stones.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"If I can be of any help, of course."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,But I don't understand you.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,You mean you won't pursue and finish him off?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,You will not beam down for the ceremony?
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,I want you to have this as a personal memento.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,"I have learned that on Troyius, they do not wear such things."
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Remember me.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Nor have I. I have only responsibilities and obligations.
ELAAN,Elaan of Troyius,Goodbye.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Impulse drive, Captain?"
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Lost contact now.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Captain!
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Distant bearing, sir, mark seven three point five."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Bridge to Captain.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, the Klingon ship has changed course."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,It is heading toward us at warp speed.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Phasers ready, sir."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Laid in, Captain."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Aye, sir."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,One hundred thousand kilometres.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Ninety.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Eighty.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Sixty.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Fifty.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,She's passed us without firing a shot.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, the Klingon ship is closing on an intercept course."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Five hundred thousand kilometres.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Deflector shields up.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Three hundred thousand kilometres.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,One hundred thousand kilometres.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Here he comes again, sir."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Sorry, Captain."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,She won't respond fast enough on impulse.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,He's paralleling us again.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,He seems to have broken off the attack.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"He's coming in again, sir."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Aye, sir."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Shields holding, but weakened, sir."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, number four shield just collapsed."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Impulse power down to thirty one percent.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, he's starting his run."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Aye, sir."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Warp power to the shields, Captain?"
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Aye, sir."
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,One hundred thousand kilometres.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Seventy five.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Seventy.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Sixty.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Fifty.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Forty.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Thirty.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,Direct hit amidships by photon torpedo.
SULU,Elaan of Troyius,"Aye, aye, sir."
MAN,Elaan of Troyius,We're only running on impulse engines now.
MAN,Elaan of Troyius,"Ordinarily, we use the warp engines exclusively."
SECURITY,Elaan of Troyius,Security to Captain Kirk.
SECURITY,Elaan of Troyius,"Disturbance in the Dohlman's quarters, sir."
SECURITY,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, it's Ambassador Petri."
SECURITY,Elaan of Troyius,"They refuse to explain what's happening, but"
SECURITY,Elaan of Troyius,"Captain, I'm sorry."
SECURITY,Elaan of Troyius,He seemed
CHAPEL,Elaan of Troyius,"Ambassador, if Elasian women are that vicious, why are men so overwhelmingly attracted to them?"
CHAPEL,Elaan of Troyius,"I mean, what magic do they possess?"
CHAPEL,Elaan of Troyius,Test number twenty four.
CHAPEL,Elaan of Troyius,Colladium trioxide in algobarium solution.
WATSON,Elaan of Troyius,What are you doing?
ELASIAN,Elaan of Troyius,No one may enter the Dohlman's presence.
ELASIAN,Elaan of Troyius,On business.
ELASIAN,Elaan of Troyius,No one may enter the Dohlman's presence.
ELASIAN,Elaan of Troyius,The Dohlman has promised I'll be whipped to death if I let Captain Kirk pass through that door.
CHEKOV,Elaan of Troyius,"Course computed, sir."
CHEKOV,Elaan of Troyius,Photon torpedoes ready.
CHEKOV,Elaan of Troyius,"Aye, Captain."
CHEKOV,Elaan of Troyius,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Elaan of Troyius,"He's badly damaged, Captain."
CHEKOV,Elaan of Troyius,Continuing away at reduced speed.
KLINGON,Elaan of Troyius,"Enterprise, prepare to be boarded or destroyed."
KLINGON,Elaan of Troyius,"Enterprise, our readings confirm your power extremely low, your shields buckling."
KLINGON,Elaan of Troyius,This is your last chance to surrender.
KLINGON,Elaan of Troyius,No terms.
KLINGON,Elaan of Troyius,Surrender must be unconditional and immediate.
KLINGON,Elaan of Troyius,No conditions.
KLINGON,Elaan of Troyius,Surrender immediately.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Look at those pine trees.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,I swear that's honeysuckle I smell.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,What in blazes is that?
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Meadows and no meteor craters.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"The whole place is an enigma, biologically and culturally."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"Why, they look like."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,I'd swear they're American Indians.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"Shouldn't we contact them, Jim?"
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Tell them?
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"What's the matter, Jim?"
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Typical human reaction to an idyllic natural setting.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"Back in the twentieth century, we referred to it as the Tahiti Syndrome."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"It's particularly common to over-pressured leader types, like starship captains."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Yes.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Leaving?
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"You can't be serious, Spock."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,The devil with an asteroid!
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"It won't get here for two months, Spock!"
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"In the meantime, what about Jim?"
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,That may be hours from now.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,He may be injured or dying.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"Can a few more minutes matter, Spock?"
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,What for?
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"It might also cripple the ship, and we would be crushed by the asteroid."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Jim won't be able to get out of its path.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,You sound like you're cutting a diamond.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"Well, Spock, you took your calculated risk in your calculated Vulcan way, and you lost."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"You lost for us, you lost for that planet, and you lost for Jim."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,And my responsibility is the health of this crew.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"You've been driving yourself too hard, and I want you to get some rest."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Back to that planet?
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"Without warp speed, it'll take months, Spock."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Well then what's the use?
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,We might not be able to save the captain even if he still is alive.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"We might not be able to save anything, including this ship!"
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,You haven't heard a word I've said.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,All you've been doing is staring at that blasted obelisk.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,I thought you were reporting to Sickbay.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,You've been trying to do that ever since we started back to that planet.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Fifty eight days.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"Well, you won't read them by killing yourself."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,You've hardly eaten or slept for weeks.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"Now if you don't let up, you're going to collapse."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"Well, your Vulcan metabolism is so low it can hardly be measured, and as for the pressure, that green ice water you call blood"
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"Well, my diagnosis is exhaustion brought on from overwork and guilt."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"You're blaming yourself for crippling this ship, just as we blamed you."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"Well, we were wrong."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,So were you.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,You made a command decision.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Jim would have done the same.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"My prescription is rest, now."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Do I have to call the security guards to enforce it?
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,I prescribed sleep.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Musical notes?
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,You mean it's nothing but a song?
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Were you able to make sense our of the symbols?
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,I've always wondered why there were so many humanoids scattered through the galaxy.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,That's probably how the planet has survived all these centuries.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,The Preservers put an asteroid deflector on the planet.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"And we have to find that deflector and put it back into working order, otherwise"
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,I need Nurse Chapel.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Wife?
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,His brain is unimpaired.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,Everything else is functionally normally except his memory.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,It'd take time.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,We have no choice.
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,What is it?
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,"She had bad internal injuries, Jim."
MCCOY,The Paradise Syndrome,No.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,And that lake.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I swear that's a little orange blossom thrown in.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,It's unbelievable.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Growth exactly like that of Earth on a planet half a galaxy away.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,What are the odds on such duplication?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Analysis, Spock."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Any theories about what it is?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"What's the nearest concentration of life forms, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,And how much time did you say we have to investigate?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,You did say thirty minutes?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Then let's go.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Let's find out what life forms are blessed by this environment.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,It's like discovering Atlantis or Shangri-la.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Mister Spock, is it possible there's a more evolved civilisation somewhere else on this planet, one capable of building that obelisk or developing a deflector system?"
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Tell them what?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,That an asteroid's coming to smash their world into atoms?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,We've got a job to do.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Let's get back to the Enterprise.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,What?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Oh, nothing."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"It's just so peaceful, uncomplicated."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"No problems, no command decisions."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Just living.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Ah, the Tahiti Syndrome."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Let's go take care of that asteroid.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,But first I want another look at that obelisk.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,(standing next to the symbols) Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,(and drops suddenly out of our sight)
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,(dazed and confused) Where am I?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,What place is this?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,What are these?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,(phaser and communicator) I feel should know.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,They're familiar and yet unfamiliar.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,How did I get here?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Who am I?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Try to remember.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Who are you?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"I'll answer anything I can, but as I told you, many things are strange to me."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"I came from the temple, as Miramanee said, and it was a beginning for me here."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"But I came from the sky, too."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Only I can't remember.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I can't remember.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Wait a moment.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,He'll be all right now.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,It's a simple technique.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,It goes way back.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Way back.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Miramanee, tell me about the Wise Ones."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Not this one.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Tell me.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Secrets of the temple.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,The secrets were passed on from father to son?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Well, why doesn't Salish use it?"
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Why are the people in danger?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Ki, Kir"
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"No, no, everything is fine."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Your land is rich, your people happy."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Who could be displeased with that?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I can't tell you anything.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,All I can tell you is that I'm happy and peaceful here.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"I'm not sure, but I think I've never felt that way before."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Why are they so sure I can help them?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Yes, but I. I need time to remember."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,The Joining day?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"No, Miramanee, there's no one else in my mind or my heart."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Name the Joining day.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I have found paradise.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Surely no man has ever attained such happiness.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Get out of my way, Salish."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Nobody's asking for your permission.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I have no intention of striking you dead.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Miramanee.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Come here.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Miramanee.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I'm happy.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I'm so happy.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"If it weren't for the dreams, my mind would be completely at peace."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,They've come back.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"They were gone for a while, but they've come back, and I see faces, too."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Very dim.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I feel I should know know them.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"I feel my place is with them, not here."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I don't deserve this happiness.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,A gift?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,What?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"These last few weeks, my love for Miramanee grows stronger with each passing day."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"However, the dreams return every night."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Fragments of memories.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"I can almost get hold of them, and then"
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,You!
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,A canal.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,And with it we'll bring the water from the lake right to the lodge.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"And we can expand the system, and irrigate the fields and double the food supply."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Lamp.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Preserve.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Preserve.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Oh, no."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"No, no, no, no, no."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"That's not why I made the lamp at all, to keep you forever cooking."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,It's only the wind and the thunder.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Why?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,But it's only the wind.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,The wind can't harm them.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,But I can't do anything about the wind or the sky.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I don't know how to get inside the temple.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,We'll go to the caves.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,It'll be safe there.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Take care of Miramanee.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I am Kirok!
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I have come!
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I am Kirok!
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Miramanee!
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,My wife.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Is she all right?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Miramanee.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,No!
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Miramanee!
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,No!
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Miramanee!
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I am Kirok!
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I am
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,It worked.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Yes.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,What's inside is loaded with scientific equipment.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,McCoy.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I don't know how to get inside.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,The key must be in these symbols.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,We've got to decipher them.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,You mean entry can be gained by playing certain notes on a musical instrument?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Give me your communicator.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Tonal control, consonants and vowels."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I must have hit it accidentally when I contacted the ship.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,(flipping open the communicator) Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Scotty, if the deflector isn't activated within twenty minutes, get out of orbit."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Get the Enterprise out of the danger zone.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,The landing party is expendable.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,The Enterprise isn't.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Miramanee.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Bones, stay with her."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Do what you can.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Careful.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,I must have hit something accidentally.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,A beam caught me and that's when I stopped remembering.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,More symbols.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Can you read them?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Spock, just press the right button."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,How is she?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Will she live?
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"And so are your people, Miramanee."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,If that's what you want.
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,"And I'll love you, Miramanee."
KIRK,The Paradise Syndrome,Always.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Astronomical, Captain."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"The relative size, age and composition of this planet makes it highly improbable that it would evolve similarly to Earth in any way."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,An alien metal of some kind.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,An alloy resistant to probe.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Readings can't even measure its age accurately.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,These incised symbols are fascinating.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Evidently, some form of writing."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Structures of this complexity require extremely sophisticated building apparatus, the kind usually found in cultures surpassing or equalling our own."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Bearing one one seven mark four.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"If we are to divert the asteroid which is on a collision course with this planet, we must warp out of orbit within thirty minutes."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Every second we delay arriving at the deflection point compounds the problem, perhaps past solution."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"They are, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"A mixture of Navajo, Mohican, and Delaware, I believe."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,All among the more advanced and peaceful tribes.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Highly improbable, Captain."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Sensor probes indicate only one type of life form here.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Too primitive to grasp the concept of space flight, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Our appearance here would only confuse and frighten them.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Doctor?
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,I suggest that any further research on your part be delayed until after we have diverted the asteroid.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Prepare to beam us up, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,We're warping out of orbit.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Doctor, that asteroid is almost as large as your Earth's moon."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Far enough away, the angle necessary to divert it enough to avoid destruction is minute, but as the asteroid approaches this planet, the angle becomes so great that even the power of a starship"
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"If we arrive at the deflection point in time, it may not get here at all."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Once the asteroid has been diverted, we'll return here and resume the search."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"(picking up two stoned to illustrate his point) Doctor, assume this is the planet we're on."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,This is the approaching asteroid.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"If we don't get to that deflection point in time, it will become physically impossible to divert this asteroid."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"In that case, everyone on this planet will die, including the captain."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"In the time it's taken me to explain the problem, the asteroid has moved from here to here."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"The longer we delay, the less the likelihood of being able to divert it."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Beam us up, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Stress or not, we cannot reduce speed."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,I do not intend to miss that
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Deflection point.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Objection noted, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Carry on.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Full power, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Then bypass the relays and go to manual control.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"I want full power, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Magnification factor twelve, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,All engines stop.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Hold position here.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Prepare to activate deflectors.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Engineering, maintain full power."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Full power.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Not now.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Activate deflectors.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Degree of deflection, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Recircuit power to engines.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Maximum speed heading three seven mark zero one zero.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Correct, Mister Chekov."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,I intend to retreat in front of that asteroid until we can employ all power on phaser beams.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,To destroy it.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,A narrow beam concentrated on a single spot will split that mass.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Incorrect.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,We'll still be able to get out of its path by use of impulse power.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"That, Doctor, is another calculated risk we must take."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Co-ordinates, Mister Chekov."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,That is our target.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,The asteroid's weakest point.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Lock all phasers on that mark.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Maximum intensity, narrow beam."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,I want to split that fissure wide open.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Very astute, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,We'll fire in sequence and continue firing as long as Mister Scott can maintain power.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Fire phasers.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Rig for simultaneous firing, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Commence simultaneous bombardment.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Estimated repair time?
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,I've already surmised that.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Thank you, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"I accept the responsibility, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Mister Chekov, resume heading eight eight three mark four one."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Exactly fifty nine point two two three days, Doctor, and that asteroid will be four hours behind us all the way."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Another calculated Vulcan risk, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"There isn't time, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,I must decipher those obelisk's symbols.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,They're a highly advanced form of cipher writing.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"I'm aware of that, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"I'm also aware when we arrive at the planet, we'll have barely four hours to effect rescue."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,I believe those symbols are the key.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"I am not hungry, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"And under stress, we Vulcans can do without sleep for weeks."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"My physical condition is not important, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,That obelisk is.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"You prescribed rest, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,The symbols on the obelisk are not words.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,They are musical notes.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"In a way, yes."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Other cultures, among them certain Vulcan offshoots, use musical notes as words."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,The tones correspond roughly to an alphabet.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Yes.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"The obelisk is a marker, just as I thought."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,It was left by a super-race known as the Preservers.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"They passed through the galaxy rescuing primitive cultures which were in danger of extinction and seeding them, so to speak, where they could live and grow."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,So have I.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Apparently the Preservers account for a number of them.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Which has now become defective and is failing to operate.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Precisely, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,We've located the captain.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Beam down Nurse Chapel with an emergency surgical kit.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Hallucinations?
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,The nurse has given you something to ease the pain.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Why were you being stoned?
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Naturally, since he did not come from there."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,: Can you help him?
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Time, Doctor McCoy, is the one thing we do not have in abundance."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,(communicator beeps) Spock here.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Report noted.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Doctor, is he strong enough for the Vulcan mind fusion?"
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,I am Spock.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,You are James Kirk.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Our minds are moving closer.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Closer, closer, closer, James Kirk."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Closer.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,James Kirk.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Our minds are one.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,I am Kir
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Spock!
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,His mind.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,He is an extremely dynamic individual.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Captain, were you inside this structure?"
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,This obelisk is one huge deflector mechanism.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,It is imperative that we get inside immediately.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"Captain, we do not have much time."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"If we are not able to gain entry and activate the deflector mechanism within the next fifty minutes, this entire planet will be destroyed."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"I already have to some extent, Captain."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,They are musical notes.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,That would be one method.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Another would be a series of tonal qualities spoken in their proper sequence.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"If you could remember your exact words, Captain."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"It is similar to deflector panels I've seen, Captain, but far more complicated."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,Probably a memory beam.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,You must have activated it out of sequence.
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,"I do have an excellent eye for musical notes, Captain."
SPOCK,The Paradise Syndrome,They would seem to indicate that this series of relays activated in their proper
CHEKOV,The Paradise Syndrome,"Yes, sir."
CHEKOV,The Paradise Syndrome,Deflection point minus seven.
CHEKOV,The Paradise Syndrome,Deflection point minus four.
CHEKOV,The Paradise Syndrome,"Power dropping, sir."
CHEKOV,The Paradise Syndrome,Zero.
CHEKOV,The Paradise Syndrome,"Deflection point now, sir."
CHEKOV,The Paradise Syndrome,"Power dropping, sir."
CHEKOV,The Paradise Syndrome,"That heading will put us directly in the asteroid's path, sir."
CHEKOV,The Paradise Syndrome,Tau eight point seven.
CHEKOV,The Paradise Syndrome,Beta point zero four one.
CHEKOV,The Paradise Syndrome,"Almost dead centre, sir."
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,Enterprise.
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,"Come in, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,"I can't give you warp nine much longer, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,These engines are beginning to show signs of stress.
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,"All right, but we're moving further into the danger range all the time."
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,If these circuits
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,"The relays will reject the overload, Mister Spock!"
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,We'll burn out the engines!
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,"All right, you lovelies."
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,Hold together.
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,"Full power, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,"All engines stop, sir."
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,"Dilithium crystal circuit's failing, sir."
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,We'll have to replace it.
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,That Vulcan won't be satisfied till these panels are a puddle of lead.
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,My bairns.
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,My poor bairns.
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,"Don't ask for anymore warp nine speeds, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,Our star drive is completely burned out.
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,The only thing we have left is impulse power.
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,Hanging here in space?
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,Forever.
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,The only thing that'll fix these poor darlings is the nearest repair base.
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,"Come in, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,The Paradise Syndrome,"Aye, Captain."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Wait.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,We are your people.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,We've been waiting for you to come to us.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"Salish, a terrible thing has happened."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"The boy was attending the fishnets, and he became entangled in them and sank to the bottom of the river."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"Lumo brought him up quickly, but he doesn't move."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"I must see to the needs of the god, as is my duty."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"There will be no ritual between us now, Salish."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,It is because of tradition that I cannot marry you.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,That was before he came.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,He is medicine chief now.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"Salish, choose another."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Any maiden would be honoured to join with you.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,You have no choice.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Perhaps you would like to bathe now.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Tell?
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,But a god knows everything.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,The Wise Ones brought us here from far away.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,They chose a medicine chief to keep the secret of the temple and to use it when the sky darkens.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,There are no lacings.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,(his uniform top) How is this thing removed?
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Yes.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,How does this open?
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,His father did not wish to share his power too soon.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,He died before he told Salish the secret.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"Well, you came from the stone metal."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Did you not bring life to the child?
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Here there is much time.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,For everything.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,The ritual cloak is finished.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"If it pleases you, I would like to name the Joining day."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,I'm the daughter of the chief.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Tribal law betroths me to our leader.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"If there is another, I will step aside."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,God's wish is above tribal law.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"The sooner our happiness together begins, the longer it will last."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Tomorrow.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,It's a time for joy for all my people.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Each time your arms hold me is as joyous as the first.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"I thought you no longer had the dreams, that you no longer saw the strange lodge which moves through the sky."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,I have a gift for you.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,It may make you happy.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Wait.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,I bear your child.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,And with the power of the lamp.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Lamp?
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"Which turns night into day, we can cook twice as much food, and as you taught us, pre"
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Preserve.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,I act like a stupid child.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,I have nothing to fear.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,You are here.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,(she looks outside) It is time.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,To go to the temple.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,The people will be waiting.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,To save them.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,The wind is only the beginning.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"Soon the sky will darken, the lake will go wild, and the earth will tremble."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Only you can save us.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"If we don't go now, it will be too late."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,You must go inside the temple and make the blue flame come out.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,But you are a god.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"There is nothing you cannot do, my husband."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,No!
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,No!
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Don't hurt him!
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Don't hurt him!
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,He can save us!
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,I belong to him.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Kirok could not get back into the temple.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"I saw him come, come."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,(in pain) Kirok.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,It is true.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,You are safe.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"I knew you would save them, my chief."
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,"When I am better, it will be as it was, will it not?"
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,We will live long and happy lives.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,I will bear you many strong sons.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,I'll love you always.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,Each kiss is as the first.
MIRAMANEE,The Paradise Syndrome,(she dies)
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,"Miramanee has said that you appeared to her and to her handmaiden from the walls of the temple, just as our legend foretells."
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,"We do not doubt the words of our priestess, but these are troubled times, and we must be sure."
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,"It is against custom to interrupt a tribal elder at council, even for the medicine chief."
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,Our skies have darkened three times since the harvest.
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,The last time worst of all.
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,"Our legend predicts such danger and promises that the Wise Ones who planted us here will send a god to save us, one who can rouse the temple spirit and make the sky grow quiet."
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,Can you do this?
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,Wait.
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,My people are grateful.
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,Only a god can breathe life into the dead.
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,Do you still question?
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,Give him the medicine badge.
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,"Our people rejoice and wish to honour your name, but I did not know what you wish to be called."
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,What may I tell them?
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,Kirok?
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,Have we displeased you?
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,"Then it must be ourselves, the way we live."
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,Perhaps we have not improved as quickly as the Wise Ones wish.
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,But there is something.
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,Tell us.
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,We will change it.
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,"You will wait until I walk the holy path to the earth lodge first, to give me time to tell the priestess that you follow and that the Joining will take place."
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,(bursting in) Kirok!
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,Kirok!
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,"When the ground trembles the caves are not safe, Kirok."
ELDER,The Paradise Syndrome,"If you do not rouse the temple spirit, we will all die."
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,He knows nothing of our danger.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,How could he save us?
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,"Elder, words will not save us when the skies darken."
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,We must be certain.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,I say he must prove he is a god.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,There is no sound in the body.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,There is no light in the eyes.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,He will move no more.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,Miramanee.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,What are you doing?
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,You should be working on our ritual cloak.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,What do you mean?
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,We cannot go against tradition.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,But you are promised to me.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,Tribal priestess and medicine chief are always joined.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,I wish no other.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,"Miramanee, if you could choose, would you choose me?"
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,"Even though you be a god, Kirok, I cannot permit this Joining."
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,Then you must strike me dead.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,You bleed.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,"You bleed, Kirok."
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,Behold a god who bleeds!
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,Behold a god who bleeds!
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,Kill me.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,"Kill me, Kirok, for I will not rest until I prove to my people that you are no god."
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,"Why are you not at the temple, Kirok?"
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,Soon the ground will begin to tremble.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,The people need your help.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,The caves?
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,Surely a legend can do more than that for his people.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,"Well, what do you wait for, god?"
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,Your robes?
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,There's the false one!
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,He's false!
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,Then go.
SALISH,The Paradise Syndrome,Go die with your false god.
SULU,The Paradise Syndrome,"Aye, sir."
SULU,The Paradise Syndrome,"Aye, sir."
SULU,The Paradise Syndrome,"Not enough, Mister Spock."
SULU,The Paradise Syndrome,It's only point zero zero one three degrees.
SULU,The Paradise Syndrome,"Aye, sir."
SULU,The Paradise Syndrome,"All phasers locked, sir."
SULU,The Paradise Syndrome,"Standing by, sir."
SULU,The Paradise Syndrome,Phaser one firing.
SULU,The Paradise Syndrome,Phaser two firing.
SULU,The Paradise Syndrome,Phaser four firing.
SULU,The Paradise Syndrome,"All phasers fired, sir."
SULU,The Paradise Syndrome,"Tracking report, sir."
SULU,The Paradise Syndrome,Sixty five minutes to end of safety margin.
ENGINEER,The Paradise Syndrome,"Main relay's out again, Mister Scott."
WOMAN,The Paradise Syndrome,This joining means the end of darkness.
ALL,The Paradise Syndrome,(They throw their stones at Kirk.)
ALL,The Paradise Syndrome,Die!
ALL,The Paradise Syndrome,Die!
ALL,The Paradise Syndrome,Die!
ALL,The Paradise Syndrome,You'll be killed!
ALL,The Paradise Syndrome,Kill him!
ALL,The Paradise Syndrome,We're all doomed!
ALL,The Paradise Syndrome,"Die, impostor!"
ALL,The Paradise Syndrome,You lied to us!
ALL,The Paradise Syndrome,You're not a god!
ALL,The Paradise Syndrome,We'll kill you now!
CHAPEL,The Paradise Syndrome,Does he recognise us?
BOTH,The Paradise Syndrome,I am Kirok.
BOTH,The Paradise Syndrome,I am Kirok.
CHEKOV,The Enterprise Incident,"I have completed the assignment, Captain."
CHEKOV,The Enterprise Incident,A theoretical incursion into
CHEKOV,The Enterprise Incident,You're alive!
CHEKOV,The Enterprise Incident,"Captain, your ears."
CHEKOV,The Enterprise Incident,What happened?
CHEKOV,The Enterprise Incident,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,The Enterprise Incident,Romulans and Vulcans appear to read almost exactly alike.
CHEKOV,The Enterprise Incident,There is just a slight difference which.
CHEKOV,The Enterprise Incident,"Got him, sir."
CHEKOV,The Enterprise Incident,"Sir, transporter room has the co-ordinates and is ready for beaming."
CHEKOV,The Enterprise Incident,"Entering Neutral Zone, Captain."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Yes, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"I can read, and as usual your theoretical evaluations do not tally with mine."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Return to your duty and I'll let you know when your work is satisfactory.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Full sensor scan of the region, please."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Yes, Mister Spock, that was the past."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I'm concerned with the present.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Or is it becoming too much for this crew to present me current information?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Then, Mister Spock, comply."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Very well.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Change course.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Come about to one eight five, mark three."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Yes, very perceptive, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I know where the course change takes us.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Execute.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Better and better, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Very well, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"If you two have complaints, you can bring them out into the open."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Sound Red Alert.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Man battle stations.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Stand by main phasers.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Lieutenant Uhura, code a message to Starfleet Command."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Advise them of our situation.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Include all log entries to this point.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Mister Spock, your sensors read clear."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,What happened?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Put it on the main viewing screen, Lieutenant, and complete that message to Starfleet Command."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Your information is correct.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,This is Captain Kirk.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Lieutenant.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"(mutes sound) They want something, or they would have destroyed us by now."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"It's my ship they want, and very badly."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Lieutenant.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,(sound on) Save your threats.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"If you board this ship, I'll blow it up."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,You'll gain nothing.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"My first officer, Commander Spock."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,You understand that Starfleet Command has been advised of the situation?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,The design of the ship is the same.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Mister Spock, you said you had a theory on why your sensors didn't pick up the new ships until they were upon us."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"If so, Romulans could attack in Federation territory before we knew they were there, before a vessel or planet could get even begin to get their defences up."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Well, that's a brilliant observation, Mister Scott."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Do you have any other helpful opinions?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,We have three.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"We can fight and be destroyed, or we can destroy the Enterprise ourselves and keep her from the Romulans."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Or we can surrender.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Opinions, gentlemen."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Dismissed, Doctor."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I said dismissed.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Put them on the screen.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Put him on.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Why should we walk right into your hands?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,What guarantee do we have they'll beam aboard our ship once we're on yours?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Give us your transporter co-ordinates.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,We're beaming aboard.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"One final order, Engineer Scott."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"If we do not return, the Enterprise must not be taken."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"If the Romulans attempt it, you're to fight, and if necessary, destroy yourselves."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Is that clear?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Energise.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Commander.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I'm honoured.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Instrument failure caused navigational error.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"We were across the Neutral Zone before we realised it, then we were surrounded by your ships before we could get back."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Accidents happen.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Cut off back-up systems malfunction.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,We were due for overhaul two months ago.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,The error was corrected.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"We were not spying, Commander."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,You're grossly mistaken if you think we were there
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,What earns Spock your special interest?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,You've been told everything.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,There's nothing else to say.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"We've been all through that, Commander!"
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Let her rant.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,There's nothing to say.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,That's a lie!
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Shut up, Spock!"
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,You filthy liar!
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"(having to be held back by the guards) I'll kill you, you filthy traitor!"
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I'll kill you!
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I'll kill you!
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Did you hear that, you coward?"
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,You've betrayed everything of value you ever knew.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Did you hear the sound of human integrity?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,You traitor.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I'll kill you.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I'll kill you.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I'll kill you!
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Oh.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,(sitting up) My neck feels like it's been twisted off.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Ah, but the Romulans don't know that."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Sure fooled the doctors.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"As far as the rest of the crew's concerned, I'm still dead."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,That's what this whole masquerade was about.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,To keep the Enterprise and the Federation off the hook.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Bones, I want you to prepare for surgery."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Yes.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Are those Romulan officers still aboard the ship?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I'll need a Romulan uniform.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I wish I knew.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Scotty, are you sure we have a clear channel to Spock?"
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Then we can't wait any longer.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Prepare to beam me aboard the flagship.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"It can't be helped, Scotty."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Just don't put me inside a bulkhead.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Energise.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I've just effected an escape from the Federation vessel.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I have important information for Sub-commander Tal.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Where is he?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Good.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I shall remember to mention your alertness to him.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Return to your duty.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"I'm already on board, Spock."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Do you have the information?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Spock, I'll get the cloaking device."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Will you be able to get back to the Enterprise without attracting their attention?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,There's an intruder aboard.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Has someone tried to gain entrance there?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Over there!
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,There's an enemy spy aboard.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,He'll be after the cloaking device.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Scotty, energise."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,We'll just have to hope he can buy us enough time to get this cloaking device installed.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Can you do it?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"You have fifteen minutes, Scotty."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,The report was premature.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,We'll discuss it later.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Mister Sulu, lay in a course for home."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Mister Chekov, take the sensors."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Mister Spock is still aboard the Romulan flagship.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I want his body readings pinpointed and isolated.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"That was not a request, gentlemen."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Mister Chekov, there's only one Vulcan aboard that ship."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,He should be easy enough to locate.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Feed the co-ordinates to the transporter room on the double.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Have them prepare to beam him aboard on my signal.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Go ahead, Scotty."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Stand by, Scotty."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Transporter room, beam Mister Spock aboard."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,The commander?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,All right.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Have them report to the Bridge on the double.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Mister Sulu, take us away from the Romulans."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Warp factor nine.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Scotty, throw the switch on that device."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Lieutenant, open a channel to the Romulan vessel."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Establish two-way visual contact.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,This is Captain Kirk.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Hold your fire.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,We have your commander aboard.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Break contact!
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Scotty, we're running out of time."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Mister Spock, distance from the Romulan vessel?"
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Stand by, phasers."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Commander, you'll forgive me if I put up a fight."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Scotty.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Throw the switch.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Throw the switch.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Mister Sulu, come about."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Three one eight mark seven.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Cancel Red Alert.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,We'll let you off at the nearest Federation outpost.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Mister Spock will have the honour of escorting you to your quarters.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,Commander.
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Very good, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"Thank you, Mister Leslie."
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,"What is it, Bones?"
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,What for?
KIRK,The Enterprise Incident,I'm on my way.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I did give a full report
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Sensor scan to one half parsec.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Increasing sensor scan to one parsec.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,All scanners report clear.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Nothing in our immediate vicinity.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Intelligence reports Romulans now using Klingon design.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,A second ship has appeared.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"(another one decloaks) Correction, there are now three."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,We are surrounded.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"I have a theory, Captain."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"True, Captain."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,That would be standard Romulan procedure.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,It would be a great prize.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I believe the Romulans have developed a cloaking device which renders our tracking sensors useless.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"If we had not crossed the Neutral Zone, on your order, you would not now need our opinions to support a decision which should never have had to be made."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Spock.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I understand.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Starfleet is not in the habit of informing Romulans of its ships' personnel.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,It is no myth.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I reserve the privilege of speaking only when it will not violate my honour as a Vulcan.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"You're being clever, Commander."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,That is unworthy of a Romulan.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,It is not a lie to keep the truth to oneself.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"You would not resort to them, Commander."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,They would prove ineffective against the captain.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I cannot allow the captain to be further destroyed.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,The strain of command has worn heavily upon him.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,He's not been himself for several weeks.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"As you can see, Captain Kirk is a highly sensitive and emotional person."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I believe he has lost the capacity for rational decision.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I'm betraying no secrets.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,The commander's suspicion that Starfleet ordered the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone is unacceptable.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Our rapid capture demonstrates its foolhardiness.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I am speaking the truth for the benefit of the Enterprise and the Federation.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"I say now and for the record, that Captain Kirk ordered the Enterprise across the Neutral Zone on his own initiative and his craving for glory."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,He is not sane.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I am half Vulcan.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,My mother is a human.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Vulcan.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Eighteen years.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,The question is irrelevant.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,My duty as an officer is to obey him.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I do not desire a ship of my own.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Such opportunities are extremely rare.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,That thought has occasionally crossed my mind.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"Commander, shall we speak plainly?"
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,It is you who desperately need a ship.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,You want the Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Indeed.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"I am honoured, Commander."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Are the guards also invited?
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Of course.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I shall obey your restrictions.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,It would be illogical to assume that all conditions remain stable.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I am ready.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"The matter is not open for discussion, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"There is no alternative, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,The safety of the crew is now the paramount issue.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,It is misguided loyalty to resist any further.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I was unprepared for his attack.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I instinctively used the Vulcan death grip.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"I am very flattered, Commander."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,There's no doubt that the cuisine aboard your vessel is far superior to that of the Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,It is indeed a very powerful recruiting inducement.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,A place?
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I was not aware of that aspect of Romulan society.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Please believe me.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I do appreciate it.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"Yes, of course, but not just this moment."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,An hour from now will do even better.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"Would it not, Commander?"
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I was beginning to wonder.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"How rare, and how beautiful."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,But so incongruous when spoken by a soldier.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Spock to Captain Kirk.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Captain
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Are you prepared to beam over?
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,The cloaking device is in an area near the commander's quarters.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,It is closely guarded and off-limits to all but authorised personnel.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,What is your present location?
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"Unknown, Captain."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"At present, I am rather heavily"
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"Commander, your attire is not only more appropriate, it should actually stimulate our conversation."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I must confess that I too am moved emotionally.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I know it is illogical.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"That will be profitless, Commander."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I do not believe you will find it.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I assure you I am quite sane.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,First officer of the Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"(Broken-hearted, she slaps his face.)"
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,What is your present form of execution?
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I demand the Right of Statement first.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Thank you.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I shall not require much time.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"No more than twenty minutes, I should say."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,My crime is sabotage.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I freely admit my guilt.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,(Scott is continuing to work) The oath I swore as a Starfleet officer is both specific and binding.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"As long as I wear the uniform, my duty is to protect the security of the Federation."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"Clearly, your new cloaking device is a threat to that security."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I carried out my duty.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,There is no regulation regarding the content of my statement.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,May I continue?
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"Beyond the historic tradition of Vulcan loyalty, there is also the combined Romulan-Vulcan history of obedience to duty."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"One hundred and fifty thousand kilometres, Captain, and closing very rapidly."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,One hundred thousand kilometres.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,They should commence firing at us within the next twelve point seven seconds.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"The cloaking device is working perfectly, and the commander has informed me that even the Romulan sensors cannot track a vessel so equipped."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Deck two.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,It is regrettable that you were made an unwilling passenger.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,It was not intentional.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,All the Federation wanted was the cloaking device.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,It was my only interest when I boarded your vessel.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"You underestimate yourself, Commander."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Obviously.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Military secrets are the most fleeting of all.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,I hope that you and I exchanged something more permanent.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,It was the only choice possible.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,You would not respect any other.
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,"Captain, please go."
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,Somehow they do not look aesthetically agreeable
SPOCK,The Enterprise Incident,On humans.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"I can find no reason for the captain's behaviour, except possibly that we've been on patrol too long without relief and diversion."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,He has resisted all of my attempts to run a psychological profile on him.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"Jim, you ordered us?"
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,You had no authority!
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,Jim!
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,McCoy here.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,I don't make house calls.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"He'll recover, but he'll need further attention."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,Inform your superior.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,McCoy.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,Chief medical officer.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"Well, you can see for yourself, he's mentally depressed, physically weak, disoriented, displays feelings of persecution and rebellion."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"No, not now."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"Yes, it's possible."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"Spock, I don't believe it."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,There's no price you could pay that would make him sell out.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"What do you mean, the matter's not open for discussion?"
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,What did you do?
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,What did you do?
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"Your instincts are still good, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,The captain is dead.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,I left orders that no one come in here.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"Well now that you know it, you might as well assist me."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,Hand me the physiostimulator.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,Spock gave him a nerve pinch to simulate death.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,I didn't know it until I beamed aboard the Romulan ship.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,Jim and Spock were operating under Federation orders.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,That's the Vulcan death grip for you.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,You took a big chance they didn't start an autopsy.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"So that if anything went wrong, you would be the one to blame."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,What for?
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,Sickbay to Bridge.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"Mister Scott, will you report to Sickbay."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,You have to.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,It's urgent.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"Well, I do."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"Mister Scott, please."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,What the devil is Spock doing?
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,What's delaying him?
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"You're taking an awful chance, Jim."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,Sickbay to Bridge.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"Well, if all the shouting's over up there, I'd like for you to report to Sickbay."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"Well, you're due in surgery."
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,I'm going to bob your ears.
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,"Well, are you coming, Jim?"
MCCOY,The Enterprise Incident,Or do you want to go through life looking like your First Officer?
SULU,The Enterprise Incident,"Maintaining course and speed, sir."
SULU,The Enterprise Incident,"But, sir, that'll lead us directly into the Romulan Neutral Zone."
SULU,The Enterprise Incident,"Aye, sir."
SULU,The Enterprise Incident,"Captain, leaving Neutral Zone."
SULU,The Enterprise Incident,Now entering Romulan space.
SULU,The Enterprise Incident,Captain!
SULU,The Enterprise Incident,"Aye, sir."
SULU,The Enterprise Incident,"Holding at warp nine, sir."
SULU,The Enterprise Incident,"Three one eight mark seven, sir."
SULU,The Enterprise Incident,Executing.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"Lieutenant, when did the order come through?"
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,From Starfleet.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,The order to enter the Neutral Zone.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,Surely the Captain couldn't be doing this on his own authority.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,That's a Klingon ship!
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"But it couldn't be, not in this area."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,They caught us right enough.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,We've not got many choices.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"If the Enterprise is taken by Romulans, they'll know everything there is to know about a starship."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,Perfectly clear.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"Security, put our two Romulan hostages in the brig."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"Lieutenant Uhura, give me a channel to that ship."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,This is Lieutenant Commander Scott.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"The Enterprise takes no orders, except those of Captain"
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"Kirk, And we will stay right here until he returns."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"And if you make any attempt to board or commandeer the Enterprise, it will be blown to bits along with as many of you as we can take with us."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"Scott here, Doctor."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,Sickbay?
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,I can't leave the bridge at a time like this.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,We're surrounded by enemy vessels ready to attack us.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,I don't know of anything more urgent than that.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"All right, Doctor."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,It better be important.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,Scott out.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"All right, Doctor, what's so urgent that... Captain?"
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"Well, you look like the devil himself, but as long as you're alive."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,What's it all about?
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"They're in the brig, sir."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,No doubt of it.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,But Mister Spock hasn't sent the proper co-ordinates yet.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"But, sir, what about Mister Spock?"
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,It'll have to hook into our deflector shield control.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"I don't know, sir."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"I've got that device installed, but bless me if I know whether it'll work."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,It's the biggest guess I've ever made.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"I did, sir."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,It's not working.
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"Captain, I'm working as fast as I can."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,"It's ready now, Captain, but I don't know whether our circuits can handle this alien contraption."
SCOTT,The Enterprise Incident,It'll likely overload.
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,Order?
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"There's been no order I know of, Mister Scott."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,Battle stations.
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"All hands, battle stations."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"Captain Kirk, I'm receiving a class two signal from the Romulan vessel."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"The Romulan vessel is signalling again, sir."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"Channel is open, Mister Scott, and you are tied in."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,Bridge to Doctor McCoy.
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"Doctor, you must beam aboard the Romulan flagship immediately."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,There's been an injury.
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"Doctor, it's Captain Kirk!"
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"They said you'd been killed, sir."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,Captain Kirk.
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"Mister Scott is on the intercom for you, sir."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"Transporter room reports Mister Spock aboard, sir, and the Romulan commander."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,The Enterprise Incident,"I have Sub-commander Tal, sir."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"(a thin male) You have been identified as the star ship Enterprise, Captain James T. Kirk last known to be in command."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,I am Sub-commander Tal of the Romulan fleet.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"Your ship is surrounded, Captain."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"You will surrender immediately, or we will destroy you."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,Who is that beside you?
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,Vulcan.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"(his communicator beeps and he answers it) Yes, Commander."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"Yes, Commander."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"No one should decide quickly to die, Captain."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,We give you one of your hours.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"If you do not surrender your ship at the end of that time, your destruction is certain."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,We will be open to communication should you wish it.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,The subspace message will take three weeks to reach Starfleet.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"The decision is yours, Captain."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,One hour.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"My commander wishes to speak with you, Captain Kirk."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,The commander wishes to see you and your first officer aboard this vessel.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,It is felt this matter requires discussion.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,Two of my officers will beam aboard your vessel as exchange hostages while you are here.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"Granted, we do not easily trust each other, Captain, but you are the ones who violated our territory."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,Should it not be we who distrust your motives?
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"However, we agree to simultaneous exchange."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,Alien?
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,Are you certain?
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,I must know the source!
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,Commander?
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,Permission to enter.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"It is urgent, Commander."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"Commander, we have intercepted an alien transmission."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"We have, Commander."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,This room.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"Commander, the cloaking device is gone."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,Alert all vessels.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"Weapons officer, bring main batteries to bear on the Enterprise."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"We have you under our weapons, Enterprise."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,You cannot escape.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,Commander?
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"Helmsman, flank speed."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"Weapons officer, stand by to fire main batteries as soon as we reach optimum range."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"Weapons officer, commence fire."
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,(sees Enterprise disappear) Gone.
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,They have the cloaking device!
TAL,The Enterprise Incident,"Quickly, compute enemy course from last position and open fire!"
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Captain Kirk.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"I don't think so, but we have an important matter to discuss."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,And your superficial courtesies are an overture to that discussion.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You are the first officer?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,I speak first with the Captain.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You may wait outside.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"The matter of trespass into Romulan space is one of galactic import, a violation of treaties."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Now I ask you simply, what is your mission here?"
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,A starship?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,One of the Starfleet's finest vessels?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You're saying instrument failure as radical as you suggest went unnoticed until you were well past the Neutral Zone?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,I see.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,But you were able to navigate with this malfunction?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,But I doubt it'll clear you of espionage.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Your language has always been most difficult for me, Captain."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Perhaps you have another word for it.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Captain, if a Romulan vessel ventured far into Federation territory without good explanation, what would a starbase commander do?"
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"You see, it works both ways."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,I hardly believe you are the injured party.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Spock, come in."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,The captain has made his statement.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"I must admit some surprise on seeing you, Spock."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,We were not aware of Vulcans aboard the Enterprise.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Quite so.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Yet there are certain ships, certain officers, that are known to us."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Your situation appears most interesting.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,He is a Vulcan.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Our forebears had the same roots and origins.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Something you wouldn't understand, Captain."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"We can appreciate the Vulcans, our distant brothers."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,I have heard of Vulcan integrity and personal honour.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"There's a well-known saying, or is it a myth, that Vulcans are incapable of lying?"
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Then tell me truthfully now, by your honour as a Vulcan, what was your mission?"
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,It is unworthy of a Vulcan to resort to subterfuge.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Then there is a truth here that remains unspoken.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,There is Mister Spock's unspoken truth.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You knew of the cloaking device that we have developed.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"You deliberately violated Romulan space with a blatant spy mission, by order of the Federation."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,We have not even begun!
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,There's no force that I can use on a Vulcan that will make him speak.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,That is a fact.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,But there are Romulan methods completely effective against humans and human weaknesses.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Then they will leave him dead, or what might be worse than dead."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,But I will know your unspoken truths.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,(into comm.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"system) Attention, Enterprise, I am speaking to you from the Romulan flagship."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"The USS Enterprise, under command of Captain James T. Kirk, is formally charged with espionage."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,The testimony of First Officer
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Spock was highly instrumental in confirming this intrusion into Romulan space was not an accident.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,First Officer Spock's testimony was specific that your ship was not under orders from Starfleet Command or the Federation council to perform such a spy mission.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,It was Captain Kirk who was solely responsible.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Since the crew had no choice but to obey orders, the crew will not be held responsible."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Therefore, I am ordering Engineer Scott, presently in command of the Enterprise, to follow the Romulan flagship"
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,To our home base.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You will there be processed and released to Federation Command.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Until judgment is passed, Captain Kirk will be held in confinement."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You humans make a brave noise.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,There are ways to convince you of your errors.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Take him to the security room.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,A Vulcan among humans.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Living, working with them."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,I would think the situation would be intolerable to you.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,To whom is your allegiance then?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Do you call yourself Terran or Vulcan?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"How long have you been a Starfleet officer, Spock?"
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,And you serve Captain Kirk.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Do you like him?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Do you like your shipmates?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Possibly, but you are subordinate to Captain Kirk's orders, even to his whims."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You are a superior being.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Why do you not command?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Or is it that no one has offered you, a Vulcan, that opportunity?"
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"For someone with your capabilities and accomplishments, opportunities are made and will be."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"I will see to that, if you'll stop looking on the Federation as the whole universe."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"It is not, you know."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You must have your own ship.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Of course.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,It would be a great achievement for me to bring home the Enterprise intact.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,It would broaden the scope of my powers greatly.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,It would be the achievement of a lifetime.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,And it would open equal opportunities for you.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Yes?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,I'll come there.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Attend me.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"I neglected to mention, I'll expect you for dinner."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,We have much to discuss.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Allow me to rephrase.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Will you join me for dinner?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Mister Spock.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,That corridor is forbidden to all but loyal Romulans.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,I hope that one day there will be no need for you to observe any restrictions.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Are you the doctor?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Captain Kirk's condition?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Then by your own standards of normality, this man is not fully competent."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Mister Spock has stated that he believes the captain had no authority or order to cross the Neutral Zone.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Could this mental incapacity have afflicted him earlier?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Mister Spock, the doctor has now confirmed your testimony as to the mental state of your captain."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,He was and is unfit to continue in command of the Enterprise.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,That duty has fallen on you.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Are you ready to exercise that function?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"That's enough, Doctor."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"As a physician, your duty is to save lives."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Mister Spock's duty is to lead the Enterprise and its crew to a safe haven.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,I've had special Vulcan dishes prepared for you.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,I hope they're to your liking.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,We have other inducements.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You have nothing in Starfleet to which to return.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"I offer, we offer you an alternative."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"We will find a place for you, if you wish it."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,With me.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Romulan women are not like Vulcan females.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,We are not dedicated to pure logic and the sterility of non-emotion.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Our people are warriors.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Often savage.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,But we are also many other pleasant things.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"As a Vulcan, you would study it."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,As a human you would find ways to appreciate it.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,I am so glad.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Now one final step to make the occasion complete.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"You will lead a small party of Romulans aboard the Enterprise, and there you will take your rightful place as its commander."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"And you will lead the ship to a Romulan port, with my flagship at its side."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Yes.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Yes, it will, Mister Spock."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You do know I have a first name.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Well, I do."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Would you like to hear it?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"If you will give me a moment, the soldier will transform herself into a woman."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Is my attire now more appropriate, Mister Spock?"
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,It's hard to believe that I can be so moved by the touch of an alien hand.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Mister Spock, we mustn't question what we truly feel."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Accept what is happening between us, even as I do."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Not now, Tal."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Enter.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Locate its source.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,The cloaking device.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Bring him.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Full alert.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Search all decks.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You must be mad.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Why would you do this to me?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,What are you that you could do this?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Return to your station, Sub-commander."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,The boarding action on the Enterprise will begin with my command.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"If they resist, destroy her."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Execution of state criminals is both painful and unpleasant.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,I believe the details are unnecessary.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,The sentence will be carried out immediately after the charges have been recorded.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You understand Romulan tradition well.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,The right is granted.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"It should take less time than that to find your ally, who stole the cloaking device."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You will not die alone.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Recording the Romulan Right of Statement.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"Proceed, Commander Spock."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Everyone carries out his duty.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"You state the obvious, Spock."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Very well.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Your twenty minutes is almost up.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"I would give you credit, Captain, for getting this far."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,But you will be dead in a moment and the credit would be gratuitous.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Destroy this vessel.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,I gave you a direct command!
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Tal!
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"You see, Captain?"
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Your effort is being wasted.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Of course.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,It's expected.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"You are very generous, Captain."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,"If I may be taken to your brig, I will take my place as your prisoner."
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,Captain.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,The Federation.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,And what did you want?
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,And that's exactly all you came away with.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,You realise that very soon we will learn to penetrate the cloaking device you stole.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,It was your choice.
COMMANDER,The Enterprise Incident,It will be our secret.
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,"(The body of Kirk lies on a bed, bathed in green light."
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,"McCoy exits through one door, and Chapel enters through the other."
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,Kirk's eyes open.)
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,Doctor!
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,Doctor McCoy!
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,(Kirk's eyes shut again.
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,The heart monitor starts thumping.)
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,Doctor McCoy!
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,"But he's alive, alive!"
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,But he was dead.
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,Their doctors certified he was dead.
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,"Then Mister Spock isn't a traitor, and you knew that and you didn't"
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,There's no such thing as a Vulcan death grip.
CHAPEL,The Enterprise Incident,: Why?
ROMULAN,The Enterprise Incident,Centurion.
ROMULAN,The Enterprise Incident,"I'm sorry, no one is allowed"
ROMULAN,The Enterprise Incident,"He's in control central, sir."
ROMULAN,The Enterprise Incident,"Thank you, Centurion."
ROMULAN,The Enterprise Incident,Halt.
ROMULAN,The Enterprise Incident,Don't move.
ROMULAN,The Enterprise Incident,Who are you?
ROMULAN,The Enterprise Incident,What are you doing in here?
ROMULAN,The Enterprise Incident,Drop your weapon.
OFFICER,The Enterprise Incident,Sub-commander Tal.
OFFICER,The Enterprise Incident,"I'm receiving an alien transmission from within our vessel, sir."
OFFICER,The Enterprise Incident,"Yes, Sub-commander."
OFFICER,The Enterprise Incident,"Triangulating now, sir."
OFFICER,The Enterprise Incident,"Sub-commander, the enemy vessel is moving away at extreme speed, sir."
OFFICER,The Enterprise Incident,"Yes, sir."
GUARD,The Enterprise Incident,"Centurion, have you clearance for this area?"
GUARD,The Enterprise Incident,I do not recognise you.
GUARD,The Enterprise Incident,"I must see your authorisation, sir."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Professor Starnes?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"(the man has a phaser, and looks terrified.)"
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,It's Kirk.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,He didn't seem to know me.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Self-inflicted.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,All this.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Self-inflicted.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Mass suicide.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Kirk of the starship Enterprise.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,No sign of grief?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Or of fear.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,And you insist their behaviour indicates traumatic shock?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,A child suppresses the fact that both parents are dead?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I can't believe it.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Not these children, to this extent."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,It's incredible.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I'll be guided by that opinion, Doctor, for the present."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,What about questioning them?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Accepted, Doctor."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Careful.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Children.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Children, listen to me."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,It's late and it's time to go up to the ship.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm sorry.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm sorry.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,You'll go up with the doctor.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Whatever happened here is locked up inside those children.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Attack?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Mass suicide is what it seems to be.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Such as?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,What would make the children immune?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Then the children would have been exempted by conscious design.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,And their present behaviour explained by a fear of punishment.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,SPOCK: Or the promise of reward.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,An attack by an unknown assailant on an uninhabited planet.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"This planet is uninhabited, Mister Spock, to the best of our information?"
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Getting a reading?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Picking up any life-forms, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"(shivers) Oh, that's strange."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,That's very strange.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm getting a feeling of anxiety in this place.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"It doesn't sound very scientific, does it?"
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,But it's strongest right here.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Maybe that's what's registering on your tricorder.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"No, of course."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"That's, that's me."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,That's me.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,But what's causing your tricorder to react?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Yes, I'm fine."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm fine.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Just some sympathetic vibration with what happened here.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Let's get back to the ship.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I want to check out those tapes from Professor Starnes' tricorder.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,And I am going to question those children.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,There has to be an answer.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,We're not leaving here until we find out what went on or what's going on.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"It could be far worse for them if I don't, and for us too."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Well, well, well."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"You're all having such a good time, I think I'll join you."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Is that all right?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I'll have a dish, too."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,A little one.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,A very small one.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"It's better than Triacus, isn't it?"
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I don't think your parents liked it very much either.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm sure your parents loved you.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,That's why they took you with them to Triacus.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,So they wouldn't be so far away from you for such a long time.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,That would make them very unhappy and miss you.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I'm sure that you would miss them, too."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Now wait a minute.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"No, I don't think so."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,It'll spoil your dinner.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"All right, children, you've had a busy day."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I think you could use some rest.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Nurse Chapel will see you to your quarters.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Tommy, Just a moment."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'd like to ask you a question.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Come and sit down.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Tommy, will you tell me what you saw?"
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"In the cave, on the planet."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,On Triacus.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Did you see your father today?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Did he seem upset?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,What about?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,What was going on that would have upset him?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I'm not upset with you, Tommy, or your friends."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,We invited you aboard the Enterprise.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Why would I do that if I didn't like you?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Aren't you unhappy about leaving Triacus?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Aren't you upset about leaving your parents?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Yes, certainly."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'll take you.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Kirk to security.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Post a guard on the children.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,They're to be kept under constant watch.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Lieutenant Uhura, any report from the planet security team?"
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Good.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Let's see them.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Let's see some more of these unscientific hypotheses, Mister Spock."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,What happened?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I didn't see you come in, Tommy."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,No.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,We'll probably take you to a Federation Starbase.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I'm sorry, Tommy."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Marcos Twelve is not within our patrol area.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Mister Spock, we'll pursue this in my quarters."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"All right, Tommy."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Lieutenant, have Doctor McCoy report to my quarters for a brief conference."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Mister Leslie?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,That could be what destroyed him.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Misleading the innocent?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I wonder.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Yes, Doctor."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Spock what do we know about the race that lived here?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Is that the end of it?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Is it possible that the evil found the catalyst?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"But most legends have their basis in fact, Spock."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I understand your diagnosis, Doctor, and I'll respect it."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,But not to the exclusion and safety of the Enterprise.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Thank you.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Spock, what other expeditions have visited Triacus?"
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,What was it Professor Starnes said about the unseen force?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,A ship.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Yes, a ship for Triacus."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,But why?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,By whom?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,(into comm.)
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Security detachment.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Ready for relief duty on Triacus.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Assemble in the transporter room immediately.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'll have some questions for that planet detachment as soon as they're beamed up.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I think it's about time we found out whether Professor Starnes' enemy within is on the planet below or here onboard ship with us.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Come on.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Your tour of duty will last one hour.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Be prepared with your communicators at all times to report any alien beings.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Don't wait to investigate.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Beam up the security detachment from Triacus.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,(no one appears) Spock?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,What's wrong?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Why not?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,That's impossible.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"If we're not orbiting Triacus, then the men I beamed down are dead."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Activate the bridge monitor screen.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Captain to Bridge.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Mister Sulu, we're not orbiting Triacus."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,You're off course.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm coming right up.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Sulu!
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Helmsman, disregard what you see on the screen, what you think you see on the screen."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Set a course for Starbase Four.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Helmsman, did you hear me?"
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starbase Four."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Tell them we're bringing the children there.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Tell Starfleet Command I suspect them of being alien in nature, and I want a thorough investigation made upon our arrival."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Lieutenant, what are you staring at?"
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Lieutenant, there's nothing there."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Mister Spock, you make the call to Starfleet."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Mister Sulu, I ordered you to change course."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Mister Sulu
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Mister Sulu, there's nothing there."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"That was an order, Spock."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Complete?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Take a look around you.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Take Mister Sulu to his quarters.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,He is relieved of duty.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Confine them to quarters.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Did you hear me?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Did you hear me?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Yes, we must."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm losing command.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm losing my ability to command.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm losing the Enterprise.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm losing command.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm losing the Enterprise.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,The ship is sailing on and on.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm alone.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Alone.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Alone.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm losing command.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I've lost command.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I've lost the Enterprise.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I've got command.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I've got command.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I've got command.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Auxiliary control, my Vulcan friend."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,This ship is off course.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Scotty.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I want you to override the bridge navigation system and plot a course for Starbase Four.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Why not?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Scotty, listen to me."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,The Enterprise has been invaded by alien beings.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Its destination is Marcos.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"If we take it there, millions will die the way they died at Triacus."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"No, I'm all right, Spock."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,My beast is finished.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,It won't return.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Spock, they're not the alien beings."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,They're children being misled.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,They're children.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,They don't understand the evil that they're doing.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,We'll have to kill them.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"What is it, Ensign?"
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,By whose order?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Where did you hear this order, Ensign?"
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Now, listen to me."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,This order is false.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I want you and your men to return to their stations.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Ensign, listen to me."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Ensign, listen to me."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"This is a false order, Ensign."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I know that, Ensign."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"You have never disobeyed an order, but an alien being is aboard this ship."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Ensign, listen to me."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,You will disobey this order!
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Enough.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Take these men to detention then join me on the bridge.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,The Enterprise will never reach Marcos Twelve.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,We will not be landing there.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,The crew does not understand.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"When we make them understand as I understand, they won't take you to Marcos."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Your friend?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Where is your friend?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Where is that stowaway?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Why does he hide?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Good.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm glad you're not afraid of me.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,(Takes his seat) But your leader is afraid.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,What's he afraid of?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,He's afraid to be seen.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"And when the crew sees and hears him, they'll understand that he is not their friend, and they won't follow him."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Then let him show himself.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Bring him out!
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Let him prove to me that he is my friend and I'll follow him to Marcos Twelve and to the ends of the universe!
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Mister Spock, playback the chant the children sang to summon up the Gorgan."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,The time has come to see the world as it is.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Come on.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I did, Gorgan."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,My beast is gone.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,It lost its power in the light of reality.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I command again, and I ordered you here."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,And we know you.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Not if we join together to fight you.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,We're also very strong.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Children, I have pictures of some of you on Triacus."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,I'd like to show them to you.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Would you like to see them?
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Mister Spock, the pictures."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,So we were told.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Mister Spock, the pictures."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,The children are waiting.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Not always, Gorgan."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Not this time.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,You can't hide from them.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,They see you as we see you.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,They know what you are.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Even the children learn.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Don't be afraid.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Look at him.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Without you children, he's nothing."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,The evil remains within him.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Look how ugly he really is.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,Look at him and don't be afraid.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,It's all right.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"It's all right, Mary."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,It's all right.
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"It's all right, isn't it, Doctor?"
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Reverse course, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Set course for Starbase Four, Mister Sulu."
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,"He's dead, Captain."
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,Cyalodin.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,"No, Jim."
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,No indication of any kind.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,They seem completely secure and unafraid.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,"I don't insist, Jim, but I can't dismiss the possibility."
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,"What those children saw is incredible, Jim."
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,"The way those deaths occurred, any reaction is possible including lacunar amnesia."
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,That's my diagnosis.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Until specific tests can be made, it remains that."
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,Not until the fabric of the traumatisation weakens or you come up with another explanation for their behaviour.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,Forcing them to see this experience now could cause permanent damage.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,Come on.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,It's time to be going.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,The tests show no evidence of tensions due to lying.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,They behave as though nothing had gone wrong.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,They check out sound physically.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,There are no signs of any foreign biochemical substances to account for their present state.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,"I have no answers, Jim."
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Well, can't it wait till we get to a Starbase hospital so they can be checked out by child specialists?"
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Well, I won't prevent you questioning them, but it could harm the children if you do."
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,Be careful.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,Or by misleading the innocent.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,Do you mean the children may be involved?
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,"I think I read you, Jim, but as medical officer I must warn you that unless the normal grief is tapped and released from these children, you are treading dangerously."
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,"They're crying, Jim."
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,"I don't know how it happened, but it's good to see."
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,Yes.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,It's all right.
MCCOY,And The Children Shall Lead,We can help them now.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,Must destroy ourselves!
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,Alien upon us.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,The enemy from within.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,The enemy!
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,Log date 5025.3.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,"Ever since our arrival on Triacus, I've felt a certain growing feeling of uneasiness."
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,At first I attributed it to the usual case of nerves associated with any new project.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,"However, I've found that the rest of my associates are also bothered by these anxieties."
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,"The only ones not affected are the children Bless them, they find the whole thing an exciting adventure."
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,"Ah, to be young again."
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,(tense) 5032.4.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,The feeling of anxiety we've all been experiencing is growing worse.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,5038.3.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,Professor Wilkins finished his excavation today.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,"Although whatever civilisation that might have been here was destroyed by some natural catastrophe, it would appear that one of the race took refuge in the cave."
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,"(Tommy enters the Bridge) And, for our efforts, we are becoming only more apprehensive."
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,(Tommy clenches his fist) As if some unseen force were influencing us.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm being influenced to do things that do not make sense.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,I even went so far as to call Starfleet Command to request a spaceship to be used as a transport.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,It was only when I couldn't tell them what I wanted to transport that I began to realise that my mind was being directed.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,"I decided to send a dispatch to Starfleet, warning them."
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,God forgive us.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,Must destroy ourselves!
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,Alien upon us.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,The enemy from within.
STARNES,And The Children Shall Lead,The enemy!
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,You missed me.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,Come on.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,Play with us.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,Come on.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,(They make a circle and dance around Kirk.)
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Ring around the rosy, pocket full of posy."
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Ashes, ashes, we all fall down!"
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Ring around the rosy, pocket full of posy."
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Ashes, ashes, we all fall down!"
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,Let's go and play.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,But we're just beginning to have fun.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,That was fun.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,Please do.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,You weren't there very long.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,You don't know.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,Ha.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,That's what you think.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,Watch out.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,Watch out.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,I'll sting you.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,Yeah.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Aw, do we have to?"
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,He sees Triacus on the screen.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,Will we reach Marcos Twelve soon?
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,They will!
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,They will!
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,He will come if we call him.
MARY,And The Children Shall Lead,He's not afraid of anybody.
STEVE,And The Children Shall Lead,I did not.
STEVE,And The Children Shall Lead,(he gets his ice cream) It's coconut and vanilla.
STEVE,And The Children Shall Lead,They're both white.
STEVE,And The Children Shall Lead,Chocolate wobble and pistachio.
STEVE,And The Children Shall Lead,And peach.
STEVE,And The Children Shall Lead,Yeah?
STEVE,And The Children Shall Lead,Yeah.
STEVE,And The Children Shall Lead,Mine sure did.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,Hi.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,Who are you?
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,I'm Tommy Starnes.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,"This is Mary, Steve, Ray, and Don."
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Yes, they did."
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Busy, busy."
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Can we have some more ice cream, please?"
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,See what I told you?
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,They all say it.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,Saw where?
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,You were there.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,I saw him.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Yeah, he was very upset."
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,I didn't ask him.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,How should I know?
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,"He was always upset, just like you, Captain Kirk."
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,You have your reasons.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,That place?
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,That's for adults.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,My parents?
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,They love it down there.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,Always busy.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,(he nearly chokes up) They're happy.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,Can I go now?
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,"I'm tired too, you know."
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,I know the way.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Captain, after we leave here, can you take us to Marcos Twelve?"
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,But I have relatives on Marcos Twelve.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Captain, can I stay here and watch?"
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,I'll be very quiet.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,Hi.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,What is that?
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,Will we see that all the time we stay here?
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,He thinks he sees it.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,Very soon.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,Go to your stations.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,"Mary, you remain here with me."
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,The crew will take us.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,The crew believes.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,We are going to Marcos!
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,We are going to follow our friend!
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,But we won't.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,We don't need him.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,We're not afraid of you.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,He's not afraid of anything.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,He is our friend.
TOMMY,And The Children Shall Lead,No!
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,Humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they choose and excluding that which is painful.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,The attack on Professor Starnes' party must surely have been unprovoked.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I stand corrected, Captain."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,Induced would be a more precise term.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,Induced by an outside force.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,The release of bacteria.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,Or a helpless mental depression and a state of suicidal anxiety could have been chemically induced.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I do not know, but it is possible."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"A valid assumption, I would say."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"At present, yes."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,(his tricorder beeps) Odd.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,There seems to be some disturbance coming from that cave.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Definitely not humanoid, Captain."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,Impossible to make any specific identification.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,The readings do not correlate with any known information.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I'm not aware of it, Captain."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I am not familiar with anxiety, but I wasn't aware it could be registered on sensors."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Are you all right, Captain?"
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"(enters) Captain, I have extracted the salient portion of Professor Starnes' tapes."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Among the technical facts he gathered, Professor Starnes also offered some rather unscientific hypotheses."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"There is another portion, Captain, which I believe you'll find particularly interesting."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,Unknown.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"He never completed the entry, and the dispatch was never sent."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Except for scenes of family life, games and picnics with the children, that is the complete record."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,Whatever overwhelmed them must have done so with incredible speed.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Otherwise, the professor would have provided details of the experience."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,He was an excellent scientist and tireless in his pursuit of the truth.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Possible, Captain."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,Evil does seek to maintain power by suppressing the truth.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"According to the legend, Triacus was the seat of a band of marauders who made constant war throughout the system of Epsilon Indi."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"After many centuries, the destroyers were themselves destroyed by those they had preyed upon."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"No, like so many legends, this one too has a frightening ending."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,It warns that the evil is awaiting a catalyst to set it again into motion and send it marauding across the galaxy.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I was speaking of a legend, Captain."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"According to Federation records, this is the first."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"He said an unseen force was influencing him, that he recognised it, was beginning to fight it and cancelled his request for a ship."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,I am unable to lock on to the proper co-ordinates.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,It appears we are no longer orbiting Triacus.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Captain, we are no longer orbiting Triacus."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Captain, why are we bothering Starfleet?"
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,This bridge is under complete control.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,There is no need.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"I cannot obey your order, Captain."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Captain, we must get off this bridge."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,Captain.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,Jim.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Correct, Captain."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Where to, Captain?"
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Captain, so long as the children are present, there is danger."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,They are the carriers.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,They are followers.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Without followers, evil cannot spread."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Captain, the four hundred and thirty men and women on board the Enterprise and the ship itself are endangered by these children."
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Perhaps that is true, but the evil that is within them is spreading fast, and unless we can find a way to remove it"
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,You take from those who do not know you.
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,Why should you fear it?
SPOCK,And The Children Shall Lead,"Tommy's father would have destroyed you, but he recognised you too late."
DON,And The Children Shall Lead,"I'm, I'm sorry, Captain Kirk."
DON,And The Children Shall Lead,"Oh, not yet."
DON,And The Children Shall Lead,That dirty old planet?
DON,And The Children Shall Lead,Parents like stupid things.
DON,And The Children Shall Lead,Guess what we are.
RAY,And The Children Shall Lead,Not now.
RAY,And The Children Shall Lead,What's so good about that place?
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,"All right, children."
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,Each card is a different flavour.
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,"You take your pick, and the computer will mix your favourite combination."
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,"Now, what would you like?"
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,Call out your favourites.
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,"Well, would you like a surprise, Stevie?"
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,"There, there now, Stevie."
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,There are unpleasant surprises as well as pleasant ones.
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,That was your unpleasant surprise.
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,"Now, what would you like for your pleasant surprise?"
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,"Well, coming right up."
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,All right.
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,It's going to be a wonderful surprise.
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,"After this, we can all play games."
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,How do you like getting ice cream out of a computer?
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,"Oh, of course."
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,"Oh, I don't know about that."
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,Parents like children.
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,I know.
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,A swarm of bees.
CHAPEL,And The Children Shall Lead,"Very good idea, Captain."
ALL,And The Children Shall Lead,Vanilla!
ALL,And The Children Shall Lead,Chocolate!
ALL,And The Children Shall Lead,Cherry!

KIDS,And The Children Shall Lead,Yeah.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"(echoy voice) You have done very well, my friends."
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,You have done what must be done.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,You have come aboard the Enterprise.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,Now our destination is a Federation settlement.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,Captain Kirk will undoubtedly choose a closer station.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,Do not let that deter you.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,Marcos Twelve has millions of people on it.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,Nearly a million will join us as our friends.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,The rest will be our enemies.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"Together with our other friends who will join us, we will defeat our enemies as we defeated them on Triacus."
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,A million friends on Marcos will make us invincible.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"No one will tell us where to go, when to sleep, where to eat."
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"The universe will be mine to command, yours to play in."
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"To accomplish this great mission, we must first control the Enterprise."
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"To control the ship, we first must control the crew."
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,You know how to do that.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,That is your next task.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"And as you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do."
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"As you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do."
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"As you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do."
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,Friends we have reached a moment of crisis.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"The enemy have discovered our operation, but they are too late."
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,They no longer control the ship.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,We do.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,We shall prevail.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,They will take us any place we desire.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,Go back to your stations.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,Maintain your controls.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"If resistance mounts, call upon their beast."
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,Their beast will serve us well.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,The fear in each one of them is the beast which will consume him.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,Remember how it was on Triacus.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"If they resist, so shall it be on the Enterprise."
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"If you need me, call and I will appear."
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,Our new goal is Marcos Twelve.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,It is our new beginning.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,We must not falter.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,Foolish.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,You will be destroyed.
GORGON,And The Children Shall Lead,"I would ask you to join me, but you are gentle, and that is a grave weakness."
SULU,And The Children Shall Lead,"Maintaining standard orbit, Captain."
SULU,And The Children Shall Lead,Hi there.
SULU,And The Children Shall Lead,(blissfully unaware of reality) The planet Triacus.
SULU,And The Children Shall Lead,"With all respects, Captain, you're wrong."
SULU,And The Children Shall Lead,I have Triacus on my screen now.
SULU,And The Children Shall Lead,"Yes, sir."
SULU,And The Children Shall Lead,"Captain, stay away from the controls!"

UHURA,And The Children Shall Lead,A long death.
UHURA,And The Children Shall Lead,Disease and pain.
UHURA,And The Children Shall Lead,I see my death.
UHURA,And The Children Shall Lead,"Oh, God."
UHURA,And The Children Shall Lead,"Captain, don't let it be."
CHEKOV,And The Children Shall Lead,"Yes, we will."
CHEKOV,And The Children Shall Lead,All the time we're here.
CHEKOV,And The Children Shall Lead,I have been instructed to place you and Mister Spock under arrest.
CHEKOV,And The Children Shall Lead,"Starfleet Command, sir."
CHEKOV,And The Children Shall Lead,"I'm sorry, but I must insist you and Mister Spock come with me to the detention section."
CHEKOV,And The Children Shall Lead,"(drawing his phaser) Do not force me to kill you, sir."
CHEKOV,And The Children Shall Lead,I will if I have to.
CHEKOV,And The Children Shall Lead,"Will you come peacefully, Captain?"
CHEKOV,And The Children Shall Lead,"I have never disobeyed an order, Captain."
CHEKOV,And The Children Shall Lead,You know I have never
CHEKOV,And The Children Shall Lead,I will not disobey now!
CHEKOV,And The Children Shall Lead,I cannot disobey!
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,When did we change course?
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,"What do you mean, we haven't changed course?"
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,Look at your bridge control monitor.
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,Have you gone completely blind?
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,That's not orbiting position.
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,What the devil do you think you're doing?
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,You blind fool!
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,Can't you see in front of you?
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,We're not in orbit.
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,You are disobeying an order from the bridge.
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,Now step aside.
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,Not yet.
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,"I can't do that, sir."
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,These are very sensitive instruments.
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,I will not have you upset their delicate balance.
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,"We would all be lost, forever lost."
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,(Spock sees Don) Go away now.
SCOTT,And The Children Shall Lead,Go away or we'll kill you.
MAN,And The Children Shall Lead,We haven't changed course.
MAN,And The Children Shall Lead,"We're still in orbit, sir."
MAN,And The Children Shall Lead,"Don't touch the controls, sir."
MAN,And The Children Shall Lead,We must remain in this orbit till the bridge orders a change.
MAN,And The Children Shall Lead,I will not disobey an order from the bridge.
MAN,And The Children Shall Lead,You're losing control of yourself.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,Who has summoned me?
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,"No, Captain."
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,I command here.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,My followers are strong and faithful and obedient.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,That's why we take what is ours wherever we go.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,"Then you know I must win, Captain."
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,"Ah, but your strength is cancelled by your gentleness."
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,You are full of goodness.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,Such as you cannot be changed.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,You are like the parents.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,You must be eliminated.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,I forbid it.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,I fear nothing.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,They would not help transport us.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,They were against us.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,They had to be eliminated.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,You are also too late.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,The kind ones always are.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,You are my future generals.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,Together we can raise armies of followers.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,Go to your posts!
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,The first great victories are upon us.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,You will see.
GORGAN,And The Children Shall Lead,We have millions of friends on Marcos Twelve.

SULU,Spock's Brain,"Phaser banks standing by, sir."
SULU,Spock's Brain,What happened?
SULU,Spock's Brain,"No change from last reading, sir."
SULU,Spock's Brain,I've got it again.
SULU,Spock's Brain,An ion trail matching when we first saw her.
SULU,Spock's Brain,Warp six.
SULU,Spock's Brain,"No mistake, sir."
SULU,Spock's Brain,"Captain, I've lost the trail."
SULU,Spock's Brain,"It's gone, sir."
SULU,Spock's Brain,A sudden deaction shift.
SULU,Spock's Brain,"But that ship, Captain, either it was many years ahead of us or the most incredible design fluke in history."
SULU,Spock's Brain,But a technological rating of only three.
SULU,Spock's Brain,They couldn't possibly have put that ship we saw into space.
SULU,Spock's Brain,"I say planet four, Captain."
SULU,Spock's Brain,At least planet four is ahead of three technologically.
SULU,Spock's Brain,"A hunch, Captain?"
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,Range forty three thousand and closing.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,Thirty eight thousand and closing.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,System Sigma Draconis.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Nothing, sir."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Aye, Captain."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Sun, spectral type, Gamma nine."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Nine planets, three of them, Class M possessing sapient life according to reports and long-range scanning."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"The one on the left, number three, rates letter B on the industrial scale."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Yes, sir."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Second planet Class M, number four, rates letter G."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,Number six.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,No sign of industrial development.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"At last report, in a Glacial Age."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Sapient life plentiful, but on a most primitive level."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Yes, sir."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"No, sir."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Yes, sir."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Yes, sir."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,No sign of organised civilisation.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,Primitive humanoids picked up at irregular intervals.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"I can't explain it, sir."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,Sigma Draconis Three.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"It's closest, heaviest population."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,None of these planets could.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,Several thousand years at least.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,Only the tropical zone is ice-free.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"What if you guess wrong, Captain?"
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"No structures, Captain."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,No mechanised objects that I can read.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,No surface consumption or generation of energy.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Atmosphere is perfectly all right, of course."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Temperature, a high maximum of forty."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,Livable.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Captain, five hundred metres in that direction there's a foundation under the surface."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,A huge one.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,Registrations all over the place.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Yes, sir."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Immensely old, completely buried."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,But they were here once.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,What could the Others do to cause such terror?
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,A peculiar mixture.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,And the male humanoid who doesn't know the meaning of the word female.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"If it will trap the creatures for the Others, Captain, won't it trap us, too?"
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,It might be a long wait.
CHEKOV,Spock's Brain,We may as well be comfortable.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"What do you read, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Any contact, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Keep trying.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Magnification ten, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Well, Scotty?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Interesting design.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Life forms, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Directed at what?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Security guard.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I'm Captain James Kirk.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,This is the Starship Enterprise.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Helm status, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Condition reports from all decks, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Spock.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Where's Spock?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Yes, what is it?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,All right.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,On my way.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Spock.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What happened?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Like this?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What happened?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You've got him on complete life support.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Was he dead?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What do you mean?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Come on, Bones."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What's the mystery?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,His what?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,How could he survive?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"If his brain is missing, then Spock is dying."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,That girl.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,From that ship.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,She took it.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"I don't know why, or where, but she must have taken it."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Bones, how long can you keep him functioning?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"That's not good enough, Doctor."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Then we'll take him with us.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"In search of his brain, Doctor."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"From what you say, the moment we find it we must restore it to his body, or we lose him."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I'll find it.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,It was taken out.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,It can be put back in.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,The thief that took it has the knowledge.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I'll force it out of her.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You and Scotty have Spock ready.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Where does the trail lead to?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Lock on, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Maximum speed.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,No question about the trail?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"All scanners, extreme sweep."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Well?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"We've lost her trail, but she went into that system."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Mister Chekov, put a schematic of Sigma Draconis on the screen."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Read out, Mister Chekov?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,She was breathing our air.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,She must've gone to one of them.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Show us the three Class-M planets.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Mister Chekov.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Earth equivalent approximately 1485.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,The year 2030.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Third Class M planet, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Now.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"as I understand it, Mister Chekov, there are three Class-M planets,"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Not one of which is capable of launching an interstellar flight,"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Yet one of them accomplished it.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Thank you, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,That's the primitive glaciated planet.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,The source of it?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"What do your surface readings show, Mister Chekov?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,With regular pulsations of generated energy?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I can't afford to guess wrong.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"I've got to choose the right planet, get there, find the brain."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Eight hours and thirty five minutes.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Recommendations, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,But advanced ion propulsion is beyond even our capabilities.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,It'd be a miracle if they had developed it.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Yes.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Yes.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Why would they want it?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Eight hours and thirty four minutes.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Planet six is glaciated, you say?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,But the energy.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Regular.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,It's there.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,It's real.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Have the transporter room stand by.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I'm taking a landing party down to planet six.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"A hunch, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"If I guess wrong, Mister Spock is dead."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Spock will die.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Suit temperatures to seventy two.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Life-form readings, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,(gets a look) Mister Scott?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Watch out.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We know their development is primitive.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Read out, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You have a thick skin.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Phasers on stun.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I want them conscious.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Fire only on my signal.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Flank out.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We mean you no harm.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"We're not your enemies, we're your friends."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We only wish to talk to you.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,No.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We come from a far place.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We are men.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Like yourselves.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Who are the Others?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Do they live here with you?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Do they come from the sky?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Do they come for your women as well?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,The female of your kind.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Don't you have a mate?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Will you take us where we can find the Others?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We do.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We want to find them.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Take us there and we'll let you go.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Buildings?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Somewhere down there is where the Others live.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Scotty, see if you can find a way down."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,It's all right.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,It's all right.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Let him go.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"What was it he said, pain and delight?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,A dead and buried city on a planet in a glacial age.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I don't think so.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Scotty.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Metal.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Forged, tempered."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Our apish friends didn't make these.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What do you think?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Or the food could be a lure set by the Others to bring them in here.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,And this cave a trap.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Exactly.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Have Doctor McCoy beam down immediately.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Mister Chekov, you and the security team will remain here at the entrance."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We'll be in constant contact with you.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"All right, Bones."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Bring him along.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Ready?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Phasers on stun.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,A lot of it?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What source?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Or what?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We're slowing down.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Is she all right?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Who's in charge?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I wish to speak to him.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What have you done with Spock's brain?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Where've you taken it?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You're lying!
KIRK,Spock's Brain,(to Scott) See what you can pick up on your communicator.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We don't want to hurt you.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What is this place?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Who are you?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Spock, is that you?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Yes, Spock."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Yes.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"We'll get you, Spock."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,It won't be long.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Quickly!
KIRK,Spock's Brain,There she is.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,That's the one.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What have you done with Spock's brain?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What have you done with Spock's brain?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,This is Spock.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You saw him on the ship.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You have his brain.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,It must be restored to him immediately.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What have you done with it?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"I do not know about Luma, but you were on the Enterprise."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I saw you.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You came to my ship!
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I saw you on my ship.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"No, it doesn't."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Sorry.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We don't want to hurt anyone.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,No.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We'll stay here and learn about you and tell you of us.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I wish to talk to those in charge.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Yes, the organisers, the managers."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,The leader of your people.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Who controls this complex?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Yes, the Controller."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,The Controller.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Who controls?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"I would like to meet, to see him."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We intend no harm.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"No, no, no."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I promise you.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Bones.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Scotty.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Spock's brain controls
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Great leader.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Great leader!
KIRK,Spock's Brain,(He kneels in front of Kara.)
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We come from a far place to learn from your Controller.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,He is our friend.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You must take us to him.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We beg you.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Soon it will be too late.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You must take us.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I never felt anything like that.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Every nerve in my body was on fire.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"No wonder the Morgs are so obedient, and terrified."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,How is this place kept functioning by the primitive minds we've met?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,They were smart enough to invent these training devices.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What a way to maintain control over a man.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Yes, I certainly did notice those delightful aspects."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,But that too was strictly under command of the women.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"With a communicator, we might be able to find out."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,This fellow is keeping us from our property.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,I certainly think that science might provide an answer.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Agreed, Doctor."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Science will triumph.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Come on, Scotty."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Bones, give them something to keep them out for a while."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,(into communicator) Spock.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Spock.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Come on, Spock."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Spock, you were on this frequency, Spock."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,No.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"We might be able to locate you, if you gave us some idea of what they were using you for."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Is it medical?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Spock, we don't have time for that."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We came to put you back.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Where are you?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Back into your body.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We brought it along with us.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,The skill to remove it exists right where we are.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Restoring it must also be possible.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,That's why we've got to get to you as quickly as we can.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Eighteen hours and twelve minutes.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"That leaves us exactly five hours and forty eight minutes, Spock."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Yes.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Very brief.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,That's why we must get to you immediately.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Beam us a signal so we can home in on you.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Bones.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,(Spock's body stands up and they walk out of the room)
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Oh, Spock, one question."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We've got pain-giving devices attached to us.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Can you tell us how to get them off.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Oh, yes it does, Spock."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"(further along) Keep concentrating, Spock."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Keep concentrating, Spock."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You'll find another Controller.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Spock, you're in a black box tied in with light rays into a complex control panel."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"You say you're breathing, pumping blood, maintaining temperature?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Is it possible that you're re-circulating air, running heating plants, purifying water?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,He will not stay.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"(He makes Spock release her, and grabs her himself, taking off her bracelet.)"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Now, you took his brain."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You will put it back.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,How did you do it?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,She was on the Enterprise.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,She must have done it.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,How did you do it?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,How do you get the old knowledge?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What is the Teacher?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,How does it work?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Show us.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You must tell us.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,How does it work?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Show us!
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We'll protect you.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We're not the first to bring you the knowledge of killing.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"If you continue, you'll kill Spock."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,But Spock will be dead.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,His body's dying this minute.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,No one may kill a man.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Not for any purpose.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,It cannot be condoned.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You must help us.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"When you came to the ship, you had the knowledge."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Yet, when we came here, you didn't."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,How long does the knowledge last?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"If you had the knowledge, could you restore what you've taken?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You must help us.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You must restore with that knowledge what you have taken.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You must put back what you have taken.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Go ahead, Doctor."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Put the Teacher on.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,No.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You won't be destroyed.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"You'll be without your Controller for the first time, but you'll be much better off, I think."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"No, you'll live and develop as you should have."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,All this shouldn't have been done for you.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Now the women here below and the men here above will control together.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,There are other ways.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You'll discover them.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"You must move to the surface, you understand."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"No, you won't."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"You'll learn to build houses, to keep warm, to work."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,We'll help you for a while.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Humans have survived under worse conditions.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,It's a matter of evolution.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You'll be fine.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What is it?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Bones?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Bones?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Bones, you can't stop now."
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Bones?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,You could.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,A while ago it was child's play.
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Well?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,Well?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"How do you feel, Spock?"
KIRK,Spock's Brain,What's that?
KIRK,Spock's Brain,"Well, we took the risk, Doctor."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Configuration unidentified.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Ion propulsion, high velocity, though of a unique technology."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,One.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Humanoid or similar.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Low level of activity.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Life-support systems functioning.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Interior atmosphere, conventional nitrogen-oxygen."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Instruments indicate a transferal beam emanating from the area of the humanoid life form.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Directed at the Bridge of the Enterprise, Captain."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Activity without end, but with no volition."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Captain?
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Captain Kirk?
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Captain, there is a definite pleasurable experience connected with the hearing of your voice."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Is that you, Doctor McCoy, and are you with the Captain?"
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Engineer Scott as well.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Unfortunately, I do not know where I am."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"A practical idea, Captain."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,It seems unlikely that I shall be able to get to you.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Yes, Captain, I am still here."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Have you returned to the Enterprise?
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,I am not certain.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,I seem to have a body which stretches into infinity.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Then what am l?
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"It could explain much, Doctor."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"My medulla oblongata is hard at work apparently breathing, apparently pumping blood, apparently maintaining a normal physiologic temperature."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Why are you endangering your lives by coming here?
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Back where?
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Thoughtful, Captain, but probably impractical."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"While I might trust the doctor to remove a splinter or lance a boil, I do not believe he has the knowledge to restore a brain."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"No denigration intended, Doctor McCoy."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,That skill does not yet exist in the galaxy.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Captain, I appreciate the risks you are taking on my behalf, but I must insist they are worthwhile only if there is a reasonable chance for success."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Let me ask you, how much time has elapsed since"
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Doctor McCoy must've told you that twenty four hours is the maximum my body can
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"It does seem all too brief a time to develop such skills, does it not?"
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Acknowledged.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,I shall give it top priority.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Captain, I have an answer for you."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,It seems your pain bands are manually controlled.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,The red button on a bracelet releases them.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,I know that does not make much sense.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,How very flattering.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Indeed, Captain."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,That is unquestionably part of what I am doing.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"If I may explain, Captain."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,She refers to the tape storehouse of knowledge of the builders of this place.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,I scan it.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,A most impressive store.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,It is a device with feeding circuits.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,They lead into the mind of the priestess leader.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Its use is strictly predetermined by the builders.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,She is an alien.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,The configurations of her brain are different.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"It could cause irreparable damage to your human brain, Doctor."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Captain, you might lose the doctor that way."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,I cannot allow you to jeopardise your life for me.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,(hoarse) Yes.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Doctor McCoy.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"If you will finish reconnecting my speech centre, I might be able to help."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Yes.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,That's correct.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,One thing at a time.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Ah, ah, mmm."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,(normal voice) That's better.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Now, Doctor."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Try the sonic separator.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Yes, I believe I already have some sensation of feeling."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Please stimulate the nerve endings and observe the physical reactions, one by one."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"In each case, I shall tell you when the probe is correct."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,You will then seal using the tri-laser connector.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Ready.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,(twitching) Correct.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Correct.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Correct.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Very good, Doctor."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"Congratulations, Doctor."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,And thank you.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"On the whole, Captain, I believe I am quite fit."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,A remarkable example of a retrograde civilisation.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"At the peak, advanced beyond any of our capabilities and now operating at this primitive level which you saw."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,And it all began thousands of years ago when a glacial age reoccurred.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,This underground complex was developed for the women.
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"The men remained above, and a male-female schism took place."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,A fascinating cultural development of a kind which never
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"(to Kara, amid laughter) As I was saying, a fascinating cultural development of the kind which hasn't been seen in ages."
SPOCK,Spock's Brain,"The last such occurrence took place on old Earth, when the Romans were warring with the ...."
UHURA,Spock's Brain,"Hailing on all frequencies, sir."
UHURA,Spock's Brain,All languages have been attempted.
UHURA,Spock's Brain,No response.
UHURA,Spock's Brain,Now using standard interstellar symbols.
UHURA,Spock's Brain,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,Spock's Brain,Security guard to the Bridge.
UHURA,Spock's Brain,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,Spock's Brain,Deck five.
UHURA,Spock's Brain,"Personnel, no damage."
UHURA,Spock's Brain,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,Spock's Brain,"No signal at all, Captain."
UHURA,Spock's Brain,"Captain, I'm picking up high energy generation on planet six."
UHURA,Spock's Brain,It could be natural.
UHURA,Spock's Brain,"Volcanic activity, steam, any number of causes."
UHURA,Spock's Brain,But it's very regular.
UHURA,Spock's Brain,What would they want with his brain?
UHURA,Spock's Brain,What would they want with Mister Spock's brain?
UHURA,Spock's Brain,What use is it?
UHURA,Spock's Brain,Why do they want it?
UHURA,Spock's Brain,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,Spock's Brain,"It doesn't make sense, but it's there."
UHURA,Spock's Brain,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,Spock's Brain,Enterprise.
UHURA,Spock's Brain,Uhura here.
UHURA,Spock's Brain,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"It beats me, but isn't she a beauty?"
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,I've never seen anything like her.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,And ion propulsion at that.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,They could teach us a thing or two.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Aye.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Scattered.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Widely spaced.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"Humanoid, all right."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,On the large side.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Aye.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Captain!
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"There's someone, something out there in the rocks."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Five of them.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"Humanoid, large."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,A companion.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Captain!
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"Over here, sir."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,There's food in there and a whole pile of other stuff.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,A storehouse for our muscular friends.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,It could be a warning device to keep those creatures away from the food.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"In that case, the beam would be a signal."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Keep him close to the right.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"Captain, that power we picked up above, we're getting closer."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Enough to push this planet out of orbit.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Either a nuclear pile a hundred miles across or
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Ion power.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Aye.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"Captain, I've got something, but I can't quite get a fix on it."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"Mister Spock, where are you?"
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Aye.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"There's no sun, but there's light."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,That's impossible.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Who built the machines?
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,These are on to stay for a while.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Must be a magnetic lock of some kind.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Those women could never have set up anything as complex as this has to be.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"Why, that takes engineering genius."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,But there's no sign of engineering genius in any of those women.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"Pain and delight, he said up above."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,How does Spock's brain fit into this?
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Isn't there a way to correct that situation?
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Body?
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"Why, you have none."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Got it.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,"Must be in there, Captain."
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,That phaser is set to kill.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,I've never seen anything like it.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,He's operating at warp speed.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,I'd like a try at that teacher myself.
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,Captain Kirk!
SCOTT,Spock's Brain,He's forgetting.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Jim!
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Jim!
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,You'd better come down to Sickbay
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Right now.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Now.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Thank God.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"No, not like this."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I don't know.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,He was worse than dead.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Jim.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,His brain is gone.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,It's been removed surgically.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,It's the greatest technical job I've ever seen.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Every nerve ending in the brain must've been neatly sealed.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"Nothing ripped, nothing torn, no bleeding."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,It's a medical miracle.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,No.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,That incredible Vulcan physique hung on until the life-support cycle took over.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,His body lives.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,The autonomic functions continue.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,But there is no mind.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,What girl?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I can't give you any guarantee.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"If it happened to any of us, I'd say indefinitely."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,But Vulcan physiology limits what I can do.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Spock's body is more dependent on that tremendous brain for life support.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Take him?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Take him where?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"Jim, where are you going to look?"
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"In this whole galaxy, where are you going to look for Spock's brain?"
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,How are you going to find it?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"Even if you do, I can't restore it."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I don't have the medical technique.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,But I don't know how.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"If you don't find it in twenty four hours, you'd better forget the whole thing, Jim."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Call Chekov and tell him to send my stomach down.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I'll have her talking in a minute.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"She's not, Jim."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,No change in reading.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,She doesn't know.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"Jim, it's no use."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,You'll get nothing out of that one.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Hers is the mind of a child.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"Where are you, Spock?"
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Where else would I be?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"Jim, she may not remember or even really know."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Disassociation could be complete.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,It doesn't seem possible she could have performed surgery on Spock.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"Yes, for instance, above it's cold and harsh."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"And below, it's warm."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,The air is fresh.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Who are the doctors?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Who operates?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,We just want to talk to somebody about Spock's brain.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,That's all.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Yes.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"Yes, in a way it is."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,The human brain controls the individual's functions.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,It's not possible.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I wouldn't believe the human organism could take such pain.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I'm sure you noticed the delight aspect of this place.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"It does, Captain."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,You are a disembodied brain.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Thank you.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I told him.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Jim.. Spock.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,No pain.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"She couldn't, Jim."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Her mind is functioning on a very simple level.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Mental faculties here seem to be almost atrophied because of non-use.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Without you there could be no delicate miracle that kept Spock's brain alive.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Yes.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"From the very first, I appreciated your ability."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,It would be just enough time.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"Jim, it worked for her."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,It might work for me.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I'm a surgeon already.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"If I could learn these techniques, I might be able to retain them."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"He might, but we're sure to lose you if I don't try."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"Spock, didn't you hear?"
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I might be able to retain and bring these techniques to the world.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"Jim, isn't it worth that risk?"
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Wouldn't you insist upon taking such a risk yourself?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Of course.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Of course.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,A child could do it.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,A child could do it.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I can't.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"All the ganglia, the nerves."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,There are a million of them.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,What am I supposed to do?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,What am I supposed to do?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I'm trying to thread a needle with a sledgehammer.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,What am I supposed to do?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I can't remember.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I don't remember.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,No one can restore a brain.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"He's dying, and I can't stop it."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Spock?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Speech centre.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Sonic separator.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Tri-laser connector.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Ready?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Right forefinger.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Right wrist.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Right elbow.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I'll never live this down.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,This Vulcan is telling me how to operate.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,Closed.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,How do I know?
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I could have made a thousand mistakes.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"Sealing nerve endings, joining ganglia."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,"The fluid balance is correct, but I don't know."
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I knew it was wrong.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I shouldn't have done it.
MCCOY,Spock's Brain,I should have never reconnected his mouth.
CHAPEL,Spock's Brain,Functioning.
CHAPEL,Spock's Brain,I found him on the table.
MORG,Spock's Brain,You are not the Others?
MORG,Spock's Brain,Men?
MORG,Spock's Brain,"You are small, like the Others."
MORG,Spock's Brain,Givers of pain and delight.
MORG,Spock's Brain,No.
MORG,Spock's Brain,They come.
MORG,Spock's Brain,They give pain and delight.
MORG,Spock's Brain,They are here.
MORG,Spock's Brain,You will see.
MORG,Spock's Brain,The Others will come for you.
MORG,Spock's Brain,They come for all like us.
MORG,Spock's Brain,Women?
MORG,Spock's Brain,Your words say nothing.
MORG,Spock's Brain,Mate?
MORG,Spock's Brain,(afraid) No one wants to find them.
MORG,Spock's Brain,No!
MORG,Spock's Brain,No!
MORG,Spock's Brain,"No, do not go there!"
MORG,Spock's Brain,No!
MORG,Spock's Brain,No!
LUMA,Spock's Brain,You do not belong here.
LUMA,Spock's Brain,You are not Morg.
LUMA,Spock's Brain,Him?
LUMA,Spock's Brain,What is him?
LUMA,Spock's Brain,You are not Morg or Eymorg.
LUMA,Spock's Brain,I know nothing about a brain.
LUMA,Spock's Brain,This place is here.
LUMA,Spock's Brain,I am Luma.
LUMA,Spock's Brain,I am Eymorg.
LUMA,Spock's Brain,You are not Eymorg.
LUMA,Spock's Brain,You are not Morg.
LUMA,Spock's Brain,What are you?
LUMA,Spock's Brain,"Do not take them, Kara."
LUMA,Spock's Brain,Do not take them to the Controller.
KARA,Spock's Brain,What are you?
KARA,Spock's Brain,Why are you here?
KARA,Spock's Brain,You have something to speak?
KARA,Spock's Brain,We do not know Spock.
KARA,Spock's Brain,"Ah, yes, brain."
KARA,Spock's Brain,"You spoke to Luma also of brain, but we do not understand."
KARA,Spock's Brain,I do not know these things you speak of.
KARA,Spock's Brain,We know only here below and here above.
KARA,Spock's Brain,This is our place.
KARA,Spock's Brain,You are not Morg.
KARA,Spock's Brain,You are stranger.
KARA,Spock's Brain,You hurt Luma.
KARA,Spock's Brain,It is not permitted again to hurt anyone.
KARA,Spock's Brain,"If you wish to return to your home, you may go."
KARA,Spock's Brain,In charge?
KARA,Spock's Brain,I am leader.
KARA,Spock's Brain,There is no other.
KARA,Spock's Brain,Control?
KARA,Spock's Brain,Controller?
KARA,Spock's Brain,No.
KARA,Spock's Brain,It is not permitted.
KARA,Spock's Brain,Never!
KARA,Spock's Brain,"Controller is alone, apart."
KARA,Spock's Brain,We serve Controller.
KARA,Spock's Brain,No other is permitted near.
KARA,Spock's Brain,You have come to destroy us.
KARA,Spock's Brain,Brain and brain!
KARA,Spock's Brain,What is brain?
KARA,Spock's Brain,"It is Controller, is it not?"
KARA,Spock's Brain,You lie!
KARA,Spock's Brain,You know me.
KARA,Spock's Brain,You have said that.
KARA,Spock's Brain,You came to take back the Controller.
KARA,Spock's Brain,They will be prevented.
KARA,Spock's Brain,I must learn what to do.
KARA,Spock's Brain,(to Luma) Come with me.
KARA,Spock's Brain,You will keep them here.
KARA,Spock's Brain,No.
KARA,Spock's Brain,Go away.
KARA,Spock's Brain,We will die.
KARA,Spock's Brain,You must not take the Controller away.
KARA,Spock's Brain,We will all die.
KARA,Spock's Brain,The Controller is young and powerful.
KARA,Spock's Brain,Perfect!
KARA,Spock's Brain,You will give life to my people for ten thousand years to come.
KARA,Spock's Brain,The old one is finished!
KARA,Spock's Brain,There is no other than this and will not be another for ten thousand years.
KARA,Spock's Brain,He must stay.
KARA,Spock's Brain,He must stay!
KARA,Spock's Brain,I do not know.
KARA,Spock's Brain,It was the old knowledge.
KARA,Spock's Brain,I put upon my head the Teacher.
KARA,Spock's Brain,The great Teacher of all the ancient knowledge.
KARA,Spock's Brain,I cannot.
KARA,Spock's Brain,Only by command of the ancients may I understand.
KARA,Spock's Brain,No!
KARA,Spock's Brain,The knowledge is forbidden!
KARA,Spock's Brain,I must not know the secret!
KARA,Spock's Brain,I will be punished!
KARA,Spock's Brain,"(confident, assured) Gentlemen, the Controller's explanation of the functioning of the Teacher is essentially correct."
KARA,Spock's Brain,"However, he is giving no credit to me."
KARA,Spock's Brain,I provide the means whereby the knowledge is used.
KARA,Spock's Brain,"Without me, Captain"
KARA,Spock's Brain,"Thank you, Doctor."
KARA,Spock's Brain,That was very gracious.
KARA,Spock's Brain,"Good, Captain Kirk."
KARA,Spock's Brain,"Then you also appreciate that without the Teacher, I would not have the knowledge to use that which you have thoughtfully provided."
KARA,Spock's Brain,So it is.
KARA,Spock's Brain,That is the knowledge you have brought me.
KARA,Spock's Brain,Do not move.
KARA,Spock's Brain,"If your weapon kills, it will kill you."
KARA,Spock's Brain,The Controller die?
KARA,Spock's Brain,"The Controller will live for ten thousand years, and we shall give him all our devotion."
KARA,Spock's Brain,Why do you not understand that the need of my people for their Controller is greater than your need for your friend.
KARA,Spock's Brain,Do not!
KARA,Spock's Brain,I do not know killing.
KARA,Spock's Brain,I do not wish to kill.
KARA,Spock's Brain,The commandment must be fulfilled.
KARA,Spock's Brain,Correct.
KARA,Spock's Brain,Three of your hours.
KARA,Spock's Brain,I would not.
KARA,Spock's Brain,No!
KARA,Spock's Brain,I will not betray my people.
KARA,Spock's Brain,The Controller will stay.
KARA,Spock's Brain,No!
KARA,Spock's Brain,You will have him back and we will be destroyed.
KARA,Spock's Brain,We will die.
KARA,Spock's Brain,They will not help us without the pain.
KARA,Spock's Brain,We will die above in the cold.
GUARD,Spock's Brain,"Yes, mistress."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Mister Marvick.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I am James Kirk, the Captain."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Yes, everything will be taken care of."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"This is Mister Spock, my First Officer."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We mustn't keep the ambassador waiting.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"If you'll go with Mister Scott, I'm sure the two of you will have a great deal in common."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to transporter control centre on the planet."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,This is Captain Kirk.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Inform the ambassador and Doctor Jones we're ready to beam them aboard.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Kirk out.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Are you sure this visor will work?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It's your human half I'm worried about.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Inform me when transport is complete.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to all decks."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,This is Captain Kirk to all ship's personnel.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Clearance plans now in effect.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Clear passageways immediately.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,The Ambassador will be escorted to his quarters at once.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Notify all hands to return to stations.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"All right, let's take her out."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Warp factor two.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I can't understand why they let you go with Kollos.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,The male population of the Federation.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Didn't someone try and talk you out of it?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Well, I'm glad he didn't succeed."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Otherwise, I wouldn't have met you."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Tell me, Doctor Jones."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Why isn't it dangerous for you to be with Kollos?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Spock I can understand.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Nothing makes an impression on him.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"You're very welcome, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"But no human can look at Kollos, even with a visor, without going mad."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,How do you manage?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,To read minds?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I don't understand.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Oh.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Well, I doubt that Mister Spock would don the most revered of all Vulcan symbols merely to annoy you, Doctor Jones."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Yes, very interesting."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I might even say fascinating, but back to your mission."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Doctor, do you feel any way may be found to employ Medusan navigators on starships?"
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It would certainly solve many of our navigational problems.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Yes, I think most of us are attracted by beauty and repelled by ugliness."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,One of the last of our prejudices.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"At the risk of sounding prejudiced, gentlemen, here's to beauty."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"(they stand for the toast) To Miranda Jones, the loveliest human ever to grace a starship."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Some more Antarean brandy?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,(seeing her far-away look) What is it?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,In this room?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Who is it?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Can you tell?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Of course.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Perhaps I'll see
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Sleep well, Miranda."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Yes, she is something special."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Good night, Scotty."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"You dressed up for the occasion, Spock."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Very impressive.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Good evening.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Sleep well.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Bones, what's troubling you with the girl?"
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I didn't think that for a moment.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,What else?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We're all vulnerable in one way or another.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Meaning she's quite a woman.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I agree.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Good night, Bones."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Miranda!
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Miranda?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Miranda!
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Has the Ambassador been hurt?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Who could have done such a thing?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Larry Marvick?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Why?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Captain Kirk to all ship personnel.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Red Alert.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,An attempt was made to murder Ambassador Kollos.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,The murderer is dangerously insane.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,He is Lawrence Marvick.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Be on the watch for him.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Kirk out.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Explain, Lieutenant Sulu."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Get engineering, Uhura."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Can't you disengage power from there, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Put them on intercom.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Security to engineering.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Scotty, where are we?"
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Bones.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,All right.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,All right.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We'll take you to a place to hide.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Where are we?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You mean he just simply died.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Or what he felt.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Damage report, Scotty?"
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Position report, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Then we should be able to navigate back.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Explain.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Hazards?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I could confine her to quarters.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I think that could be arranged.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I may be sentimental, but this is my favourite place."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Earth.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Certainly.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Try these.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Let me see.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It's just a thorn.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I was hoping to make you forget about this today.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You mustn't blame yourself because Marvick loved you.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"But someday, you will want human love and companionship."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Are you willing to spend the rest of your life with the Medusans in order to avoid human emotion?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"A meeting of minds is all very well, but what about love, Miranda?"
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"You're young, attractive and human."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Sooner or later, no matter how beautiful their minds are, you're going to yearn for someone who looks like yourself, someone who isn't ugly."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Miranda, I meant no insult."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Please.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Here we are among the roses.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,A very romantic setting.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I wish there were moonlight, too."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Moonlight would suit you very well.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Miranda, don't."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,What?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Yes, of course."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It's the only reasonable explanation.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You can't see and Kollos can't hurt you.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I think I understand.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You said it.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Pity is the worst of all.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"No, that won't be necessary."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Mister Spock will make the mind-link.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No other decision is possible.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"If we can't persuade you, there is someone who can."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You'll have to take this up with Kollos.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,For your own sake.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Bones, why hadn't you told me?"
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Yes, there's a great deal to respect about that lady."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Am I addressing the Ambassador?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"We don't hold you to blame for what happened, and thank you now for your help."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Yes.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Mister Sulu, release the helm to Mister Spock."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Then go ahead, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Take over, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Thank you, Ambassador."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Mister Chekov, plot a new course."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Ambassador, you must dissolve the link."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,There must be no delay.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Spock!
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Don't look!
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Cover your eyes!
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Don't move!
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No one is to move.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Spock?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Are you all right?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,(pacing) Vulcan mind techniques.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,They seem so untrustworthy now that Spock's life is at stake.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,But does she want to?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,She's been in there so long.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,She tried to help Marvick.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Marvick is dead.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,And Spock is her rival.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Is that any better?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Even Spock felt the violence of her jealousy.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Whatever happens, Bones, don't interfere."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Captain Kirk.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No change?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,What are you doing about it?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Which doesn't seem to be much.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"It's worth a try, isn't it?"
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"After all, he's not a machine."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Only half.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,The other half is human.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Far more human than you, apparently."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"If you don't reach him soon, he'll die."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"But that's what you want, isn't it?"
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Oh yes?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You want him to die.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,What did you do to him on the Bridge?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Did you make him forget to put the visor over his eyes?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Yes, you know your rival, don't you?"
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"You couldn't keep him from making a mind-link with Kollos, something you couldn't do yourself!"
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"With my words, I'll make you hear such ugliness as Spock saw when he looked at Kollos with his naked eyes!"
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,The ugliness is within you!
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Your desire to see Kollos is madness!
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You can never see him.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Never.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"But Spock saw Kollos, and for that he must die."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"The smell of hatred, the stench of jealousy permeates you."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Why don't you strangle him while he lies there?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Kollos knows what's in your heart.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"You can lie to yourself, but you can't lie to Kollos."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Maybe too much.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"You may be right, Bones."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Maybe I shouldn't have gone in.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"She was blind, really blind."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Really in the dark.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,And if he dies.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"If he dies, how do I know that I didn't kill him?"
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,How do I know that she can stand to hear the truth?
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Spock.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Miranda.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I didn't think you'd even talk to me.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Miranda, good luck, Health."
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I have something for you.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I never met a rose that didn't.
KIRK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Peace.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Captain, what are you doing here?"
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You'll have to leave before the Medusan ambassador arrives.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Mister Spock, do you have the visor?"
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You must be sure to wear it.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Humans who get even a glimpse of Medusans have gone insane.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"And the reverse, of course, that what is beautiful is automatically expected to be good."
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Very special.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I suggest you treat her accordingly.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I've known Doctor Jones long enough to be aware of her remarkable gifts.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Well, it's been a long day for me."
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Some other time.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Miranda?
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Larry.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I've got to talk to you.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Please, Miranda, it's important."
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I thought the dinner was never going to end.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Yes, I know you did."
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I didn't.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You were so far away.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Please don't talk of that.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,There's so little time.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Please, Miranda, don't go with Kollos."
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Don't I know it.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I've asked you in restaurants, in the laboratory, on one knee, on both knees."
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Miranda, how can you do this?"
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I understand that you're a woman and that I'm a man, one of your own kind, and that Kollos will never be able to give you anything like this."
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,(he kisses her but she doesn't respond) Why did I ever meet you?
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Miranda.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,So now you want to help me.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Now I know what a mere human male has to do to get a reaction out of you.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Make you think he's a patient.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,The great psychologist.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Why don't you try being a woman for a change?
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Where's Mister Scott?
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We mustn't sleep!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,They come in your dreams!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,That's the worst!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,They suffocate in your dreams!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We're making it out of here!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We'll be safe at the boundaries of the universe!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We'll be safe!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Beyond the boundaries of the galaxy.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We made it.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We're safe.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"We're safe, Captain Kirk."
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Oh, no."
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"No, Captain."
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We mustn't sleep.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"No, they come in your dreams."
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,That's the worst.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,They suffocate in your dreams.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I didn't lose you.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Oh, my beautiful love, I thought I'd lost you."
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Liar!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Liar!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Deceiver!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You're not alone!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You brought it with you.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It's here.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It's here.
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You brought it with you!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Liar!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Liar!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Liar!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,(he tries to strangle Miranda) Don't love her!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Don't love her!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,She'll kill you if you love her!
MARVICK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I love you, Miranda."
SCOTT,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Montgomery Scott, Chief Engineer."
SCOTT,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Call me Scotty.
SCOTT,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Aye, indeed."
SCOTT,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It's a rare privilege meeting one of the designers of the Enterprise.
SCOTT,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Larry, would you like to stop off at Engineering with me?"
SCOTT,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I have a few things to check and a bottle of scotch says you can't handle the controls you designed.
SCOTT,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Good night, gentlemen."
SCOTT,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Ah, there, Marvick."
SCOTT,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,So you couldn't resist a wee wager.
SCOTT,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"The controls are all yours, and the bottle of scotch'll be in your room this evening if you can handle 'em."
SCOTT,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I don't know!
SCOTT,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"We need some repairs, sir, but the ship is intact."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Thank you, Mister Marvick."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I shall be wearing the visor.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It has proved effective for Vulcans.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I shall endeavour to keep it under control.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Welcome aboard, Ambassador Kollos."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I am First Officer Spock.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Captain Kirk, we are ready."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Doctor Jones, may I congratulate you on your assignment with Ambassador Kollos."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I'm sure you will find it a fascinating experience.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No one ever has.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I was referring to mind-links I had attempted with members of other species.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I was unable to accept.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,My life is here.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Spock to Bridge.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We have arrived at the Ambassador's quarters.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I would appreciate an opportunity to exchange greetings with the Ambassador.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I almost envy you your assignment.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Not correct, Doctor, although I am aware of your mind attempting to contact mine."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Were you born a telepath?
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I understand.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,May I show you to your quarters?
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I understand.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Our ship's surgeon often makes the same complaint.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Do call when you are ready.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Why, thank you, Captain."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"On the contrary, Doctor, I would say that Doctor Jones was indeed fortunate."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Doctor Jones was born a telepath, Captain."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,What most humans generally find impossible to understand is the need to shut out the bedlam of other people's thoughts and emotions.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"As a matter of fact, I wear it this evening to honour you, Doctor."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I see, Doctor McCoy, you still subscribe to the outmoded notion, promulgated by your ancient Greeks, that what is good must also be beautiful."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I'll escort you to your quarters.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I genuinely intended to honour her, Captain."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Good evening, gentlemen."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Do you know whether he saw the Medusan?
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Then insanity will surely be the result, Captain."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Dangerous insanity.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Trying, Captain."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Mister Chekov, your assistance, please."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"We are evidently far outside our own galaxy, judging from the lack of traceable reference points."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"When we exceeded warp speed factor nine point five, we apparently entered a space-time continuum."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Impossible to calculate.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We lack data to analyse.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Our instruments appear to be functioning normally, but what they tell us makes no sense."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Our records are clear up to the point at which we left our galaxy.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Unfortunately, we lack reference points on which to plot a return course."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"We experienced extreme sensory distortion, and we shall do so again if we attempt to use warp speed."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,And we cannot re-cross the barrier using sub light speed.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"An entertaining suggestion, Mister Chekov, but not very helpful."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Very possibly.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,The Medusan sensory system is radically different from ours.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Perhaps for the purpose of this emergency I might become Kollos.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,A fusion.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,A mind-link to create a double entity.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Each of us would enjoy the knowledge and sensory capabilities of both.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We will function as one being.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,If the link is successful there will be a tendency to lose separate identity.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,A necessary risk.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Of course, Doctor Jones will not wish to give me permission to accomplish the mind-link."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Doctor Jones has shown reluctance every time I've asked to converse with Kollos.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"In some ways, she is still most human, Captain, particularly in the depth of her jealousy."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Not sufficient.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Her telepathic powers are formidable.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"If it is at all possible, her mind must be so engaged that no thought of what I am doing shall intrude."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,The Enterprise is at stake.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It is not possible for you to be involved.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,This is not a duty that you can assume.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I am aware of the fact that your telepathic competence might be superior to mine, but there's a more important factor."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,The object is to pilot this ship.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,That is something you cannot do.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Evidently a highly sophisticated sensor web.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"My compliments to you, and to your dressmaker."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,An elegant solution.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"but I fail to understand why you apparently try to conceal your blindness, Doctor Jones."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,This is delightful.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I know you.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,All of you.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"James Kirk, Captain and friend for many years."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"And Leonard McCoy, also of long acquaintance."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"And Uhura, whose name means freedom."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Are you surprised to find that I've read Byron, Doctor?"
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,In part.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"That is, part of us is known to you as Kollos."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Ah, Miranda."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,There you are.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,My world is next for us.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Captain Kirk, I speak for all of us you call Medusans."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I am sorry for the trouble I've brought to your ship.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,And now to the business at hand.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"With your permission, Captain."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Co-ordination is completed.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Warp one in six seconds.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Five, four, three, two, one, zero."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Position report, please, Mister Chekov."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Thank you, Mister Chekov."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Manoeuvre completed, Captain."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,How compact your bodies are.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,And what a variety of senses you have.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"This thing you call language though, most remarkable."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You depend on it for so very much.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,But is any one of you really its master?
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"But most of all, the aloneness."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You are so alone.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You live out your lives in this shell of flesh.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Self-contained, separate."
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,How lonely you are.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,How terribly lonely.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,So soon?
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You're a wise Captain.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I rejoice in your knowledge and in your achievement.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,And the ways our differences combine to create meaning and beauty.
SPOCK,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Live long and prosper, Miranda."
UHURA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Channel open, sir."
UHURA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"They don't answer, Captain."
UHURA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Captain, I have engineering now."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I'm Doctor Jones.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"(Spock removes his visor) The ambassador is most honoured to meet you, Mister Spock."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Thank you, but the assignment's not yet definite."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It will depend upon my ability to achieve a true mind-link with the Ambassador.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I wasn't aware that anyone had ever achieved a mind-link with the Medusans.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I've heard, Mister Spock, that you turned down the assignment with the Ambassador."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I'm sure the Ambassador would be charmed.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I see in your mind that you are tempted to take my place.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Yes.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,That is why I had to study on Vulcan.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I think I'll stay here a bit.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Ambassador Kollos often finds the process of transport somewhat unsettling.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,What is it he sees when he looks at you?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I must know!
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"They, Captain?"
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Now that you ask, yes."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Thank you, Captain."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I spent four years on Vulcan studying their mental discipline.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Joy can be many things, Doctor."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"On Vulcan, I learned to do things impossible to learn anywhere else."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"How not to read them, Captain."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Vulcan was necessary to my sanity.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Indeed?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,The key is the mind-link that I learned on Vulcan.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Once we have learned the technique of forming a corporate intelligence with the Medusans, the designers, that's where Larry comes in, can work on adapting instruments."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"How can one so full of joy and the love of life as you, Doctor, condemn yourself to look upon disease and suffering for the rest of your life?"
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Can we allow that, gentlemen?"
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,There's somebody nearby thinking of murder.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It's gone now.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It isn't there anymore.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Captain, would you mind if I said goodnight?"
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Thank you, gentlemen."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You make a choice impossible.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Please, stay and enjoy yourselves."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It was a delightful dinner.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Of course, Doctor McCoy."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Please don't worry about me.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Who is it?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It's late.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,All right.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Come in, then."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I rather enjoyed it.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I'll be further away than that soon.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Now, we've been over this time and time again."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Larry, please, try to understand."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I've been honest with you.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I simply cannot love you the way you want me to.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,And I'm going away with Kollos.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,That's final.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I think you'd better leave now.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,So it's you!
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I didn't know that it was you before.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Who is it you want to kill, Larry?"
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Is it me?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You mustn't keep this to yourself.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I want to help you.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"No harm has come to the Ambassador, Captain."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Larry Marvick.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Yes, he did."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I'll go with you.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I must.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I can reach his mind.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Yes, Larry."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I'm here.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I am here, Larry."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I can see what he sees.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"No, don't."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Don't think of it!
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I've never been to Earth.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,What lovely flowers.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,May I touch them?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,They have no scent.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It doesn't hurt anymore.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I didn't want his love.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I couldn't return it.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Shall I tell you what human companionship means to me?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"A struggle, a defence against the emotions of others."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"At times, the emotions burst in on me."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Hatred, desire, envy, pity."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Pity is the worst of all.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I agree with the Vulcans.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Violent emotion is a kind of insanity.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Perhaps.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Ugly.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,What is ugly?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Who is to say whether Kollos is too ugly to bear or too beautiful to bear?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I see you're a very complicated man.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Kollos, no."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You mustn't let him!
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Let me go.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You have no idea what a dangerous thing Spock is planning.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,We must stop him!
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Let me go!
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Why?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I've already committed myself to mind-link when Kollos and I reach the Medusan vessel.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Why put yourself in jeopardy?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Then teach me to operate the ship.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I can memorise instantly.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Pity, which I hate."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Do you think you can gather more information with your eyes than I can with my sensors?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I could play tennis with you, Captain Kirk."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I might even beat you.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I am standing exactly one metre, four centimetres from the door."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Can you judge distance that accurately?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I can even tell you how fast your heart is beating.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I won't let you.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,It seems I have no choice but to obey you.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,'Tis new to thee.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Who is it?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Doctor McCoy?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Who's there?
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I have no news for you, Captain."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Only that his life processes are ebbing.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Why, what I can, of course."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,No doubt you think I can wake him with a kiss.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,But he is a Vulcan.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Face reality, Captain."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,His mind has gone down almost too far even for me to reach!
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,That's a lie!
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You're insane!
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,That's a lie!
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Liar!
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Sadistic, filthy liar!"
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Don't say anymore, please!"
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Please go away!
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Now, Spock, this is to the death."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Or to life for both of us.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I am one with Kollos.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"We come to the end of an eventful trip, Captain."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Well, I have you to thank for my future."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Your words enabled me to see.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I suppose it has thorns.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,(to Spock) I know now the great joy you felt when you joined minds with Kollos.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I understand, Mister Spock."
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,The glory of creation is in its infinite diversity.
MIRANDA,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Peace and long life, Spock."
SULU,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Warp factor two, sir."
SULU,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I don't believe this myself, Captain, but we're travelling at warp factor eight point five."
SULU,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Warp factor nine and accelerating.
SULU,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Aye, sir."
SULU,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Captain.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You poor girl.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Vulcan is not my idea of fun.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I don't care how benevolent the Medusans are supposed to be.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Isn't it suicidal to deal with something ugly enough to drive men mad?
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Why do you do it?
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,How can one so beautiful condemn herself to look upon ugliness the rest of her life?
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Will we allow it, gentlemen?"
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"To whatever you want the most, Miranda."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Are you sure you're well enough to find your way alone?
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Now, where I come from, that's what we call a lady."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Well, she's not just another girl, Captain."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Don't make that mistake.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I don't know what it is, exactly."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,She seems very vulnerable.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Of course.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,But there's something so very disturbing about her.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Good night, Jim."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"He's dead, Jim."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I have the autopsy report on Marvick.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Heart action stopped, cause unknown."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Respiration stopped, cause unknown."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Brain activity stopped, cause."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Shall I go on?
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I mean he evidently could not live with what he saw.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I don't think she'll want anyone to intrude in the kind of rapport she has with Kollos.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Now wait a minute.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I realise that you can do almost anything a sighted person can do, but you can't pilot a starship."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I'm sorry, Miranda, but you must be realistic."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"You are blind, and there are some things you simply cannot do."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Please.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Do not fight us like this, Doctor Jones."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I appeal to you as a colleague.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Do not oppose us.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,She would have told you herself if she had wanted you to know.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,I respect her privacy.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,That's not Spock.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,That's Spock!
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"But, Jim."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,He's hardly breathing.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Help me get him to Sickbay.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Unless Miranda can look down into his mind and turn it outward to us, we will lose Spock."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Her knowledge of them may be the only thing that could save Spock's sanity, perhaps even his life."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,There's nothing else to be done.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,That's different.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Marvick loved her.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,But they weren't rivals in love.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Jim, you shouldn't go in there."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,What'd you say to her?
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,What's she doing in there?
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You look like you've paid a visit to the devil himself.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,You have what you wanted most.
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Well, I'm truly sorry that you're leaving."
MCCOY,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Goodbye.
JONES,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Or of their own thoughts and emotions.
JONES,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"I was just noticing your Vulcan IDIC, Mister Spock."
JONES,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Is it a reminder that, as a Vulcan, you can mind-link with the Medusans far better than I could?"
ALL,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Certainly not.
CHEKOV,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,And accelerating.
CHEKOV,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"A madman got us into this, and it's beginning to look as if only a madman can get us out."
CHEKOV,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,Our position?
CHEKOV,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Our position is so close to the point where we entered the void, the difference isn't worth mentioning."
CHEKOV,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"Bull's-eye, Mister Spock."
CHEKOV,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,"The new headings will be plotted in a minute, sir."
SPOCK,The Empath,Dust.
SPOCK,The Empath,Apparently these instruments have not been recently used.
SPOCK,The Empath,"At that rate, it will take exactly seventy four point one solar hours for the storm to pass."
SPOCK,The Empath,"Remember, Captain, what we see on this tape happened approximately three months ago."
SPOCK,The Empath,"Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,The Empath,It doesn't register.
SPOCK,The Empath,"Exactly one two one point three two metres beneath the planet surface, Captain."
SPOCK,The Empath,"Residual energy readings indicate we were beamed here by a matter-energy scrambler, similar to our own transporter mechanism."
SPOCK,The Empath,"Captain, picking up a life-form reading bearing four two mark seven."
SPOCK,The Empath,Negative.
SPOCK,The Empath,"Although humanoid, it is definitely not Homo Sapiens."
SPOCK,The Empath,Impossible.
SPOCK,The Empath,I can make no exact identification other than it being humanoid.
SPOCK,The Empath,"Approaching the life-form, Captain."
SPOCK,The Empath,Still undistinguishable.
SPOCK,The Empath,"The sand-bats of Manark Four appear to be inanimate rock crystals, Doctor, until they attack."
SPOCK,The Empath,"From what we know of the specific gravity and other environmental factors of this planet, a life-form such as hers could not evolve here."
SPOCK,The Empath,"An unlikely possibility, Captain, since over ninety eight percent of the known telepathic species send thoughts as well as receive them."
SPOCK,The Empath,She's made no attempt to contact our minds.
SPOCK,The Empath,"Gem, Doctor?"
SPOCK,The Empath,"Correct, Captain."
SPOCK,The Empath,"Captain, in that direction, my tricorder is now picking up a substantial collection of objects."
SPOCK,The Empath,Electronically sophisticated devices.
SPOCK,The Empath,I fail to understand why my tricorder previously gave no indication of them being out there.
SPOCK,The Empath,Fascinating.
SPOCK,The Empath,Readings indicate the passage to the surface lies in this direction.
SPOCK,The Empath,"Research station six kilometres in that direction, Captain."
SPOCK,The Empath,Just ahead.
SPOCK,The Empath,"I believe they were never actually present, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Empath,It was a mirage.
SPOCK,The Empath,"Captain, it was a mirage."
SPOCK,The Empath,"Captain, I request permission to be allowed"
SPOCK,The Empath,"Doctor, I'm unable to lock in on the previous readings."
SPOCK,The Empath,I can find no exit out of here.
SPOCK,The Empath,"Her withdrawal seemed to suggest the fear of death, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Empath,Only your urging her on caused her to continue.
SPOCK,The Empath,"Can you recall what happened, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Empath,"Captain, I noted that a light preceded you at the moment you were returned here from the Vian's laboratory."
SPOCK,The Empath,I conclude such a light is an energy transfer point linking this device to the power source.
SPOCK,The Empath,"If I can determine the frequency at which this device operates, I might be able to cause it to function for us."
SPOCK,The Empath,I would say so.
SPOCK,The Empath,"I do not know, Captain."
SPOCK,The Empath,"I'm beginning to understand its operating principles, but that is all."
SPOCK,The Empath,Some men spend the majority of their lives in mines beneath the surface.
SPOCK,The Empath,"I've recorded my principles and theories on the tricorder, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Empath,"Should the Vians return, there is sufficient data for you and the captain to complete the adjustments."
SPOCK,The Empath,"Possibly not, but you and the captain together will be able to do so."
SPOCK,The Empath,"How long will he be asleep, Doctor?"
SPOCK,The Empath,"I'm not criticizing your action, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Empath,"On the contrary, I'm quite grateful for it."
SPOCK,The Empath,The captain will be spared the strain of making so difficult a decision.
SPOCK,The Empath,You have simplified the situation considerably.
SPOCK,The Empath,"While the captain is asleep, I am in command."
SPOCK,The Empath,"When the Vians return, I shall go with them."
SPOCK,The Empath,Precisely.
SPOCK,The Empath,The choice would have been the captain's.
SPOCK,The Empath,Now it is mine.
SPOCK,The Empath,Your action is highly unethical.
SPOCK,The Empath,My decision stands.
SPOCK,The Empath,"I was convinced in the same way you were, Captain."
SPOCK,The Empath,By the good doctor's hypo.
SPOCK,The Empath,Hmm.
SPOCK,The Empath,A most unusual device.
SPOCK,The Empath,"It is a control unit, but not a control mechanism."
SPOCK,The Empath,"In fact, it is not a mechanical device."
SPOCK,The Empath,"This control is attuned to one electrical pattern of energy, the pattern produced by the mental impulses of the person who possesses it."
SPOCK,The Empath,It is activated solely by mental commands.
SPOCK,The Empath,I shall attempt to do so.
SPOCK,The Empath,"However, it is not possible to adjust the control to fit more than one pattern at a time."
SPOCK,The Empath,"I am, of course, most familiar with my own pattern."
SPOCK,The Empath,"Therefore, with your permission, I"
SPOCK,The Empath,Fascinating.
SPOCK,The Empath,They must have known we were capable of comprehending this control and making use of it.
SPOCK,The Empath,The only logical assumption is that they wish to let us go.
SPOCK,The Empath,"That is evidently their intention, Captain."
SPOCK,The Empath,"Indeed, the facts would indicate that she's essential to their purpose."
SPOCK,The Empath,"Completed, Captain."
SPOCK,The Empath,The adjustments are delicate.
SPOCK,The Empath,They may not survive more than even one use.
SPOCK,The Empath,"However, there should be sufficient energy to transfer us to the Enterprise."
SPOCK,The Empath,If you so desire.
SPOCK,The Empath,Severe heart damage.
SPOCK,The Empath,Signs of congestion in both lungs.
SPOCK,The Empath,Evidence of massive circulatory collapse.
SPOCK,The Empath,"He's dying, Jim."
SPOCK,The Empath,"We can make him comfortable, but that is all."
SPOCK,The Empath,Internal injuries.
SPOCK,The Empath,Bleeding in the chest and abdomen.
SPOCK,The Empath,Haemorrhage of the spleen and liver.
SPOCK,The Empath,Seventy percent kidney failure.
SPOCK,The Empath,It could happen anytime.
SPOCK,The Empath,I'm afraid not.
SPOCK,The Empath,"Uncertain, Captain."
SPOCK,The Empath,Dr. McCoy's analysis of her reaction assumes that her instinct for self-preservation would prevent it.
SPOCK,The Empath,"However, we cannot be positive."
SPOCK,The Empath,"What purpose can be served by the death of our friend, except to bring you pleasure?"
SPOCK,The Empath,Surely beings as advanced as yourselves know that your star system will soon be extinct.
SPOCK,The Empath,Your sun will nova.
SPOCK,The Empath,Then you also know that the millions of inhabitants on its planets are doomed.
SPOCK,The Empath,"You were correct, Captain."
SPOCK,The Empath,Everything that has occurred here has been caused to happen by them.
SPOCK,The Empath,"This has all been a great laboratory, and we have been the subjects of the test."
SPOCK,The Empath,"Captain, Dr. McCoy's life is not solely dependent on Gem."
SPOCK,The Empath,The Vians too must be capable of saving his life.
SPOCK,The Empath,Captain?
SPOCK,The Empath,The intensity of emotion is draining us and building up the force field.
SPOCK,The Empath,"It draws its energy from us, Captain."
SPOCK,The Empath,"In spite of what we see, all emotion must be suppressed."
SPOCK,The Empath,That might weaken the field.
SPOCK,The Empath,It is complete.
SPOCK,The Empath,Gem has earned the right of survival for her planet.
SPOCK,The Empath,She offered her life.
SPOCK,The Empath,"What is puzzling you, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Empath,"Captain, the element of chance can virtually be eliminated by a civilisation as advanced as the Vians."
SPOCK,The Empath,"Possibly, Captain."
SPOCK,The Empath,I shall certainly give the thought all the consideration it is due.
KIRK,The Empath,Record tape.
KIRK,The Empath,Maybe it'll tell us something about the personnel that lived here.
KIRK,The Empath,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Empath,"What is it, Enterprise?"
KIRK,The Empath,How bad?
KIRK,The Empath,Get that ship out of here.
KIRK,The Empath,Stay at minimum distance for absolute safety.
KIRK,The Empath,Negative.
KIRK,The Empath,We're staying here.
KIRK,The Empath,The atmosphere will protect us.
KIRK,The Empath,"Get that ship out of here, Mister Scott."
KIRK,The Empath,"Mister Spock, what about that tape?"
KIRK,The Empath,Where's does that sound coming from?
KIRK,The Empath,"Spock, can you pinpoint it?"
KIRK,The Empath,Bones!
KIRK,The Empath,Spock!
KIRK,The Empath,Spock.
KIRK,The Empath,Bones.
KIRK,The Empath,Where are we?
KIRK,The Empath,How did we get here?
KIRK,The Empath,No.
KIRK,The Empath,One of the missing scientists?
KIRK,The Empath,Identification?
KIRK,The Empath,Let's find out.
KIRK,The Empath,Phasers on stun.
KIRK,The Empath,What is it?
KIRK,The Empath,Be careful.
KIRK,The Empath,We're not going to hurt you.
KIRK,The Empath,Is this your home?
KIRK,The Empath,Do you live here?
KIRK,The Empath,"What about it, Spock?"
KIRK,The Empath,Analysis.
KIRK,The Empath,Are you responsible for bringing us here?
KIRK,The Empath,Don't be afraid.
KIRK,The Empath,"Bones, what's wrong with her?"
KIRK,The Empath,Explain.
KIRK,The Empath,"A race of mutes, like the civilisation on Gamma Vertis Four."
KIRK,The Empath,"Without speech, how's she going to be able to understand us?"
KIRK,The Empath,Unless she's a telepath.
KIRK,The Empath,Do you have any ideas?
KIRK,The Empath,I want to know why we're here.
KIRK,The Empath,I want to know what's going on.
KIRK,The Empath,And she knows.
KIRK,The Empath,I'm Captain
KIRK,The Empath,Who are you?
KIRK,The Empath,Why did you bring us here?
KIRK,The Empath,What do you intend to do with us?
KIRK,The Empath,"We come (moves forward and gets pushed back by a weapon) Since you already know who we are, you must also know that we come in peace."
KIRK,The Empath,Our prime directive specifically prohibits us from any interference.)
KIRK,The Empath,I can't seem to stand up.
KIRK,The Empath,Mister Spock there must be an exit other than the one we just saw.
KIRK,The Empath,Don't worry about me.
KIRK,The Empath,They may have hurt her.
KIRK,The Empath,Did they hurt you?
KIRK,The Empath,The pain is gone.
KIRK,The Empath,"She touched my head, and the pain is gone."
KIRK,The Empath,Thank you.
KIRK,The Empath,Details.
KIRK,The Empath,Well they're there now.
KIRK,The Empath,Let's go check them out.
KIRK,The Empath,(to Gem) Staying here alone could be dangerous.
KIRK,The Empath,Come with us.
KIRK,The Empath,"Bones Spock, come here."
KIRK,The Empath,I found our missing men.
KIRK,The Empath,Dead.
KIRK,The Empath,Another one of your experiments?
KIRK,The Empath,Yes.
KIRK,The Empath,Your time is running out.
KIRK,The Empath,This sun is about to nova.
KIRK,The Empath,"When it does, it'll destroy you, this planet, and this insane torture chamber."
KIRK,The Empath,Let's get out of here.
KIRK,The Empath,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Empath,"Kirk to Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,The Empath,Out of range.
KIRK,The Empath,"Readings, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Empath,Let's get there as fast as we can.
KIRK,The Empath,"If the Enterprise has a search party, it'll be there."
KIRK,The Empath,Spock!
KIRK,The Empath,Much further?
KIRK,The Empath,Scotty!
KIRK,The Empath,Stay there!
KIRK,The Empath,Come on!
KIRK,The Empath,Keep going.
KIRK,The Empath,What are you doing here?
KIRK,The Empath,Where's Scotty?
KIRK,The Empath,What about the others?
KIRK,The Empath,Very well.
KIRK,The Empath,Denied.
KIRK,The Empath,You have your orders.
KIRK,The Empath,What happened to my men?
KIRK,The Empath,"One specimen, you said."
KIRK,The Empath,One specimen!
KIRK,The Empath,What happened to my men?
KIRK,The Empath,Where are they?
KIRK,The Empath,Tell me!
KIRK,The Empath,You said you'd let them go!
KIRK,The Empath,What is it you want to know?
KIRK,The Empath,"You don't need any knowledge from us, yet you're willing to kill for it."
KIRK,The Empath,Is that what happened to Linke and Ozaba?
KIRK,The Empath,"Well, what did you expect from them?"
KIRK,The Empath,And what do you want from me?
KIRK,The Empath,Why?
KIRK,The Empath,What is it you hope to prove?
KIRK,The Empath,"If my death is to have any meaning, at least tell me what I'm dying for."
KIRK,The Empath,Will she live?
KIRK,The Empath,Can you explain what happened?
KIRK,The Empath,She weakened.
KIRK,The Empath,I could feel it.
KIRK,The Empath,Is her life in danger?
KIRK,The Empath,Could the strain really have killed her?
KIRK,The Empath,I'm tired.
KIRK,The Empath,"I remember the laboratory, and they wanted to know something."
KIRK,The Empath,"But I, I can't remember."
KIRK,The Empath,What's the matter with me?
KIRK,The Empath,You'll have to ask the Vians.
KIRK,The Empath,Will I live?
KIRK,The Empath,"No, he's right."
KIRK,The Empath,Continue.
KIRK,The Empath,Can you tap into it?
KIRK,The Empath,And get us out of here the same way we were brought in.
KIRK,The Empath,Then I would say proceed.
KIRK,The Empath,It is.
KIRK,The Empath,We will not co-operate.
KIRK,The Empath,"How's it coming, Spock?"
KIRK,The Empath,"Take it easy, Bones."
KIRK,The Empath,And space travel is?
KIRK,The Empath,The decision's mine.
KIRK,The Empath,"If there are any decisions to be made, I'll make them."
KIRK,The Empath,If and when it becomes necessary.
KIRK,The Empath,I don't need any
KIRK,The Empath,Why did you let him do it?
KIRK,The Empath,Anything?
KIRK,The Empath,What exactly is it?
KIRK,The Empath,"Can you adapt it, re-attune it to fit our brain pattern?"
KIRK,The Empath,"Do whatever you have to to make it work, Spock."
KIRK,The Empath,What disturbs me is why the Vians let us keep it.
KIRK,The Empath,And that we would use it to escape.
KIRK,The Empath,And they keep McCoy.
KIRK,The Empath,"(to Gem) Somehow, you're the crux, the focal point of all this."
KIRK,The Empath,"Even before we got here, she was a prisoner."
KIRK,The Empath,"They didn't hurt her, they didn't even threaten her."
KIRK,The Empath,"Yes, there is a purpose, but what is it?"
KIRK,The Empath,"Has all the pain and terror happened, or been made to happen for you?"
KIRK,The Empath,Will it take us to McCoy?
KIRK,The Empath,"The best defence is a strong offense, and I intend to start offending right now."
KIRK,The Empath,Aim for the lab.
KIRK,The Empath,Bones.
KIRK,The Empath,Spock.
KIRK,The Empath,Get him down.
KIRK,The Empath,His wrists.
KIRK,The Empath,(they lie him on a couch) His pulse is almost gone.
KIRK,The Empath,How is he?
KIRK,The Empath,Don't talk.
KIRK,The Empath,Don't speak.
KIRK,The Empath,Take it easy until we get you back to the ship.
KIRK,The Empath,What is it?
KIRK,The Empath,What's the matter?
KIRK,The Empath,You don't know.
KIRK,The Empath,You're not a doctor.
KIRK,The Empath,How long?
KIRK,The Empath,Can't we do something?
KIRK,The Empath,"Gem might be able to help him, the way she helped me, but could his nearness to death also kill her?"
KIRK,The Empath,"If she could just strengthen him and keep him from sinking further into death, we might be able to save him."
KIRK,The Empath,She can save his life.
KIRK,The Empath,Let us help her to go to him.
KIRK,The Empath,"What purpose can all this serve, except the fulfilment of some need of yours?"
KIRK,The Empath,Patient?
KIRK,The Empath,Our friend is dying.
KIRK,The Empath,This arena of death that you have devised for your pleasure.
KIRK,The Empath,Will it prevent this catastrophe?
KIRK,The Empath,How will the death of our friend serve this purpose?
KIRK,The Empath,We were?
KIRK,The Empath,What could she learn from us?
KIRK,The Empath,Then you cannot let him die.
KIRK,The Empath,"Yes, Bones."
KIRK,The Empath,What is it?
KIRK,The Empath,"Yes, I know."
KIRK,The Empath,I'll try.
KIRK,The Empath,Yes.
KIRK,The Empath,"(Spock takes the device from Thann, and Kirk is free too.)"
KIRK,The Empath,Spock.
KIRK,The Empath,You must save the life of our friend.
KIRK,The Empath,"If death is all you understand, here are four lives for you."
KIRK,The Empath,We will not leave our friend.
KIRK,The Empath,You've lost the capacity to feel the emotions you brought Gem here to experience.
KIRK,The Empath,You don't understand what it is to live.
KIRK,The Empath,Love and compassion are dead in you.
KIRK,The Empath,You're nothing but intellect.
KIRK,The Empath,Strange.
KIRK,The Empath,"I'm not puzzled, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Empath,I am awed.
KIRK,The Empath,"No, no."
KIRK,The Empath,I wasn't thinking of Gem.
KIRK,The Empath,I was thinking of that fantastic element of chance that out in limitless space we should come together with Gem.
KIRK,The Empath,"What, Scott?"
KIRK,The Empath,"Yes, she was all that."
KIRK,The Empath,And whether the Vians bought her or found her makes little difference.
KIRK,The Empath,She was of great value.
KIRK,The Empath,"Mister Spock, can you be prevailed upon to bring them the news?"
KIRK,The Empath,"Mister Sulu, ahead warp factor two."
SCOTT,The Empath,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,The Empath,"Come in, please."
SCOTT,The Empath,"Scott here, sir."
SCOTT,The Empath,Our instruments have picked up a gigantic solar flare
SCOTT,The Empath,With very high levels of cosmic rays accompanying it.
SCOTT,The Empath,An enormous one.
SCOTT,The Empath,Our sensors indicate the cosmic ray concentration measures three point five one on the Ritter scale.
SCOTT,The Empath,"That'll play the very devil with the crew, as well as the ship."
SCOTT,The Empath,"Aye, aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Empath,We'll beam you up in
SCOTT,The Empath,"Very well, sir."
SCOTT,The Empath,Scott out.
SCOTT,The Empath,"Mister Sulu, will you give us an estimate of how much longer we'll have until those solar flares will subside?"
SCOTT,The Empath,Aye.
SCOTT,The Empath,"Well, as long as we're stuck out here, we might as well relax until the storm passes."
SCOTT,The Empath,That's not likely.
SCOTT,The Empath,The planet's atmosphere will give them ample protection.
SCOTT,The Empath,"And if I know Captain Kirk, he'll be more worried about us than we are about him."
SCOTT,The Empath,"Not to dispute your computer, Mister Spock, but from little what you've told me, I would say she was a pearl of great price."
SCOTT,The Empath,Do you not know the story of the merchant?
SCOTT,The Empath,"The merchant, who when he found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it."
SCOTT,The Empath,Perhaps the Vulcans should hear about this.
LINKE,The Empath,I don't think I can stand another week in this godforsaken place.
LINKE,The Empath,Who's out there?
OZABA,The Empath,In his hand are the deep places of the earth.
OZABA,The Empath,"Psalm ninety five, verse four."
OZABA,The Empath,Looks like he was listening.
MCCOY,The Empath,What happened to them?
MCCOY,The Empath,"That's a nasty cut, Jim."
MCCOY,The Empath,Does it hurt?
MCCOY,The Empath,She seems harmless enough.
MCCOY,The Empath,"She's a mute, Jim."
MCCOY,The Empath,"No vocal cords, not even vestigals."
MCCOY,The Empath,And I don't think it's a pathological condition.
MCCOY,The Empath,She appears to be perfectly healthy.
MCCOY,The Empath,"As for the other, her lack of vocal cords could be physiologically normal for her species, whatever that is."
MCCOY,The Empath,"That's my observation, for whatever it's worth."
MCCOY,The Empath,"We can't keep referring to her as she, as if she weren't here."
MCCOY,The Empath,"Well, I don't know about you, but I'm going to call her Gem."
MCCOY,The Empath,"Well, that's better than 'Hey, you.'"
MCCOY,The Empath,Don't fight the force field.
MCCOY,The Empath,There's something about it that upsets the body metabolism.
MCCOY,The Empath,"Do you feel all right, Jim?"
MCCOY,The Empath,The wound is completely healed.
MCCOY,The Empath,"It fits, Jim."
MCCOY,The Empath,She must be an empath.
MCCOY,The Empath,"Her nervous system is so sensitive, highly responsive that she can actually feel our emotional and physical reactions."
MCCOY,The Empath,They become part of her.
MCCOY,The Empath,Look at this stuff.
MCCOY,The Empath,"Jim, Spock."
MCCOY,The Empath,We've seen the results of some of your tests.
MCCOY,The Empath,"Hey, Jim, look."
MCCOY,The Empath,Scotty and a search party.
MCCOY,The Empath,Scotty!
MCCOY,The Empath,We're coming!
MCCOY,The Empath,Where'd they go?
MCCOY,The Empath,Where's Kirk?
MCCOY,The Empath,Jim.
MCCOY,The Empath,You can't go back there.
MCCOY,The Empath,You'll end up like the other two.
MCCOY,The Empath,"But, Captain"
MCCOY,The Empath,"Come on, Spock, the passageway was there before."
MCCOY,The Empath,It's got to be there.
MCCOY,The Empath,Captain!
MCCOY,The Empath,"(Kirk wakes) Jim, what is it?"
MCCOY,The Empath,What have they done to you?
MCCOY,The Empath,Help him.
MCCOY,The Empath,Don't be afraid to help him.
MCCOY,The Empath,Jim.
MCCOY,The Empath,You lie still.
MCCOY,The Empath,I'll check her out right away.
MCCOY,The Empath,She seems fine now.
MCCOY,The Empath,Complete empathy.
MCCOY,The Empath,She must be a totally functional empath.
MCCOY,The Empath,"Her nervous system actually connected to yours to counteract the worst of your symptoms and with her strength, she virtually sustained your body's physiological reactions."
MCCOY,The Empath,"It's impossible to say yet, but supplying your body with life support did drain her."
MCCOY,The Empath,That's true.
MCCOY,The Empath,Fear would naturally be her first reaction.
MCCOY,The Empath,Perhaps she doesn't know our captain well enough yet to offer up her life for him.
MCCOY,The Empath,Oh yes.
MCCOY,The Empath,"However, I'd assume that her instinct for self-preservation would take over to prevent it."
MCCOY,The Empath,How do you feel?
MCCOY,The Empath,Take it easy.
MCCOY,The Empath,You have all the symptoms of the bends.
MCCOY,The Empath,Nitrogen bubbles in your blood caused the pain.
MCCOY,The Empath,Now how would one get the bends down here?
MCCOY,The Empath,"Well, you could use some time in a decompression chamber."
MCCOY,The Empath,"But otherwise, I'd say your recovery is about miraculous."
MCCOY,The Empath,"I wish I could take the credit for it, but she did the work."
MCCOY,The Empath,"Spock, why do you have to get so analytical at a time like"
MCCOY,The Empath,"Spock, It won't be long before the Vians come back."
MCCOY,The Empath,You better find out how that thing works and soon.
MCCOY,The Empath,Men weren't intended to live this far underground.
MCCOY,The Empath,It's just not natural.
MCCOY,The Empath,"I'm a doctor, not a coal miner."
MCCOY,The Empath,I'm not a mechanic.
MCCOY,The Empath,I couldn't get that thing to work no matter how many notes you left.
MCCOY,The Empath,"In any case, Spock, you're the logical one to leave with the captain."
MCCOY,The Empath,I'm still Chief Medical Officer of the Enterprise.
MCCOY,The Empath,I'll tell you what you need and when you need it.
MCCOY,The Empath,Would you rather have the bends?
MCCOY,The Empath,That's it.
MCCOY,The Empath,Just lie down and relax.
MCCOY,The Empath,"Between the emotional strain and that attack of bends, he's in pretty bad shape."
MCCOY,The Empath,How?
MCCOY,The Empath,"You mean, if I hadn't given him that shot"
MCCOY,The Empath,"Not this time, Spock."
MCCOY,The Empath,The choice has been made.
MCCOY,The Empath,(to Gem) You stay here with my friends.
MCCOY,The Empath,They'll take care of you.
MCCOY,The Empath,Do you understand?
MCCOY,The Empath,Get on with it.
MCCOY,The Empath,I
MCCOY,The Empath,"He's right, Jim."
MCCOY,The Empath,Being a doctor has its drawbacks.
MCCOY,The Empath,"I always wondered why I (coughs, so they turn him on his side) Thanks."
MCCOY,The Empath,"The correct medical phrase, ay, Spock?"
MCCOY,The Empath,"You've got a a good bedside manner, Spock."
MCCOY,The Empath,Don't touch me.
MCCOY,The Empath,Stay away.
MCCOY,The Empath,Jim.
MCCOY,The Empath,Spock.
MCCOY,The Empath,Are you here?
MCCOY,The Empath,Don't let her touch me.
MCCOY,The Empath,She'll die.
MCCOY,The Empath,"Jim, I can't destroy life, even if it's to save my own."
MCCOY,The Empath,I can't.
MCCOY,The Empath,You know that.
MCCOY,The Empath,I can't let you do it.
MCCOY,The Empath,"I'm with you, Captain."
MCCOY,The Empath,She awed me.
MCCOY,The Empath,"Well, personally, I find it fascinating that with all their scientific knowledge and advances, that it was good old-fashioned human emotion that they valued the most."
THANN,The Empath,"We are aware of your identity, Captain."
THANN,The Empath,Delay us no longer.
THANN,The Empath,They love life greatly to struggle so.
THANN,The Empath,Captain Kirk!
THANN,The Empath,We have decided that one specimen will be sufficient.
THANN,The Empath,You will come with us.
THANN,The Empath,"Indeed, the prime ingredient."
THANN,The Empath,We did not kill them.
THANN,The Empath,Their own fears killed them.
THANN,The Empath,"If you live, you will have your answer."
THANN,The Empath,We find it necessary to have the co-operation of one of your men in our efforts.
THANN,The Empath,"Come, then."
THANN,The Empath,All must proceed without interference.
THANN,The Empath,Be patient.
THANN,The Empath,Perhaps.
THANN,The Empath,We know.
THANN,The Empath,"If Gem's planet is the one that will be saved, we must make certain beyond any doubt whatsoever they are worthy of survival."
THANN,The Empath,Her planet will be fortunate.
THANN,The Empath,Time grows short.
THANN,The Empath,No.
THANN,The Empath,We only created the circumstances.
THANN,The Empath,That was necessary.
THANN,The Empath,Behold.
THANN,The Empath,That is most significant.
THANN,The Empath,An instinct new to the essence of her being is generating.
THANN,The Empath,She is afraid.
THANN,The Empath,We have failed?
THANN,The Empath,True.
LAL,The Empath,We are Vians.
LAL,The Empath,Do not interfere.
LAL,The Empath,"Not quite, Doctor."
LAL,The Empath,The field draws its energy from your bodies.
LAL,The Empath,"The more you resist, the stronger the force field becomes."
LAL,The Empath,Sufficient.
LAL,The Empath,We are on schedule.
LAL,The Empath,Some further simple tests are necessary.
LAL,The Empath,You're wrong.
LAL,The Empath,Their own imperfections killed them.
LAL,The Empath,They were not fit subjects.
LAL,The Empath,Come.
LAL,The Empath,Time is short.
LAL,The Empath,Their will to survive is great.
LAL,The Empath,The prime ingredient.
LAL,The Empath,We've no interest in them.
LAL,The Empath,They may go.
LAL,The Empath,They are safe.
LAL,The Empath,We seek no information as you mean.
LAL,The Empath,Your civilisation is yet too immature to have knowledge valuable to us.
LAL,The Empath,We've already observed the intensity of your passions and gauged your capacity to love others.
LAL,The Empath,Now we want you to reveal to us your courage and strength of will.
LAL,The Empath,You are called Captain.
LAL,The Empath,You are responsible for the lives of your crew.
LAL,The Empath,Is this correct?
LAL,The Empath,"When we resume our interrogations, you will decide which of your men we shall use."
LAL,The Empath,It is essential.
LAL,The Empath,There is an eighty seven percent chance that the doctor will die.
LAL,The Empath,"And while Commander Spock's life is not in danger, the possibility is ninety three percent that he will suffer brain damage, resulting in permanent insanity."
LAL,The Empath,"Doctor, please understand that if there was any other way to accomplish our purpose"
LAL,The Empath,No interference will be permitted.
LAL,The Empath,She must not be urged or forced to take action.
LAL,The Empath,The purpose that brought us together
LAL,The Empath,"We have but one need left in life, and that is to see the completion of the final moment of our test."
LAL,The Empath,That is why we are here.
LAL,The Empath,"No, it will not, but it may save Gem's planet."
LAL,The Empath,"Of all the planets of Minara, we have the power to transport the inhabitants of only one to safety."
LAL,The Empath,"His death will not serve it, but her willingness to give her life for him will."
LAL,The Empath,You were her teachers.
LAL,The Empath,Your will to survive.
LAL,The Empath,Your love of life.
LAL,The Empath,Your passion to know.
LAL,The Empath,They are recorded in her being.
LAL,The Empath,Each of you is willing to give his life for the others.
LAL,The Empath,We must now find out whether that instinct has been transmitted to Gem.
LAL,The Empath,Your actions were spontaneous.
LAL,The Empath,Everything that is truest and best in all species of beings has been revealed by you.
LAL,The Empath,Those are the qualities that make a civilisation worthy to survive.
LAL,The Empath,Compassion for another is becoming part of her functioning life system.
LAL,The Empath,She's saving herself.
LAL,The Empath,She does not yet have the instinct to save her people.
LAL,The Empath,No.
LAL,The Empath,"No, not yet."
LAL,The Empath,His death is not important.
LAL,The Empath,We must wait to see whether her instinct for self-sacrifice has become stronger than her instinct for self-preservation.
LAL,The Empath,You cannot use our powers to change what is happening.
LAL,The Empath,No.
LAL,The Empath,We will not.
LAL,The Empath,Her instinct must be developed to the fullest.
LAL,The Empath,The test must be complete.
LAL,The Empath,To offer is not proof enough.
LAL,The Empath,Farewell.
SULU,The Empath,"Aye, sir."
SULU,The Empath,Readings now indicate two point seven two one on the Ritter scale.
SULU,The Empath,"At the present rate of decrease, we'll have to wait at least seventeen hours more before we can even attempt to enter orbit."
SULU,The Empath,The storm's already lasted four hours longer than we've anticipated.
SULU,The Empath,Do you suppose our landing party could be in any danger?
SULU,The Empath,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,The Empath,Warp factor two.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Captain, we are registering very curious readings from all
sensors."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",I cannot.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","According to our instruments, space itself is
literally breaking up."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","There is no known phenomenon which would account
for these readings."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Negative.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",I have run a complete check on all systems.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",There is virtually no sensor contact.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",No mass analysis.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","No trace
of radiation."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","We see it, but our sensors indicate it is not there."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Absolutely no record of such an occurrence, Ensign."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","The ship is still functioning, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","It is logical to assume
the mutineers are somewhere aboard."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Captain, there is no sign of life aboard this vessel."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Captain, the Defiant's sensors correspond
with an extremely high degree of correlation to those of the
Enterprise."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Affirmative.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Request permission to remain, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I could be completing the
data."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Captain, there is a chance"
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Energise.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Negative.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Compute the next period of spatial interphase.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","We must try, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","The fabric of space is very weak
here."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","If we disturb it, there will be no chance of retrieving the
Captain alive."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Well, picture it this way, Mister Chekov."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","We exist in a universe
which co-exists with a multitude of others in the same physical space."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","At certain brief periods of time, an area of their space overlaps an
area of ours."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","That is a time of interphase, during which we can connect
with the Defiant's universe."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Yes.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","However, the dimensional structure of each universe is
totally dissimilar."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Any use of power disturbs it.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","If we are not
extremely careful, we shall lose the Captain and become trapped
ourselves."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Chekov!
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Chekov!
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Security guards to the Bridge.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I was attempting to explain to Mister Chekov the nature of our
problems in this situation when he attacked."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Lieutenant Uhura is correct.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",There was murderous fury in Chekov.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",The same fury which was evident in the Defiant.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Is there anything you need to isolate the cause?
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","If we are to recover the Captain, we must not move."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Approximately two hours before the attempt can be made.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","The Captain was caught in our transporter beam when the Defiant
phased out."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","It is possible he was spared the shock of transition and
survived."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","However, if we are to recover him, we must catch him at the
precise moment during the next interphase, or he will die."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","And there
can be no margin for error."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","His environmental unit can provide
breathable air for no more than three point six two hours."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Status, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Lieutenant Uhura, signal Red Alert."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Transfer to main viewer.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Spock, in command of the Federation star ship Enterprise."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Commander, according to the Federation, this area is free space."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",We are not interested in your display of force.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","The Enterprise
is responding to a distress signal from one of our ships and is
currently engaged in rescue operations."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Do you wish to assist us?
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",The other ship is interspatially trapped.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","It should reappear in
one hour and fifty three minutes."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",We request you stand by until then.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Bridge to transporter room.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Ready for interphase in twenty seconds.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Lock on to Captain Kirk's co-ordinates
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","And prepare to bring him aboard, Mister
Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Bring him aboard, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Well, keep trying, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Lieutenant Sulu, evaluation."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","It's possible the Tholian entry into the area has disturbed the
space, and if that has occurred"
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Spock here.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Negative, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Theoretically it already has happened,
Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","However, the ship's sensors are not
responding as predicted."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I did, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","The space was disturbed by
the Tholians."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Not at this interphase.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I shall have to recalculate to determine
when the next interphase will occur."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","They do not take place at regular
intervals."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I have confidence that you will soon isolate the cause, Doctor,
and prevent further spread of the affliction."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",The renowned Tholian punctuality.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Engineering, hold power steady and cut off all unnecessary
expenditures."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Sulu, divert all but emergency maintenance power
to the shields."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Spock here.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Understood.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to the Tholian
ship."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Sulu, lock in phaser tracking controls."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Ready, Mister Sulu?"
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Fire.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Engineering, status report."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Mister Scott?
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Can you estimate minimum time required for repair?
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",The decision to fight was logical.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Lack of time prevented any
other course of action."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",The Tholian ship had to be disabled.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Doctor, I hardly believe this is the time for comparisons."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Please go to your laboratory and search for an antidote to the effects
of this space."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","That is your primary task, since we must remain here."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Negative.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Lieutenant Uhura, can you open a channel to the
approaching vessel?"
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Distance, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Sulu, I shall run an analysis on those filaments."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Tie in
all sensors to the ship's library computer console."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Switch scanners.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",There's no analogy to this structure in Federation technology.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","It is, however, an energy field, and if the Tholians are successful in
completing this structure before we have completed our repairs, we
shall not see home again."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Doctor, your last report on an antidote on the effects of this
space was negative."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",The urgency requires your personal attention in the laboratory.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","A few hours ago, the Captain elected to remain on board the
Defiant so that three members of this crew would have the best chance
of returning safely to the Enterprise."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","His concern was not only for
them, but for all the members of the crew of this ship."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","You all know
the sequence of events."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",We were fired upon by the Tholian ship.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","At that
time, Captain Kirk may have been alive."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I deemed it necessary to return
the Tholian fire for the safety of the Enterprise."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","The Tholian ship has
been disabled."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","But as a result of the battle, we must accept the fact
that Captain Kirk is no longer alive."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I shall not attempt to voice the quality of respect and
admiration which Captain Kirk commanded."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Each of you must evaluate the
loss in the privacy of your own thoughts."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","It can wait, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","My duties require my immediate presence on
the bridge."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","It will wait for a more suitable moment, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","The mental and physical state of this crew are your
responsibility, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","At the moment, they are your top priority."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","We came here for a specific purpose, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","The Captain would have remained to recover a crew member at the
risk of his own life or even his own ship."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I need not explain my rationale to you or any other member of
this crew."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",There is a margin of variation in any experiment.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","While
there was a chance, I was bound legally and morally to ascertain the
Captain's status."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","That is enough, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",We both have other things to do.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","You will return to your duty as soon as we've discharged our
responsibilities here."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Doctor, I am in command of the Enterprise."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","If you believe I have acted irregularly, then relieve me of
duty."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",That is your prerogative as medical officer of this ship.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","What would you have me say, Doctor?"
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Spock here.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",I shall be there shortly.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Doctor, I believe we each have our
respective tasks to complete before the Tholians complete theirs."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Spock here.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Proceed, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Report to Doctor McCoy all symptoms noted
prior to the attack."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Spock out.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Bridge.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Spock here.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Negative.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","We are relatively stable at the
moment."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Why do you ask?
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","What is it, Mister Scott?"
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Mister Scott?
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Report to the bridge immediately.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to
see."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I was merely stating a fact, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Please leave that to me, Doctor McCoy."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I realise that the crew
are your prime concern."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",You can best serve them in your laboratory.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I
urge you to confine yourself to it until a remedy has been found."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I understand, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I'm sure the Captain would simply have
said forget it, Bones."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Captain?
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Captain?
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Captain.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Exactly.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",But the Captain remained.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Only the overlap time
changed."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",The next interphase will occur here.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Can you be ready?
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","It will have to do, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",(door buzzer) Come.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","You've found the antidote, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Ensign Chekov was affected so early.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Has he responded to it?
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Theragen?
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",A nerve gas used by the Klingons.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","If I remember correctly, it caused fatality only when used in
pure form."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Welcome back, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Your absence was keenly felt, Mister Chekov."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Estimated time for completion of the Tholian web.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Are the ships computers programmed for entry into interspace?
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Spock to engineering.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Prepare for interphase in
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Fifteen seconds.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Stand by with full power.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",It will have to do.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Ready to transport on my order.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Try to maintain position Mister Sulu.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Engineering, bring ship's power up to full capability."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Negative, Ensign."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Utilising ship's power has thrown us clear of
it."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Compute the distance from the original location.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","We shall soon see, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Good.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Since the Captain was locked into our transporter beam
when we were thrown clear of the interphase area, he should've been
drawn here with us."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",Spock to transporter room.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",The Captain's oxygen supply is running out now.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Are you
standing by with a hypo of tri-ox compound for him?"
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Prepare to transport on the Captain's
co-ordinates on my order."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","I see him, Ensign."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",I see him.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Now, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","None worth reporting, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Only such minor disturbances as are inevitable when humans are
involved."
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","Orders, Captain?"
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web",No.
SPOCK,"The
Tholian Web","You see, the crisis was upon us, and then passed so quickly,
Captain, that we"
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Specify.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",What about sensor failure?
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",How bad is it?
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","How about it, Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Explain.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",The Defiant!
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Sulu, impulse engines only."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Close to
transporter range."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Lieutenant, open up a hailing frequency."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Good.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Maintain position.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Spock, Mister Chekov, come with
me."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Doctor McCoy, report to the transporter room immediately."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Scotty,
you have the conn."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Energise.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Use the ship's sensors to locate them.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Prepare to beam over a full security squad on my orders.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Odd, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Very odd.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Spock, you stay here with me."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Chekov, get down to Engineering and life support systems."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Doctor McCoy,
check out the Sickbay."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Cancel the security squad
and stand by for further instructions."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Report, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Get back up here.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Kirk to McCoy.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Bones, can you tell me what they all died of?"
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",They what?
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Could mental disease have infected all of the
crew?"
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Bones, what is it?"
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Bones, what is it?"
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Answer me!
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Answer me!
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Get up here on the double.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","You mean what happened to the Defiant might be happening to the
Enterprise?"
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Mister Scott.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Scott, stand by to beam us back."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Why not?
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",What's happened?
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Chekov, McCoy, prepare for transportation."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","You, too, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Request denied.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",I know what the chances are.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Spock, don't argue."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Get back
with the information."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",I'll be right there.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Scotty, energise
transporter."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Bones, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","since you are playing this tape, we
will assume that I am dead, that the tactical situation is critical,
and both of you are locked in mortal combat."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","It means, Spock, that you
have control of the ship and are probably making the most difficult
decisions of your career."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","I can offer only one small piece of advice,
for whatever it's worth."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Use every scrap of knowledge and logic you
have to save the ship."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",But temper your judgment with intuitive insight.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","I believe you have those qualities, but if you can't find them in
yourself, seek out McCoy."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Ask his advice.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","And if you find it sound,
take it."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Bones, you've heard what I've just told Spock."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Help him if you
can."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",But remember he is the Captain.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","His decisions must be followed
without question."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","You might find that he is capable of human insight
and human error."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","They are most difficult to defend, but you will find
that he is deserving of the same loyalty and confidence each of you
have given me."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Take care.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Bones.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","I had a whole universe to myself after the
Defiant was thrown out."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",There was absolutely no one else in it.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","I must
say I prefer a crowded universe much better."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","How did you two get along
without me?"
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Good.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",No problems between you?
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Try me.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Which humans, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Ah, yes."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",I understand.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Well, I hope my last orders were helpful
in solving any problems that you don't feel worth reporting."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",My last orders.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",The last orders that I left for both of you.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","The
last taped orders."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Good.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web",Good.
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Well, I hope we won't have similar opportunities to
test those orders which you never heard."
KIRK,"The
Tholian Web","Ahead warp factor two, Mister
Sulu."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Captain.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",We're losing power in the warp engines.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","We can barely read it, but I don't like the looks of it."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","And I
cannot find out the cause."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Scott here, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Aye, aye, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Aye, aye, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Standing by.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Aye, I think you're right."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Keep us within beaming range, but not
too close."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Bridge to transporter room.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","You got that transporter working yet, Mister?"
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Take over, Mister Sulu."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","I'll be in the
transporter room."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Scott here.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","I can't, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","At least, not all at once."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Everything.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","That ship you're in is fading
out, and it's ripping the innards out of this one."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","It's jamming our transporter
frequencies."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","I've only got three of them working, and I'm not sure of
those."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",One of you has got to wait.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Aye.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Anything?
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",That's it.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",I've done all I can.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","There's nothing out there to
grab a hold of and bring in."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","When that ship went, it must have taken
the Captain with it."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Two hours and twelve minutes?
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","That power leak has unbalanced the
ship and she's starting to drift."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",I can't hold her in place that long.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",He had no cause to be angry.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Transporter room here.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",I'm trying.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Captain Kirk is not on his designated co-ordinates,
Mister Spock."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Scott to Bridge!
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","I know you don't like to use the phasers, but you've got to
do something about that ship out there."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Spock, that hit from the Tholians has fused our power
supply converters."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",I can't do a thing with the Enterprise now.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","She's bound to drift, maybe right
through that doorway out there."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",I don't even know if she can be repaired.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Attention.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",(a respectful pause) Dismissed.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Spock, we have a readout on the Tholian tractor
field."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",I think we can estimate its approximate completion time.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Scott to Captain.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Scott to Captain.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","One of our crewmen just went berserk, but we
have him under control for the moment."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",We're beginning to interphase.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Scott to Bridge.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Are we slipping into interspace?
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",I don't believe it.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Mister Spock.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",I've just seen Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","He was standing
there as plain as we are."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",And then he just disappeared.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Spock, look!"
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Then your fears about that phaser were
correct."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","It blasted a hole right through that crazy space fabric, and
only heaven knows where it sent the Defiant."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",That'll be about twenty minutes.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Aye,
she'll be back together."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","But we'll only have about eighty percent power
built up."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",What have you got there?
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",What is it?
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Aye.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","And deadly, too."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","What are you thinking of, Doc?"
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Are you
trying to kill us all?"
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Oh, well, any decent brand of Scotch will do that."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Does it make a good mix with Scotch?
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",I'll let you know.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","(leaves with the remaining contents of the
flask)"
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Scott here.
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Tholian Web",Standing by.

Tholian Web",Visual detection of an object dead ahead.
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web",Has there ever been a mutiny on a starship before?
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web",Captain.
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web",Just like what I found in life support.
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web",All dead.
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web",It's gone.
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web",The Defiant just vanished.
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web","I don't understand what's so special about this region of
space."
CHEKOV,"The

CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web","Thank you, Mister Spock."
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web","Two minutes, sir."
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web","Yes, sir."
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web",The ship can drive into interspace at any time.
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web",Interphase in ten seconds.
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web","Nine, eight"
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web","Seven, six, five"
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web","Four, three"
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web",One.
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web",There he is!
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web",We're being pulled out of here.
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web","Captain, we have destroyed the Tholians' web."
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web","At once, sir."
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web","The ship has been thrown exactly two point seven two parsecs
distant from our previous position."
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Spock, it's him!"
CHEKOV,"The
Tholian Web",It's the Captain!
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Just within transporter range, sir."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","I can't get an accurate fix on the Defiant, Mister Scott, but I
know it's drifting away from us."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Shall I correct for range, sir?"
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Scott, the Defiant."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web",It's starting to disappear.
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web",I think he had several spasms of pain.
SULU,"The
Tholian Web",Mister Spock.
SULU,"The
Tholian Web",A vessel approaching on an intercept vector.
SULU,"The
Tholian Web",Range two hundred thousand kilometres.
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Velocity zero point five
one C."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","They've stopped dead, sir."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Range ninety thousand kilometres and
holding."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Sensor readings are not corresponding to those we received the
last time we saw the Defiant."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Spock, we're being fired upon."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","But sir, that'll reduce our phaser power by fifty percent."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Phasers locked in, sir."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Ready, Mister Spock."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","A hit, Mister Spock."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Spock, something has just entered sensor range."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","It's
another Tholian, sir."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Loskene must've contacted them when he tried to
intercept us."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Shall I lock in remaining phaser power, sir?"
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Just beyond phaser range, sir."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Yes, sir."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Spock, they're closing the web."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web",It's the Captain.
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Sir, the tractor field is activating."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","I can't, sir."
SULU,"The
Tholian Web","Warp factor two, sir."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","I've been trying to raise them, sir."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",There is no response.
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",Mister Spock?
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","We will be able to retrieve the Captain at that
time, won't we?"
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",I see.
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Doctor, he seemed more angry than frightened."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",Red Alert.
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","All decks, go to Red Alert."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",Mister Spock?
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",I'm receiving a visual signal.
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Spock, damage control report."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Minor structural damage to
sections A4 and C13."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",Mister Spock!
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","There's no response on any frequency, sir."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",They're refusing reception.
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",I can't
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",What is that?
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",Captain!
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Captain Kirk, we thought you were"
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",Spock!
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",Mister.
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Oh, Doctor I've just seen the
Captain."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",He's alive.
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","He's alive, Doctor."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Believe me, I did see him."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",I did.
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",Spock!
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",Mister Spock!
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",Doctor.
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Doctor, I'm not going mad."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",I did see Captain Kirk.
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","I've
got to get to Mister Spock."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Spock didn't believe me either, did he, Doctor?"
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Then I didn't really see him, did I?"
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Will I become like Chekov, Doctor?"
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Am I all right, Doctor?"
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",Then what I saw
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",Captain Kirk's alive?
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Thank you, sir."
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",I see him.
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web","Where are we now, Mister Spock?"
UHURA,"The
Tholian Web",Have we lost the Captain?
O'NEIL,"The
Tholian Web","Locked in on the Defiant Bridge, sir."
O'NEIL,"The
Tholian Web","Transporter room, O'Neil here."
O'NEIL,"The
Tholian Web","No, sir."
O'NEIL,"The
Tholian Web",Not yet.
O'NEIL,"The
Tholian Web",I'm all right.
O'NEIL,"The
Tholian Web","Ready, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Jim.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",The Captain's neck is broken.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",McCoy here.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",I'd say these people killed each other.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","You heard correctly, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","These people
killed each other."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","According to the ship's log, the medical surgeon down here
didn't even know what was going on."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","The best I can do is get all the readings I
can get and analyse them later."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",What the devil?
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Jim, this ship is dissolving."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","My hand just
passed through a man"
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",And a table.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","What happened, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Did anyone notice anything peculiar in his behaviour before
this?"
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Did he seem to be getting hysterical?
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Take Mister Chekov to Sickbay.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Put him under restraint.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",That's what I was afraid of.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Whatever it was that drove the crew
of the Defiant to murder each other could be communicable."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Time.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","By the way, Mister Spock, I think it might be a wise
precaution to put some distance between us and the Defiant."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",How long will that take?
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Spock, are you sure that Jim is still alive?"
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","If we could only find the proper filtering agent, we might be
able to solve this problem."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Negative.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",It's the third failure.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Nurse, take this sample and run an analysis on it."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Thank you, nurse."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Call security.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","I want to have some checks run
on this man."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",McCoy to Bridge.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Has the Captain been beamed aboard yet?
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",When is that interphase going to happen?
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",I thought you had the thing timed out.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","You mean you don't know whether you're going
to be able to recover the Captain or not?"
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",You can't wait for the next one.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","We've had
another case like Chekov."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",I had to confine my orderly to sickbay.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","The disease is not transmitted by the men,
Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",The cause is the area of space we're in.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","It's affecting
the whole crew."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","The molecular structure of the brain
tissues in the central nervous system are distorting."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","And the madness that affected the Defiant's
crew will soon happen to the Enterprise."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Now you've got to get this ship out of
here."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","What's the use of this battle, Spock?"
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",You've lost Jim.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Take this
ship out of here."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Are you satisfied?
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Spock, why did you do it?"
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","You should've known what could've happened and done everything
in your power to safeguard your crew."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","That is the mark of a starship
Captain, like Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","It's still negative, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Theragen is the most
promising substance tested so far."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",We're progressing.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",My staff is working around the clock.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","My being there will not
affect the biochemistry of any of the tests."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","This service requires my
personal attention, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Take him to Sickbay.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Put him in restraint.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","There is a duty to be performed in the Captain's quarters, which
requires our presence."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",The Captain left a message tape.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","It was his order that it be
reviewed by both of us, should he ever be declared dead."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","You have just
declared Jim dead."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Why?
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Are you afraid it'll change your present status?
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","The Captain's last order is top priority, and you will honour
that order before you take over."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","(looking at a medal) He was a hero in every
sense of the word, yet his life was sacrificed for nothing."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","The one
thing that would have given his death meaning is the safety of the
Enterprise."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Now you've made that impossible, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Maybe not the same one.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","I really came here to find out why you
stayed and fought."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Yes, he would, Mister Spock, but you didn't have that decision
to make."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",What would you gain by fighting the Tholians?
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","You could have
assured yourself of a captaincy by leaving the area."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","But you chose to
stay."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Why?
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",You mean to be sure if he was dead.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Well, you made certain of
that."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Yes, I have something to do."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","If this crew is to survive, I have
to find an antidote to this space you've locked us into."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","There's no hurry, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","The antidote probably doesn't
concern you."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Vulcans are probably immune, so just take your time."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","I must admit I don't understand you, Spock, but I just can't
believe that you would want Jim's command."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","You must know that if you get us out of this situation, they'll pin a
medal on your chest and give you command of the Enterprise."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",I would like to remedy that situation.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Spock, I, er, I'm sorry."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","It does hurt, doesn't it?"
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Of course you have, Uhura."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",We would all like to
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Of course.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",We're going to Sickbay.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Yes, Nurse."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Yes, it's beginning to spread generally throughout the ship."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","No, except I'm positive that it's a theragen derivative that's
the answer."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",And it better be the next one.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Well, nobody saw him but you, Uhura."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",I don't think so.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","No, no."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",We're working hard.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",We'll find an antidote.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Sounds like a horror story.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Suppose there's any truth in it?
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Do you suppose they're seeing Jim because they've lost
confidence in you?"
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",It's getting critical.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","There have been a number of assaults down
on the lower decks."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Even Scotty's being affected.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","If Scotty goes under,
that's the finish of whatever chance we have of getting the Enterprise
out of here."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Spock!
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",It must be this space.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",It's getting to me too.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","I know
it's nothing you've done, Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","I, I'm sorry."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Yes, Uhura, you're fine."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",It was real.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",We all saw him.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",The Captain's still alive.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",McCoy here.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",I'll be right there.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",Compliments of the house.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","To your good health and the health of
the crew."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Yes, and I've ordered it orally or intravenously for everyone
aboard the ship."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",I would like for you gentlemen to drink it down.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",He's his smiling self again.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",I've discharged him from Sickbay.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",It's a diluted theragen derivative.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","That's right, and in this derivative, mixed with alcohol, it
merely deadens certain nerve inputs to the brain."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","One good slug of this, and you can hit a man with phaser stun,
and he'd never feel it or even know it."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",It should.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Well, drink it down, Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",It's the human thing to do.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","That's a
medical order, Captain."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web",McCoy here.
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","I'm ready, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Welcome home, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Oh, we managed."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Mister Spock gave the orders, and I found the
answers."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","He means when humans become involved with Vulcans, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","What orders are you referring to, Jim?"
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Oh, those orders."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","Well, there wasn't time."
MCCOY,"The
Tholian Web","We never had a chance
to listen to them."
COMPUTER,"The
Tholian Web",Computer working.
COMPUTER,"The
Tholian Web",Next interphase two hours twelve minutes.
LOSKENE,"The
Tholian Web",I am Commander Loskene.
LOSKENE,"The
Tholian Web","You are trespassing in
a territorial annex of the Tholian Assembly."
LOSKENE,"The
Tholian Web","You must leave this area
immediately."
LOSKENE,"The
Tholian Web","We claim this territory and are prepared to
use force, if necessary, to protect our property."
LOSKENE,"The
Tholian Web",I find no evidence of a disabled ship.
LOSKENE,"The
Tholian Web","My
instruments indicate ours are the only two vessels in this area."
LOSKENE,"The
Tholian Web","Very well, Enterprise."
LOSKENE,"The
Tholian Web","In the interest of
interstellar amity, we will wait precisely one hour and fifty
three minutes."
LOSKENE,"The
Tholian Web",But be correct.
LOSKENE,"The
Tholian Web",We do not tolerate deceit.
CHAPEL,"The
Tholian Web","Yes, Doctor."
CHAPEL,"The
Tholian Web",Doctor McCoy!
CHAPEL,"The
Tholian Web","Doctor McCoy,"
CHAPEL,"The
Tholian Web","I have the diagnosis of the crewman who attacked engineer
Scott."
CHAPEL,"The
Tholian Web","It was definitely due to the deteriorative effects of
interspace."
CHAPEL,"The
Tholian Web","Are we any closer, Doctor?"
CHAPEL,"The
Tholian Web",Nurse Chapel to Doctor McCoy.
CHAPEL,"The
Tholian Web","Results of the last theragen test are ready for you, Doctor."

SPOCK,"For

SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Yes, Captain?"
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Correct, Captain."
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",We are approaching those co-ordinates.
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","An asteroid, two hundred miles in diameter."
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",We've had that area on scanners constantly.
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Correct, Captain."
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Typical asteroid chemically, but it is not orbiting."
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","It is
pursing an independent course through this solar system."

SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Then the passengers, or builders, are dead."
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Interesting.
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","The course Ensign Chekov just gave for the asteroid would put it
on a collision course with Daran Five."
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Correct.
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Population approximately three billion and seven
hundred twenty four million, if memory serves me correctly."

time of impact three hundred ninety six days."
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",One fails to see the logic in making a ship look like a planet.
SPOCK,"For

shock."

that has happened here."

SPOCK,"For

SPOCK,"For

SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","The Captain and I seem to have suffered no
ill effects."
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Captain, informing these people they're on a ship may be in
violation of the Prime Directive of Starfleet Command."
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Logical, Captain."
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Also logical, Captain."
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",He said it was forbidden to climb the mountains.
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Indeed, Doctor."
SPOCK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","The young lady did show a marked preference for
your company."

these people do, to protect themselves."

conduct was initiated when Natira knelt on that platform."

system."

ten thousand years."
SPOCK,"For

KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Missile spread, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Anything on communications, Lieutenant Uhura?"
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Course of the missile, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Prepare phaser banks one and two, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Mister Chekov, get a fix on the missile's point of origin."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Fire phasers.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","(the missiles are obliterated) Mister Chekov, alter
course to the missile's point of origin."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Warp factor three, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",What's the emergency?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",That was quite a scene.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Excellent.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",What's the emergency?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Serious?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",What is it?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Who?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Who is it?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Confirm Chekov's co-ordinates for the missile's point of origin.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",That object on the screen?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Could the enemy vessel be hiding behind the asteroid?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Then the asteroid is the missile's point of origin.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Full sensor probe, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",How could that be?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Unless it's powered.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",A spaceship?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Source of power?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Mister Chekov, plot the course of the asteroid vessel."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Yes?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Daran Five?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Inhabited?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Mister Sulu, match Enterprise speed with that of the asteroid
vessel."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Mister Spock and I are transporting aboard.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Mister Scott, you
have the conn."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and I will handle this."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Well, I think it would be wiser if"
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","All right, Doctor."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",If that's what you want.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Wouldn't know this was a spaceship.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Transported without incident.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Kirk out.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",No apparent opening.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Of a sort.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Weapons, communication devices."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Let me go to my
friend."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You all right?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",I can't say I think much of your welcome.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",They've been in flight ten thousand years.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Maybe they don't
realise it."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",I am Captain Kirk of the starship Enterprise.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","This is my medical
officer, Doctor McCoy."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","My first officer, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",We've come in friendship.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Spock.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",(he wakes) Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Bones.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Bones?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","No, that's not it."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","You're right, Spock."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","The shock was serious because of McCoy's
weakened condition."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I don't think he would've told you himself, but I think you
should know now."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",It's xenopolycythemia.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Then you know that nothing can be done.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Bones, how is it?"
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Spock knows.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Are you in any condition to get up?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",No.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","The people of Yonada may be changed by the knowledge, but
it's better than exterminating them."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",And the three billion on Daran Five.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","No, we're from outside your world."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Up there.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Outside, up there, everywhere."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Why is it forbidden?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","What is it, Bones?"
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","For the world is hollow, and I have touched the sky."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Yes, of course it is, because if you did you'd touch the sky and
find out that you were living on a big ball."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Not a planet, but a
spaceship."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",And that knowledge seems to be forbidden.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",We don't know.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",He just suddenly screamed in pain and died.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You seem to be the special favourite.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Personally, I find the lady's taste questionable, but she
obviously prefers you, and you obviously don't seem to mind."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","If you
could arrange to be alone with the young lady, Spock and I would be
left alone to find the power controls of this world."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Thank you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",To our good friends of Yonada.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Good.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Then you wouldn't mind if we looked around?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Thank you.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",And thank you for taking care of Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I wonder how many generations have lived out their lives and been
buried here without ever knowing that their world is hollow."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","The problem, to get in."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Fabrini?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Didn't the Fabrini sun go nova and destroy its planets?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Some of them must have been put aboard this ship and sent to
another planet."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",And these are their descendants.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","(Once the coast is
clear.)"
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Now.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",The Oracle doesn't seem to know we're here.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I
wonder what alerted it the first time."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",I think you're right.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Continue investigating.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","The clue to the
location of the control room must be around here somewhere."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",This plaque is a representation of a star and its solar system.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Then there's no doubt these people are the descendants of the
Fabrini."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You're returning with us?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Bones, this isn't a planet."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","It's a space ship on a collision
course with Daran Five."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Doctor McCoy, I order you to return with us."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Bones, if we can't correct the course of this ship, we'll have to
blast it out of space."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",As her husband?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",We're beaming over.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Lock in on our signal.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",And transport Mister Spock and myself immediately.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","He's staying, Scotty."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Kirk out.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","That is the problem, sir."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Yes.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Those are the orders.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Kirk here.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Put him on.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Yes, Bones."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You've located the controls?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Where is it?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Bones, are you all right?"
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Bones, answer me!"
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Bones, what is it?"
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",(Natira runs in.)
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Bones, what is it?"
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","McCoy, what's happening?"
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","What's
happening, McCoy?"
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Help him.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Spock, take care of McCoy."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",We have freed him from the cruelty of your Oracle.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Bones.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Bones.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You said something about a book.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Where is it?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Now listen to me.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You must listen to what I have to say.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Give me
one moment to speak to you."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",One moment.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Natira, if you don't believe
what I'm about to tell you, you can call the guards."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","We'll accept any
punishment you decree."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You must believe that what I'm about to tell you is the truth.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Yes, my world and your world of Yonada."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",I understand.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I understand, Natira."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Ten thousand years ago, a sun
was dying and with it, its world."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","It's the world you see on the plaque
in the room of the Oracle."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",No.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","It is the world of your ancestors, your creators."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","It no
longer exists."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","No, I'm not."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Now listen to me!
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Hear me out.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","When your ancestors
discovered that their world was dying they built a great ship and chose
their best people."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",They wished for their race to survive.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","They sent the
ship out into space."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Yes.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",No.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You are living inside a hollow ball.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Your ancestors created
it to take you on a journey to a promised new planet."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Because a flaw developed in the controls.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","And unless we correct
it, Yonada will kill millions of people and destroy a world it doesn't
even know."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Let us remove the instrument of obedience, the way we did for
McCoy."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Natira.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Do you think she understood me?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Is she all right?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",We do this for the survival of the people of Yonada.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",We mean no desecration to the faith of Yonada.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","We must consult
the book to help you."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","McCoy, how do you open this thing?"
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Here.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",The plan must be in there.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Is it indexed?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Hurry, Spock."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Let's get her out of the heat.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Active and functional.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Not too different from
the Enterprise."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Enough to turn it off course?
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Good.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Going back to marked headings.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Steadying on course marked in red.
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Doctor McCoy, the Fabrini descendants are scheduled to debark on
their promised planet in approximately three hundred and ninety days."
KIRK,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I think that we could manage to be in that vicinity at that time, if
you wanted to thank the Fabrini personally."
SCOTT,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Aye, and chemically fuelled to boot, sir."
SCOTT,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Then it must be on automatic controls.
SCOTT,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Enterprise.
SCOTT,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Scott here.
SCOTT,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Scott here, Captain."
SCOTT,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","But, Captain, what about Doctor McCoy?"
UHURA,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","No, sir."
UHURA,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",All bands clear.
UHURA,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Captain Kirk.
UHURA,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Bridge to Captain Kirk.
UHURA,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","An urgent call from Doctor McCoy, sir."
CHEKOV,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Aye, Captain."
CHEKOV,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Course of asteroid, I mean spaceship two four one mark one
seven."
CHAPEL,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I am a nurse first, Doctor McCoy, and a
member of the crew of the Enterprise second."
CHAPEL,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","No, I'm sorry, Doctor."
CHAPEL,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I've called the Captain and I'll wait
until he comes."
CHAPEL,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",A lot can happen in a year.
CHAPEL,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Please, give
yourself every minute."
CHAPEL,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Excellent, Doctor."
CHAPEL,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",The white corpuscle count is back to normal.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You're excused.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You may return to your quarters.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I said you were excused, Nurse."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Please, Christine."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I promise you
I'll give the Captain a full report."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I've just completed the standard physical examinations for the
entire crew."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",The crew is fit.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I found nothing unusual, with one exception."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Terminal.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Xenopolycythemia.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",It has no cure.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",He has one year to live.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",The ship's Chief Medical Officer.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I'll be most effective on the job in the time left, if you'll
keep this to yourself."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Without me, Jim?"
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You'd never find your way back.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",I'd like to go.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I'm fine, Captain."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You'd swear you were on the surface of a planet.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","You found no intelligent life forms, Mister Spock, but surely"
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",I think so.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",She called this the world.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","These people don't know they're on a
spaceship."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",I'm all right.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Are you all right, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Oh, that Oracle really got to me."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I must be especially
susceptible to its magic spells."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Well, we'd better get to the control room."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Don't worry.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I can make it, Jim."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Gentlemen, I believe we have a visitor."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",It tastes like an ancient herb derivative.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",There's something under the skin.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","(a red light goes out) He's
dead."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Oh, no."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I'm quite all right, thank you."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Well, now."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Nobody can blame her for that, can they?"
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Perhaps not.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You are very kind.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","No, thank you."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",I'm curious.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",How did the Oracle punish the old man?
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","There is some way the Oracle knows what you say, isn't there?"
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",It's all right.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I suppose we had to learn the power of the
Oracle."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Honesty is usually wise.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","No, there isn't."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Oh, yes."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Yes, I do."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",We do.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",But we're strangers to each other.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Yes.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",How long will it take you to reach this new world?
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","If you only knew how I needed some kind of future, Natira."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Yes, very lonely."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",There's something I need to tell you.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",But there is.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",I have an illness for which there is no cure.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I have one year to
live."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",What are you going to do to my friends?
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",And the punishment is death?
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","They acted out of ignorance, Natira."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",Please let them return to the ship.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",For me?
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",I've made my decision.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I'm staying here, on Yonada."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Natira, what they did, they did because they felt they had to."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","Please,
let them return to the ship."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky",You won't regret it.
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","How do you think I'd
feel if I stayed here with the chance to be happy for the first time in
my life, but knowing my friends had died?"
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","No, I'm not."
MCCOY,"For
The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky","I'm on a kind of a collision course myself, Jim."

my world?"

keep us in darkness?"
NATIRA,"For

Day Of The Dove",Sulu?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Override.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Scotty, stop all engines."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Scotty!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",New course?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",That'll take us out of the galaxy.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Johnson.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Get down to Security.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Search every section.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Some
Klingons may have beamed aboard undetected from the wrecked ship."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Then
get down to Engineering and help Scotty hammer things back to normal."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",And free those trapped crewmen.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","(to Kang) And before I put you in the
brig, there's a little something I owe you."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Phasers.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Out!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Sickbay.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Bridge.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",The Klingons are free.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","They're armed as we
are."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",They'll try to take the ship.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Scotty, how many men do we have?"
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Deploy forces to protect your section and the auxiliary control
centre."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Check the armoury, and try and free
those trapped crewmen."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Blow out the bulkheads if you have to.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We
need numbers."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","What kind of luck have you had controlling the ship's
speed?"
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Five-minute report.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Kirk out.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Full sensor scan of the ship.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Report on any
movement by the Klingons."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","The Klingon Empire has maintained a duelling
tradition."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",They think they can beat us with swords.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Any other logical candidate?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Mister Sulu.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Get below.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Take command of Engineering and auxiliary
control."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Mister Chekov.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Mister Chekov, as you were."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Chekov!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",This is no time for a vendetta.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Maintain your post.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Chekov, maintain your post!"
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","His only brother, killed in a Klingon raid."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Sulu, get down to Engineering."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Security, this is the captain."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Find Mister Chekov and bring him
to the bridge."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","I don't know, but he does."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","And now he wants revenge for a
non-existent loss."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",What about the armoury?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Get back to Engineering.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Try to re-establish
engine control, and talk to ordnance about manufacturing phaser
replacements."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",What the blazes is going on?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Constant surveillance, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Could more Klingons have beamed aboard?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",An alien life force.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We must make contact, find out what it
wants."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","A brother that never existed, a phantom colony, imaginary
distress calls, the creation of these weapons."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Do you sense a pattern,
Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","And now it has control of the Enterprise and taking us out of the
galaxy."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",But why?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We must talk to Kang, bury the hatchet."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",McCoy?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",The alien is the real threat.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","That's the enemy we have to wipe
out."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Kirk here.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Kang, there's something important I must
discuss with you."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","(dictating into PADD) The Enterprise is heading out of our
galaxy, controlled by a mysterious alien somewhere aboard the ship."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Engineering has been taken over by Klingons who have cut off
life-support systems."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Mister Sulu.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Get down to emergency manual control.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Try to protect our
life-support circuits and auxiliary power."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Scotty, I'm glad you've come."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Scotty?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Scotty, take it easy."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Gentlemen!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",(intervenes as they nearly come to blows.)
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Spock!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Scotty.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Spock.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Spock!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Stop it!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",You're half human!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",What are we saying?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",What are we doing to each other?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",We've been under stress before.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","It's never set us at each other's
throats."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",There isn't any war!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Or is there?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Scotty.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",What's happening to us?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We've been trained to think in
other terms than war."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We've been trained to fight its causes, if
necessary."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Then why are we behaving like a group of savages?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Look at
me."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Look at me.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Two forces aboard this ship, each of them equally
armed."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Has a war been staged for us, complete with weapons and ideology
and patriotic drum beating?"
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Even, Spock, even race hatred?"
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",But what's the game?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",And whose?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",And what are the rules?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Yes.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Mister Sulu, report."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",We're getting something.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Good work.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Start scanning.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Let's find that alien.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Let's go.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Chekov!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",What have I done?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","(to Mara) There's an alien entity aboard the
ship."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",It's forcing us to fight.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",We don't want to.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We don't know what
its motive is."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",We're trying to find out.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",You must help us.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Take me to
Kang."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","A temporary truce, that's all I ask."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Spock, take her."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Chekov.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Chekov.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","(picks him up) Is this what's in store for us,
from here on in?"
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Violence, hatred."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",He lost control.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",So did I.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",We're becoming animal warriors.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Let's
go, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Why?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","So we can fight, and fight, and keep coming back for more
like some bloody coliseum?"
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","What's next, the roar of crowds?"
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Let's find the alien.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",(to Mara) You come with us.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Maybe we can
prove to you that it exists."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",What is it?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",What do you want?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",What are you doing here?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Duty?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Did McCoy release you from Sickbay?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Then get back to Sickbay!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",I order you
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Johnson!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",It subsists on the emotions of others.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",It exists on the hate of others.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","And kept numbers and resources balanced, so that it can maintain
a constant state of violence."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",It's got to have a vulnerable area.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We've
got to get rid of it."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Or we're a doomed ship, travelling forever between galaxies,
filled with eternal bloodlust, eternal warfare."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Kang has got to listen.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",We've got to pool our knowledge and get rid of this thing.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","(goes to
intercom) Kang."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Kang, this is Captain Kirk."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Kang, do you read me?"
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Kang.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",(switches off intercom) He won't answer.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Time factor?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Well, do whatever you can."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Kirk out.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","And so we drift in space, with only hatred and bloodshed aboard."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Now do you believe?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","If I could talk to Kang, somehow cut through the Klingon lines,
make peace before it's too late."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Kang!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Kang, this is Captain Kirk."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","I know you can hear me, so don't cut me
off."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We have Mara, your wife."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We talk truce now, or she dies."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Reply.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",She has five seconds to live.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Reply.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",He called my bluff.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",The Federation doesn't kill or mistreat its prisoners.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","You've
been listening to propaganda, fables."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",How much time?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",We only wanted to stop the fighting to save us all.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",There's another way to survive.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Mutual trust and help.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",How?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We can't get through the Klingon defences in time, unless."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Spock.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Intra-ship beaming from one section to another.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",It's possible?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",We're all in a trap.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",This is the only way out.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",No.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",That'd start the final battle.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",I believe her.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Prepare the
transporter."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",We'll wait for your signal.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","I hope your computations are correct, Mister
Spock."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Mara.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Before you start killing, give me one minute."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Nobody wins.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Have any more of your men died?
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",We can't be killed.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",There's an alien aboard.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",It wants us alive.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Look!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Look, Kang."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",For the rest of our lives.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","A thousand
lifetimes."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Senseless violence, fighting, while an alien has total
control over us."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",All right.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",All right.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",In the heart.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",In the head.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","I won't stay
dead."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Next time I'll do the same to you.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",I'll kill you.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","And it goes on,
the good old game of war, pawn against pawn!"
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Stopping the bad guys.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","While somewhere, something sits back and laughs and starts it all over
again."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Be a pawn, be a toy, be a good soldier that never questions
orders."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Lieutenant Uhura.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Put me on ship-wide intercom.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Kang.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",This is Captain Kirk.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",A truce is ordered.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",The fighting is over.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Lay down your weapons.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Get off my ship.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",You're a dead duck here.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",You're powerless.
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We
know about you, and we don't want to play."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Maybe there are others like
you around."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of history,
but that's all over."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We'll be on guard now, ready for you."
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",So ship out!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Come on!
KIRK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Haul it!
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Full scan.
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Results negative.
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Radiation level normal.
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","Atmosphere
and terrain are undisturbed."
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","No evidence of a colony nor any residual
aftereffect of a force that might have annihilated it."
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Which we were unable to detect upon approach.
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Cossacks!
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Filthy Klingon murderers!
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","You killed my brother
Piotre."
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",The Archanis Four research outpost.
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","A hundred peaceful people
massacred!"
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Just like you did here.
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","My brother, you killed my brother."
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","Captain, you can't."
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Don't let these animals have the ship.
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","Captain, leave them where they are."
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Non-existence.
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","That's so
many less Klingon monsters in the galaxy."
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",We know what happened.
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",That distress call.
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Lies.
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","They want to start a war by
pretending that we did."
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Captain.
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",(he has a sword too)
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Captain!
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",(gets up to go with Sulu)
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","Sir, let me go too."
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","I've got a personal score to settle with
the Klingons."
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Captain!
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","Don't try to stop me, Captain."
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","I saw what they left of Piotre,
and I swore on his grave I would avenge his murder."
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",You don't die yet.
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove","You're not human, but you're very beautiful."
CHEKOV,"The
Day Of The Dove",Very beautiful.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",Nothing.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","They said they were being attacked by an unidentified
ship."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","Jim, you can't hand over the Enterprise."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",Move aside.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",(he tends to Chekov)
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",What happened?
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",Chekov may be right.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","The Klingons claim to have honoured the
truce, but there have been incidents, raids on our outposts."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",What proof do we need?
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",We know what a Klingon is.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",There.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",Those filthy butchers.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","There are rules, even in war."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","You
don't keep hacking at a man after he's down."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","Hand me that numanol
capsule."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",Truce?
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",Are you serious?
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","I've got men in Sickbay, some of them
dying."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","Atrocities committed on their persons, and you talk about making
peace with these fiends?"
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","If our backs were turned, they'd jump us in a
minute."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",And you know what Klingons do to prisoners.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","Slave labour, death
planets, experiments!"
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","While you're talking, they're planning attacks."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","This is a fight
to the death."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",We'd better start trying to win it!
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","Who cares what started it, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",We're in it!
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",Murderers.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",We should wipe out every one of them!
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","How many more men must die before you two begin to act like
military men instead of fools?"
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",(leaves)
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",Brain waves show almost paranoid mania.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",What happened?
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",Orderly.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",Jim.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",Johnson's heart wound is almost healed.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","Same with
the other casualties."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","Sword wounds in the vital organs, massive trauma,
shock."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",They're all healing at a fantastic rate.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","Gentlemen, if we are pawns, you're looking at one who is
extremely sorry."
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove",Let's jump him.
MCCOY,"The
Day Of The Dove","Yeah, out already."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Sensors have picked up a Klingon ship,
closing fast."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Captain, the enemy ship is drifting, totally disabled."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",And we never fired upon her.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Here, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Understood, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Transporter room.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Our landing party is intact, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","First group from the Klingon vessel, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","At the moment we received the distress signal from the colony on
Beta Twelve A, the Klingons were too far distant to have been the
attackers."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Moreover, they also were apparently attracted by a distress
call."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Our log tapes will indicate our innocence in the present
situation."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Sensor sweeps reveal no other ships within range, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Captain, neither the Klingon technology nor ours, is capable of
this."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",The instantaneous transmutation of matter.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","I doubt that they are
responsible."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",None.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","However, if they had such power, would they not have used
it to create more effective weapons and only for themselves?"
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Scans indicate that our forces and those of the Klingons are
exactly equal at thirty eight each."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","The Klingons control deck six and
starboard deck seven, while we control all sections above."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Most curious, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","There appear to be more life-energy units
on board than can be accounted for by the presence of the Enterprise
crew plus the Klingons."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",A considerable discrepancy.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",I shall attempt a compensatory reading of Klingon units.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","No additional Klingons detected, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","It
is an alien life force, a single entity."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","I cannot ascertain its
location."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Readings being diverted to the library computer for analysis.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Computer report.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",What purpose?
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","If the alien is creating these events, Captain, it is apparently
capable of manipulating matter and mind."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Captain, I am constrained to point out that since minds are
evidently being influenced, we cannot know at this moment whether our
own memories are completely accurate and true."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",An appropriate choice of terms.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","However, it is notoriously
difficult to arrange a truce with the Klingons once blood has been
drawn."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We are attempting to end it, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","By reason, preferably."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",There is an alien on board which may have created this situation.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Easy, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","May I say that I have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with
humans?"
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",I find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",The result of stress?
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Recent events would seem to be directed toward a magnification
of the basic hostilities between humans and Klingons."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Apparently, it is
by design that we fight."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",We seem to be pawns.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","It is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately,
and determine its motives and a method for halting its activities."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Sensors may be operating.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Alien detected in the engineering section,
near reactor number three."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Jim, he's not responsible."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",It would appear that the entity wants us alive.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Perhaps human and Klingon psychologies and combat capabilities
are being tested by an alien with designs on both powers."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","I understand, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","I, too, felt a brief surge of racial
bigotry."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Most distasteful.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Totally unfamiliar.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","During Lieutenant Johnson's emotional outburst, his
expression of hatred and lust for vengeance, the alien's life energy
level increased."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","When the Lieutenant became unconscious, the alien lost
energy."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","This one appears to be strengthened by mental irradiations of
hostility, violent intentions."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",To put it simply.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","And it has acted as a catalyst, creating this
situation in order to satisfy that need."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","It has brought together
opposing forces, provided crude instruments in an effort to promote the
most violent mode of conflict."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","The
fighting must end and soon."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","The alien is affecting his mind, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Soon, it will become
so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",There's nothing we can do about it.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","We have nine minutes, fifty three seconds to power zero."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","There is, of course, a logical alternative."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Kang's wife is, after all,
our prisoner."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",Perhaps a threat.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Eight minutes, forty two seconds."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",It has rarely been done because of the danger involved.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Pinpoint
accuracy is required."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","If the transportee should materialise inside a
solid object, a deck or wall."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",No one can guarantee the actions of another.
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Your automatic setting is laid in,
Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","When transporter is energised, you will have
eight seconds to get to the pads."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","You'll know in seven point nine seconds, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Those who hate and fight must stop themselves, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","Otherwise, it is not stopped."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","All fighting must end, Captain, to weaken the alien before our
dilithium crystals are gone."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove","The cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Day Of The Dove",I suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon.
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove",Trouble aboard the Klingon ship.
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove","Evidence of
explosions, massive destruction."
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove","Forward phasers locked and ready to fire, sir."
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove","Warp factor three, sir."
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove",Change in course.
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove",Accelerating.
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove",Helm dead.
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove","Auxiliary navigation
dead."
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove","Nothing responds, Captain."
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove",Nine oh two mark five.
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove","Aye, sir."
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove",What's Chekov's grudge against the Klingons?
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove",Who's Piotre?
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove",His brother?
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove",He never had a brother.
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove",He's an only child.
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove","Aye, sir."
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove","All clear, Mister Scott."
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove",Aye.
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove",Captain.
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove","Aye, Captain."
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove","No good, Captain."
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove","Circuits are in, but systems just aren't
responding."
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove","Aye, Captain."
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove","Power and life-support
restored."
SULU,"The
Day Of The Dove",Remotes on standby.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",You attacked my ship!
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Four hundred of my crew dead.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","Kirk, my ship
is disabled."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",I claim yours.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","You are now prisoners of the Klingon Empire
against which you have committed a wanton act of war!"
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","For three years, the Federation and the Klingon Empire have been
at peace."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",A treaty we have honoured to the letter.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Were the screams of my crew imaginary?
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","What were your orders,
Kirk?"
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",To start a war?
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",You've succeeded.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",To test a new weapon?
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","We shall
be happy to examine it."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",By what?
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","No bodies, no ruins."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",A colony of the invisible?
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",We have wondered when you would begin.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","You lured my ship into
ambush by a false Klingon distress call."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","You will tell us why with the
proper persuasion."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","I don't propose to spend the rest of my life on this ball of dust
arguing your fantasies."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",The Enterprise is mine!
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Instruct your transporter room to beam us aboard.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","We have no devil, Kirk."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",But we understand the habits of yours.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","I
shall torture you to death one by one until your noble captain cries
enough."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Who will be first?
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",And you volunteer to join him.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",That is loyalty.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","Don't plan any tricks, Kirk."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","I will kill one hundred hostages at
the first sign of treachery."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Animals?
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Your captain crawls like one.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","A Klingon would never have
surrendered."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Order everybody in this area to be transported up.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","All
weapons on him."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Liar!
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",There are still survivors aboard my ship.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Completing the job you started?
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","My wife, Mara, and my science officer."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",More Federation treachery.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",We are prisoners.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",So I have seen.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","When I take this ship, I'll have Kirk's head
stuffed and hung on his cabin wall."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","No, they wish to question us, learn our strength, our plans."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","They
never will."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Patience.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Vigilance.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",They will make a mistake.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","Capture of the
Enterprise will give us knowledge to end this war quickly."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Most interesting.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","The bulk of your crew
trapped, your ship racing from this galaxy at wild speeds."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Delightful.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","How did I perform this sabotage, Kirk?"
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",All my men are here.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Then we take the ship.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","In time, in time."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",We must take these sections.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","First,
Engineering."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",This is Kang.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",I have captured your engineering section.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","I now control this
ship's power and life-support systems."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","I have deprived all areas except our
own."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",You will die of suffocation in the icy cold of space.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Cause them to be unsteady.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",One of Kirk's tricks.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Could he bypass this circuit?
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","What power is
it that supports our battle yet starves our victory?"
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Power.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","Interrupt
it at their main life-support couplings."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Where?
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","She is a victim of war, Captain."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",She understands.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","Mara, you're alive, and you bring us a prize."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","Brave captain, what about?"
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","What have they done to you, Mara?"
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Are you out of your mind?
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","What
have they done to you?"
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","(sees the torn tunic) I see why the human beast
did not kill you."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","With your death, we win."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",No doubt you will reassemble after I have hacked you to bits!
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Klingons kill for their own purposes.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",This is Kang.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Cease hostilities.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Disarm.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Out!
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",We need no urging to hate humans.
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove","But for the present, only
a fool fights in a burning house."
KANG,"The
Day Of The Dove",Out!
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",All others suspended in transit.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Who are the guests, by the way?"
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Well, they're right in here."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Captain, we've not been able to get through to Starfleet
Command."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","All subspace frequencies have been blocked, and there's too
much radiation coming from that Klingon ship."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","It's a hazard to the
vicinity."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",Transporter room to Bridge.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Klingon ship is vacated, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","I would if I could, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",The controls have gone crazy.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Something's
taken over."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","The engines, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","They've gone to warp nine, by themselves!"
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",Three hundred and ninety two trapped below decks.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",The doors and bulkheads won't budge.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",We'll have to cut through.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","No, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",She's a projectile at warp nine.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",And don't ask me what's holding her together.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Scott here, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","There's no use trying to free those men down
below."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","The phaser torches, they won't cut through the bulkheads, nor
the doors, nor the decks."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",There's something happened to the metal.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","I'm there now, sir, and you never saw such a fine collection of
antiques in your life."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","(spots a special sword amongst the
ordinary ones.)"
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",A Claymore.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",You're a beauty.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Any signs of those devils, Mister Sulu?"
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",They've taken Engineering.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","I don't know how
many more of those Klingons are around, but we'll split up here and try
to make it back to the bridge."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",Sir.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Chekov was right, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",We should have left those fuzz-faced goons in the transporter.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",That's right where they belong!
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",Non-existence!
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Now they can study the Enterprise, add our
technology to theirs, change the balance of power."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","You've jeopardised
the Federation!"
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",Keep your Vulcan hands off me.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",Just keep away!
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Your feelings
might be hurt, you green-blooded half-breed!"
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Then transfer out, freak!"
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",But this is war.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",Have we forgotten how to defend ourselves?
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",Without sensors?
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",All our power down?
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","This thing could go
anywhere."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","But, Captain, I didn't do it."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",Everything just came on by itself.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Scotty, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","The ship's dilithium crystals are
deteriorating."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",We can't stop the process.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","In twelve minutes, we'll be totally without engine power."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","There's no change, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","The dilithium
crystals are discharging."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",Aye.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",Now that's something the Klingons would understand.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",It's the alien that's done this.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","We're in its power, our people
and yours."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","I wouldn't trust her, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","Even if it could work, she may be leading you into a trap."
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove",We'll go with you.
SCOTT,"The
Day Of The Dove","But she can't guarantee that Kang will stop to listen, right,
Mister Spock?"
JOHNSON,"The
Day Of The Dove","Security on the way, sir."
JOHNSON,"The
Day Of The Dove",Move 'em out.
JOHNSON,"The
Day Of The Dove",Move!
JOHNSON,"The
Day Of The Dove","Reporting for duty, sir."
JOHNSON,"The
Day Of The Dove",I released myself.
JOHNSON,"The
Day Of The Dove","Not on your life, sir."
JOHNSON,"The
Day Of The Dove",I'm fit and ready for action.
JOHNSON,"The
Day Of The Dove","The
Klingons almost did me in once."
JOHNSON,"The
Day Of The Dove",I'm out to even the score.
JOHNSON,"The
Day Of The Dove",I've got my orders.
JOHNSON,"The
Day Of The Dove",I'm obeying orders!
JOHNSON,"The
Day Of The Dove",Kill the Klingons!
JOHNSON,"The
Day Of The Dove","It's them or us, isn't it?"
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Kang, what has happened?"
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",What will they do to us?
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove","I've heard of their atrocities, their
death camps."
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove","They will torture us for our scientific and military
information."
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",They will kill us before we can act.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",We are forty against four hundred.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",Enemy numbers are the same as ours.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",We have a fighting balance.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",Their life-support systems have resumed.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",Holding steady.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",They appear to be controlled from another location.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Also unable
to affect ship's course for return to our empire."
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",Number six deck.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",(to Klingon) Come.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Commander, it's a trick!"
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",You're not going
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",So this was no trick?
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",We have always fought.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",We must.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove","We are hunters, Captain, tracking
and taking what we need."
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove","There are poor planets in the Klingon systems,
we must push outward if we are to survive."
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",I will help you now.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",I will take you to Kang.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",I will add my voice to yours.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Kang, wait."
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove","He's come alone, unarmed."
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",He must talk to you.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",No!
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",Listen to him.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",We are all in danger.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Kang, don't!"
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",They didn't harm me.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",Listen to him.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",You fool.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Kang, I am your wife."
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",I'm a Klingon.
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",Would I lie for them?
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Listen
to Kirk."
MARA,"The
Day Of The Dove",He is telling the truth.
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Still no contact with Starfleet Command, sir."
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Outside
communications blanketed."
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","No contact with Starfleet as yet, sir."
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove",(losing her temper) Captain!
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove",This doesn't make sense.
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Carriers
are normal."
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove",Channels are open.
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove",There's still no outside contact!
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","I
don't understand it, sir."
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove",Could the Klingons be doing something?
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Captain, reports coming in from the lower decks."
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Emergency
bulkheads have closed."
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Almost four hundred crewmen are trapped down
there, sir."
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Captain, why would, why would Chekov believe he has a brother?"
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Sickbay calling, Doctor."
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","There are more wounded men requiring
your attention."
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Yes, Captain?"
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"The
Day Of The Dove","Ready, Captain."
KLINGON,"The
Day Of The Dove","Four thousand throats may be cut in one night by a running
man."
KLINGON,"The
Day Of The Dove","Layout and specifications of the Enterprise, Commander."
KLINGON,"The
Day Of The Dove",A ship that is headed towards the end of the galaxy?
BALD KLINGON,"The
Day Of The Dove","Stand and fight, you cowards."
ALL,"The
Day Of The Dove",Victory!
ALL,"The
Day Of The Dove",Victory!

ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,(echoy voice and a huge shadow on the wall) Are you from the spaceship Enterprise?
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Alexander, at your service."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"I sing, I dance, I play all variety of games, and I'm a good loser, a very good loser."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Please, sir, try to bear that in mind."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Now, would you please accompany me?"
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Oh, Platonians."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm sure you've never heard of us.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Our native star is Sahndara.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Millennia ago, just before it went nova, we managed to escape."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Our leader liked Plato's ideas Plato, Platonius."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,See?
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"In fact, our present philosopher-king, Parmen, sometimes calls us Plato's children, although we sometimes think of ourselves more as Plato's stepchildren."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Excuse me.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Someone's waiting for you.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Philana, they came to help."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,They deserve better than to die.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Your Pan is in jeopardy.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Help!
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Save me!
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,His mind will find me anyhow.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Don't save him.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Let him die.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,The others will kill each other trying to take his place.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,(apparently throttling himself) I can't breathe.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm choking.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Anything you want, Just ask me."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Anything.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Think nothing of it.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,You saved my life.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,I think I should tell you that
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Well, just that I never knew any people like you existed."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"They're all in chambers, meditating."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"What do you mean, like me?"
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"I thought you were talking about my size, because they make fun of me for my size."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"But, to answer your question, I'm the only one without it."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,I was brought here as the court buffoon.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"That's why I'm everybody's slave and I have to be ten places at once, and I never do anything right."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,As far as I know it just comes to you sometime after you're born.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"They say I'm a throwback, and I am, and so are you."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm sorry.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,I shouldn't have said that.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"You know, I believe you are."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Listen, where you come from, are there a lot of people without the power and my size?"
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Nobody?
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Somebody wants me.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Great Pan sounds his horn.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Marking time to the rhyme with his hoof, with his hoof."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Forward, forward in our plan."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,We proceed as we began.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Reki-kekecks, reki-kekecks."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Koobaks.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Parmen, they saved your life."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm ashamed to be a Platonian.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Ashamed!
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,He's right.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,I should have warned you.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,They were treating you the same way they treat me.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Just like me, only you fight them."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"All the time, I thought it was me, my mind that couldn't move a pebble."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"They even told I was lucky they bothered keep me around at all, and I believed them."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,The arms and legs of everybody's whim.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Look down, don't meet their eyes."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Smile.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Smile.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"These great people, they were gods to me."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,But you showed me what they really are.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"And now I know, don't you see."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"It's not me, it's not my size, it's them!"
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,It's them!
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,It's them!
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,No.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,This is the best thing for them.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm going to cut their I'm going to cut them.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Parmen first, and they'll all get infected."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"But this time, listen, whatever they say, don't save them."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Let them die.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,At least let me give them a taste of what they gave me.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Please, they're going to kill you anyway."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,You know that.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,That's the first time anybody ever thought of my life before his own.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,I should have told you when you first came here that they were going to kill you.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Because I knew, but I was afraid."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,I was afraid.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Anything I can do to help, you just tell me."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"No, not until we came to this planet."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,How could I forget that?
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,It was exactly six months and fourteen days after we got here that they started pushing me around.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Well, four, I think."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Or three.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,That's right.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Not that I'm afraid or anything, but will it hurt much?"
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Oh.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,You mean the same thing that kept me from having the power made me a dwarf?
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,He's right.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Do you know, Parmen says each has his own separate power frequency, because before when they've tried to combine their powers, and use them together, it never worked."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Oh, no."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Not after what they've done to me.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,You think that's what I want?
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Become one of them?
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Become my own enemy?
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Just lie around like a big blob of nothing and have things done for me?
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,I want to move around for myself.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"If I'm going to laugh or cry, I want do it for myself."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,You can keep your precious power.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,All I ask is one thing.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"If you do make it out of here, take me with you."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Just drop me any place they never heard of kironide or Platonius.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Don't stop me.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,Let me finish him off.
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Parmen, listen to me."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"I could have had your power, but I didn't want it."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"I could have had your place right now, but the sight of you and your Academicians sickens me."
ALEXANDER,Plato's Stepchildren,"Despite your brains, you're the most contemptible things that ever lived in this universe."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,That's right.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Who are the inhabitants of this planet?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Bones, I can't understand why a simple cut like that could become so serious."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,(They leave.)
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"This psychokinetic power of yours, how long have you had it?"
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,That's why you have no resistance?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Engines at full speed.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Get her out of orbit and into space.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Then there's nothing you can do but batten down and weather.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Parmen's mind is not (something flies past them very fast) Watch it!
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"He's not only throwing around furniture, he's tearing up the Enterprise as well."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Bones, knock him out fast."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Alexander.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Stand behind me.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Hurry up with that shot!
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Bones!
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Shake him.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Break his concentration.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Good.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,I think you'll find the orbit lock is broken as well.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Assess damage and repair whatever is necessary.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,No thanks is necessary.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Oh, thank you, we must return to the ship."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Well, in that case, we'll stay."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Thank you, Alexander."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Tell me what?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Where is everyone?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Alexander, are there other Platonians like you?"
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Who don't have the psychokinetic ability.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Don't worry about it.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,We're happy without it.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Alexander, where I come from, size, shape, or colour makes no difference, and nobody has the power."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,That might not be easy should Parmen die.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Yes.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,This utopia of theirs is one of the best-kept secret in the galaxy.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Screening themselves from our sensors, locking us into orbit."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,All this adds up to a pattern.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"If ever there was a time to get out of here, it is now."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Scotty, come in."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Prepare to beam us up.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,The turbulence hit you that hard?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,What caused it?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Did you get up into space?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"All right, Scotty."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,I'll handle it down here.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Stand by.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Your Excellency.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"I would like to know why the ship's instrumentation and weaponry is frozen, and why the Enterprise is locked in orbit."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Parmen, I've talked to the engineer aboard the ship."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,We've showed our good faith.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Now you show yours.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,I want this ship released immediately.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Guests?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,You don't know the meaning of the word.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Guests aren't treated like common prisoners.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Acknowledge.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Acknowledge.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Enterprise.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,I can't raise them.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"No, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,One thing for certain.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Parmen is not concerned with my dignity or safety.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Where are you going?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Has the Enterprise been released yet?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Certainly.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Has the Enterprise been released yet?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Then good day, and thank you for the presents."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Doctor McCoy saved your life.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,And you consider yourself a disciple of Plato?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"And if his mind isn't strong enough, he gets torn apart like Alexander."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,We don't use our weapons for the kind of brutality you practice.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Come on, Doctor."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,McCoy.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,No.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,You're the doctor.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,They don't want to force you.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,They need your goodwill.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,They're trying
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,We're not leaving until McCoy is released.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"You're not staying, McCoy."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,No matter what he tries to
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Being your slave, what should I do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire?"
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"I have no precious time at all to spend, nor services to do, till you"
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,McCoy.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"No matter what he makes me say or do, the answer's no."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Is this your utopia, your grand vision of the future?"
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,You don't even (screams)
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Spock.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Spock.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Don't let them break you.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Hold on.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Don't
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Can you do anything for him?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"My muscles are sore, that's all."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Which just goes to prove that there's no such thing as a perfect solution.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Yes, Spock."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Great anger.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,You can't.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Promised?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Parmen?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"He'd let us beam up to the Enterprise, and plunge the ship back into the atmosphere."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Because, if he killed us outright in front of you, you'd retaliate."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,You're a doctor.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,You have the means.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Bones, I know you're trying to do the right thing, but if any one of us escaped, Parmen knows Starfleet would never let this planet go unpunished."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Sacrifice yourself by agreeing to stay, and you sign our death warrant."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Put it down.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Put it down.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Do what I say.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Give it to me!
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"In that case, what's the point in you dying too, Alexander?"
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Give it to me.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,That's all right.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"It's all right, Alexander."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Listen, we haven't given up, and there may be something you can do to help."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,All right.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Did the Platonians always have this power?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Bones, I think it'd be a good idea if you took a reading of Alexander's blood."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"You still have a tricorder reading of Parmen's blood, don't you?"
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"And if our theory works out, we've got a weapon."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Kironide.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,It's a high-energy source.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,That could be it.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Exactly.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"McCoy, there must be a quick way of building up a concentration of kironide in our blood."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,What are we waiting for?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"What is it, Bones?"
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Yes.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,There are thirty eight of them.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Let's not any waste time.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Give us double the concentration in Parmen's bloodstream.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Yes.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,What about Alexander?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Why not?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,You could conceivably take Parmen's place and run the whole planet.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Alexander.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Nurse.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Lieutenant Uhura.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,I guess we weren't sufficiently entertaining.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Spock, do you feel any effect of the kironide shot?"
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,So did l. Let's try a simple test.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Concentrate on raising this plate of fruit.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Nothing.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Not yet, Parmen."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,You have to convince the doctor first.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,That's the way they want you to feel.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,It makes them think that they're alive.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Try not to think of them.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Try.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"You're half dead, all of you!"
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,You've been dead for centuries.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"We may disappear tomorrow, but at least we're living now, and you can't stand that, can you?"
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,You're half crazy because there's nothing inside.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Nothing.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,And you have to torture us to convince yourselves you're superior.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,(throwing down the whip.)
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,I did.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Platonians, listen to me."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,The next one of you that tries any trick will get hurt.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Not only do we have your psychokinetic abilities, but at twice your power level."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Do you want to be like him?
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"To us, killing is murder, even for revenge."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,But there will be other starships.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,I don't believe you.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Just remember, we can recreate that power in a matter of hours, so don't try anything."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"You're very good at making speeches, Parmen."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Just make sure that this one sinks in.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Now move aside.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Alexander.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Mister Scott, prepare to beam us up."
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,I have a little surprise for you.
KIRK,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm bringing a visitor aboard.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,Welcome to our republic.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,Whom among you is the physician?
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,My spouse.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,His leg.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,Come this way.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"Alexander, you talk too much."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,Two and a half.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,Ever since our arrival here on Platonius.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,Brain waves.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"No, not if they're embedded in the unconscious."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,We haven't had any pressing need for the medical arts.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"You see, while still on Sahndara, we instituted a mass eugenics programme."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,We're the result.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"Pared down to a population of thirty eight, we're perfect for our utopia."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,We're bred for contemplation and self-reliance.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,And longevity.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,How old would you say I am?
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,Don't be afraid.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm not vain.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,That old?
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,I stopped aging at thirty.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"Well, anyway, you're off by two thousand years."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm two thousand three hundred years old.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,We were married very young.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"I was only a hundred and seventeen, and he was a hundred and twenty eight."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"So you see, we scarcely have to move anymore, let alone work."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,That's right.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,A break in the skin or a cut can be fatal.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"Now, Doctor!"
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"I don't know how I can ever thank you, not only for Platonius, but for myself."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"Alexander, show our guests to the south wing."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"Gentle spacemen, we are eternally in your debt."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,We've some trifles for you.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,Please accept them as tokens of our gratitude.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,They stem from the very source of our inspiration.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"To our noble captain, the shield carried by Pericles, as a symbol of gallant leadership."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"To our silent and cerebral Mister Spock, this kithara to pluck music, to soothe his ever-active brow."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"And lastly, to the physician Doctor McCoy, who saved Platonius and my spouse, this ancient collection of Greek cures, penned by Hippocrates himself."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,Why even discuss it?
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,Get rid of them.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"You must be joking, Doctor."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,"Parmen, let's get on with it."
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,Parmen.
PHILANA,Plato's Stepchildren,What's going on?
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,I am.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,What's the problem?
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"Well, what happened to that leg?"
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,I don't understand.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,This should have been attended to immediately.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"Well, we're certainly going to try."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,The infection is massive.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,Let me give you a hypo to ease the pain.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,In the arm.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,I'll let you know when I have the results.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"And from now on, it would be better if I handled the instruments without your help."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"Neither do I, but it has."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,How do I knock out an infection when the tricorder doesn't show any information on Platonius bacteria?
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"All I can do, and this is going to take time, is to try to match his bugs with a known strain and hope."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,What about medicine?
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,Why no doctors?
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,I think I'd better wait until the fever breaks.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"Jim, my concoction actually worked."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,The fever's broken.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,And what recuperative powers.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,The infection's begun to drain already.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,He may still need the ship's medical stores.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,Why prevent contact?
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,I don't know.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"I don't want to go, but I can't help myself."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"I'm very sorry, but that's impossible."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,The answer is no.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"I can't move, Jim."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,They're going to keep me here no matter what.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"Leave, please."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,You won't persuade me.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,Stop it!
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"Don't do this to him, Parmen!"
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"No, Parmen!"
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,Stop it!
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,I have my orders.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,And we've had too much of yours.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,I'll never get me to stay here.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,He's a Vulcan.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,You can't force emotion out of him.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,You'll destroy him.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,I beg you.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,There is no medicine that can help him.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,He'll have to come through this himself.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"The release of emotions, Mister Spock, is what keeps us healthy."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"Emotionally healthy, that is."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"Yes, Spock."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,And hatred.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,Jim.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,This is senseless.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,I've thought it over.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm staying.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,Parmen has promised me you'll be safe.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,Why?
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,Why trick me?
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,Then why wouldn't Alexander have the same power as the others?
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,You won't even know it happened.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,Of course.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"Parmen possesses the highest order of psychokinetic ability, and Alexander the lowest, in the same environmental conditions."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,I'll run both their blood samples through for a full comparative test on the tricorder.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"The one significant difference between Parmen's blood and Alexander's is a concentration of kironide, broken down by pituitary hormone."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"It'll take some doing, but it is possible."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"Even if the kironide reaches the desired effect, it still may not help us get out of here."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm ready.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"Since the kironide's broken down and injected directly into his bloodstream, it should work on him as well as us."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"Better in fact, because he's acclimated."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"They'll never do it, Jim."
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"Stop it, Parmen!"
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,Stop it!
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,I'll do whatever you want me to do.
MCCOY,Plato's Stepchildren,"I'll stay and serve you, but stop it!"
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,I suppose I scratched it.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Sheer ignorance.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Is there anything you can do?
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Where?
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,What is it?
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"What is your prognosis, Doctor?"
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Parmen will do.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Philosopher kings have no need of titles.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Captain, please."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"You are mistaken, I assure you."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"The amenities, Captain."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Allow me to remind you that I am the head of this principality.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Guests do not come barging in here, making demands and issuing orders."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Do not take that tone with me.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Captain, wait."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,I know what you're thinking.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,My humble apologies.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,You were badly used.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"In my own defence, allow me to say that my illness was more profoundly disturbing that I myself realised."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"I am sure that you, too, have been out of sorts and have been driven to fits of temper and rage."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Unlike you, however, what I think and feel, whether for good or ill, is instantly translated into reality."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"So please, find it in your heart to forgive me."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,It will be shortly.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Not at all.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,But there is one final request.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"After my nearly fatal infection, it has become obvious to us all that we cannot afford to be without a skilled physician."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Therefore we should like you, Doctor McCoy, to remain."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Your duties will be extraordinarily light.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"You'll be free to read, meditate, conduct research, whatever you like."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,You'll want for nothing.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"We should like to keep it cordial, but we are determined to have you stay, Doctor."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"I am losing patience, Captain."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,We manage to live in peace and harmony.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"My dear Mister Spock, I admit that circumstances have forced us to make a few adaptations of Plato, but ours is the most democratic society conceivable."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Anyone can, at any moment, be or do anything he wishes, even to becoming ruler of Platonius if his mind is strong enough."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Oh, come now."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,We are not children.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"In your culture, justice is the will of the stronger."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,It is forced upon people by means of weapons and fleets of spaceships.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Our justice is the will of the stronger mind, and I for one, consider it a vast improvement."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Farewell, Captain."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Captain, go while you still can."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,This is not the Enterprise.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"You are not in command, captain."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"No, my dear."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,That might offend the good doctor.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,You wish to stay?
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,By all means.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,You can help us celebrate our anniversary.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"In the process, I hope we can persuade you to join our tiny republic."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,I think we will.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Well, Doctor?"
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"As you wish, Doctor."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,We've had enough or your moralising.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,You will be happy to stay.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"It takes a little time, Doctor, but you will be happy to stay."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"We can't let him die laughing, can we?"
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,How can you let this go on?
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Fellow academicians.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Twenty five hundred years ago, a band of hearty vagabonds arrived on this barren, rough-hewn planet."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,There was a desperate hardship of backbreaking toil.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,And then a divine providence graced our genius and our dedication with the power of powers.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"And through it, our every need instantly materialised."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,We thereupon determined to form a utopian brotherhood.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"This night is indeed a festive occasion, for tonight, we welcome into that brotherhood its first new member."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Doctor, please."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,You have destroyed the festive mood of the ladies.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,We must recapture it at once.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,I know.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,What would be better than a serenade from the laughing spaceman?
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,And now let the revels begin.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"You are so impatient, my wife."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Observe the doctor and learn.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,He's quite content to wait for the piece de resistance.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Alexander again.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,He likes to play with knives.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Very well, we shall indulge him."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Who did that?
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Not twice mine!
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Captain, no!"
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,Captain!
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"I beg of you, I'll do anything you say."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,I do not wish to die.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Captain, do you hear me?"
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Captain, you knew that I intended to destroy both you and the Enterprise, yet you spared me."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,There's no need for concern.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,They'll be safe.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Of late, I have begun to think that we've become bizarre and unproductive."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,We are existing merely to nourish our own power.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,It's time for some fresh air.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,We shall welcome your interstellar visits.
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Understood, Captain."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"And you're right, none of us can be trusted."
PARMEN,Plato's Stepchildren,"Uncontrolled, power will turn even saints into savages, and we can all be counted upon to live down to our lowest impulses."
ERACLITUS,Plato's Stepchildren,(moving an Urn by thought) It isn't now.
ERACLITUS,Plato's Stepchildren,I win.
ERACLITUS,Plato's Stepchildren,"I thank you, Dioniyde."
ERACLITUS,Plato's Stepchildren,Make up your minds.
ERACLITUS,Plato's Stepchildren,"Remember, Cupid's arrow kills Vulcans."
ERACLITUS,Plato's Stepchildren,(general laughter)
ERACLITUS,Plato's Stepchildren,Impossible!
DIONIYDE,Plato's Stepchildren,"Well played, Eraclitus."
DIONIYDE,Plato's Stepchildren,"Oh, how faithless and fickle."
DIONIYDE,Plato's Stepchildren,"Careful, Mister Spock."
DIONIYDE,Plato's Stepchildren,Too much love is dangerous.
DIONIYDE,Plato's Stepchildren,What is this?
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,How is the power transmitted?
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Do these waves cease while you are asleep?
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Thirty five.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,I believe we're experiencing the psychokinetic manifestations of Parmen's delirium.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,How does one obtain the power?
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Captain, it will be very gratifying to leave here."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Even if he shouldn't.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Doctor McCoy, you may yet cure the common cold."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Obviously Parmen does not wish any contact made with the Enterprise.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,To shut out any knowledge of his brutal treatment of a Starfleet captain.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Agreed, Captain."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,And Parmen wouldn't have treated you so brutally if he had any intention of releasing you or the Enterprise.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Whose harmony?
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Yours?
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Plato wanted truth and beauty, and above all, justice."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Two spacemen marching to a drum.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"KIRK +  We slith among the mimsey toves, and gyre among the borogoves."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"I trust they did not injure you too much, Captain."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,The humiliation must have been most difficult for you to bear.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,I can understand.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"That may be, Doctor."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"However, I have noted that the healthy release of emotion is frequently very unhealthy for those closest to you."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,So it would seem.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Captain.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Do you still feel anger toward Parmen?
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"And you, Doctor?"
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Then you must release it, gentlemen, as I must master mine."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"I might have seriously injured you, Captain, even killed you."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"They have evoked such great hatred in me, I cannot allow it to go further."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,I must master it.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,I must control.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"Alexander, it is possible for you to recall how long after you arrived here that that power began to develop?"
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,And would you know how many months' supplies you brought with you?
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"That's close enough, Alexander."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Their power developed two or three months after they started eating the native foods.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Then it is logical to assume that there is a connection between the psychokinetic power and the eating of the native foods.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Perhaps his system cannot absorb the crucial element.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,The probabilities are that Alexander was born with some biochemical deficiency relative to Platonius.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,The pituitary hormones confirm the hypothesis.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,They also regulate body growth.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Yes.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,It's also obvious why Parmen kept this little utopia secret.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Anyone coming down here and remaining long enough would acquire the power.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,The point is well taken.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"However, the psychokinetic power is not additive."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"If it were, considering the Platonians' hostile propensities, two or three of them would have combined forces centuries ago and deposed Parmen."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,The time factor concerns me.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,It may take days or even weeks before there's enough build up from the kironide to be of any benefit to us.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"I have experienced a slight flush, Captain."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"(singing) Take care, young ladies, and value your wine."
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Be watchful of young men in their velvet prime.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,We have tried.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,I haven't the power.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm deeply sorry.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,We've failed you.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,Quite possible and logical.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,That would be highly uncharacteristic.
SPOCK,Plato's Stepchildren,"We must expect, Parmen, that the moment we leave here, your fear would be gone and you would again be as sadistic and as arrogant as your twenty five hundred years have made you."
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,Scott to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,"Captain, we're in the midst of a storm."
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,"No discernible cause, and I've never seen anything like it."
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,There's
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,Ten scale turbulence right now.
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,Emergency gyros and stabilisers at maximum.
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,"If this keeps up, Captain, we can't last!"
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,"I've tried that, sir."
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,She's locked tight.
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,"Right, Captain."
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,Scott on the Enterprise.
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,"It's all right, Captain."
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,The turbulence has abated.
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,"Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,"Scott here, sir."
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,"I'm afraid I can't do that, sir."
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,Everything's frozen.
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,"It's not the turbulence, sir."
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,Damage to the ship is minimal.
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,"I don't know, sir, and those are the facts."
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,"No, sir."
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,The orbit's locked tighter than ever.
SCOTT,Plato's Stepchildren,"And subspace communication with Starfleet, it's completely severed."
CHAPEL,Plato's Stepchildren,Are we ever glad to see you.
CHAPEL,Plato's Stepchildren,I thought I was sleepwalking.
CHAPEL,Plato's Stepchildren,I couldn't stop myself.
CHAPEL,Plato's Stepchildren,"Captain, what is it?"
CHAPEL,Plato's Stepchildren,What's going on?
CHAPEL,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm so ashamed.
CHAPEL,Plato's Stepchildren,Please make them stop.
CHAPEL,Plato's Stepchildren,"Please, please make them stop."
CHAPEL,Plato's Stepchildren,For so long I've wanted to be close to you.
CHAPEL,Plato's Stepchildren,Now all I want to crawl away and die.
UHURA,Plato's Stepchildren,We were forced in the transporter and beamed down.
UHURA,Plato's Stepchildren,It was like becoming someone's puppet.
UHURA,Plato's Stepchildren,"(in Kirk's arms) I'm so frightened, Captain."
UHURA,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm so very frightened.
UHURA,Plato's Stepchildren,"I know it, but I wish I could stop trembling."
UHURA,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm thinking.
UHURA,Plato's Stepchildren,I'm thinking of all the times on the Enterprise when I was scared to death and I would see you so busy at your commands.
UHURA,Plato's Stepchildren,And I would hear your voice from all the parts of the ship and my fears would fade.
UHURA,Plato's Stepchildren,And now they are making me tremble.
UHURA,Plato's Stepchildren,But I'm not afraid.
UHURA,Plato's Stepchildren,I am not afraid.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What do your sensors read?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Specify.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,You do that.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Lieutenant Uhura, does the location of the distress call correspond with this area"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Exactly?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Check co-ordinates.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Is it the same area?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Well, apart from the landing party, there's no one here."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,There are no Scalosians.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Check circuits for malfunctions.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Kirk out.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"When we've run analysis, we should have some explanation."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,(waves away a buzz) But there is an insect life.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,It registers in my ears.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Nothing, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,No sign of present life?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Something was here.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,We saw them on the screen.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Lieutenant Uhura is still getting a distress call.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What happened?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Mister Spock, I want you to run a survey, a complete survey of the planet using all ship's available instruments."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What happened?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Lieutenant Uhura, start a replay of the distress call."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Scotty, are the transporter controls functioning now?"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"No, he's in Sickbay."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Doctor McCoy is running a check on the landing party.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"What is it, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Mister Sulu, I would like"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Have repair crews been assigned?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Play it.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Freeze it.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"The fact remains, when we beamed down there we couldn't find these people."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"They were there, now they're not."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Nor is Crewman Compton.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Mister Sulu, I want the ship on standby alert while we continue the investigation."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Scotty, assist."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Mister Spock, ever since we beamed up from Scalos, we've had a series of malfunctions."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,I want an investigation and an explanation.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Can't it wait, Bones?"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What do you read so far?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,On my way.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Mister Spock, you have the conn."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What is it?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Anything missing?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Thank you.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,That fits in with other disturbances.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Bones, what did your readings show up on the other men?"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Any of them report any unusual experience since beaming?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Hold on.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Bones, could something be making me hallucinate?"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"I mean that twice before something touched me, and there was nothing there."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,And it's just happened again.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Could I be imagining it?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,But am I hallucinating?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Then we did beam something aboard.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Something has invaded the ship.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Kirk to Spock.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Come in.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Spock, come in."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Spock, I can't hear you."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Check your circuits.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Is there a malfunction?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Lieutenant, ship wide order."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Use communicators instead of intercom.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Issue phasers to all crew members.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Spock, repeat."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Meet me there on the double.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Spock?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Phasers on stun.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Sweep the area.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What is it?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Hooked into the life support.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Designed to affect it.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Disconnect it.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,(Spock gets a shock from it) Destroy it.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,That was no force field.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Something shoved me back.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,They're in here.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,You!
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What are you doing on my ship?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Show yourselves!
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,A show of strength.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Have your readings been fed into the computer?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Read out.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,We will not negotiate.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Do you concur?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Mister Spock?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Yeoman, is that coffee available, or have those circuits been damaged as well?"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,(takes a cup from her tray) My recommendation?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Make them take the next step.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Spock?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Would you mind explaining (she kisses him) Who are you?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,You're the enemy?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What have you done with my men?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Nothing?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Mister Spock?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Scotty.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,This is nothing?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Lieutenant.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Sulu.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,This is nothing?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What have you done?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Why?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Deela.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Is this why you sabotaged my ship?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,You said we?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What about my ship?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,My crew?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"(draws his phaser) This won't kill you, but the stun effect is not very pleasant."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"If I agree to go with you, will you set this ship to rights?"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Take out that device in the life-support system?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Compton, did they accelerate you?"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,They hooked something into the life support system.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,They're in there.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,We've got to get rid of it.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,By whose order?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"I'm your commander, Compton."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,I order you to let me in.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Who is?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Deela?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Is that who you're working for?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"All right, Compton."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What is that device doing on my ship?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Approve of it?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,We're your prisoners.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,He was so young.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,This is what you have planned for us?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Kirk to Spock, I have fed all the ascertainable facts into the computer banks."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Hyperacceleration is the key.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"I have counted only five of them aboard, but they have taken over the ship, and we are under their control due to this acceleration."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"They are able to speed others up to their level, as they did Compton and me."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Presumably, this is enslavement?"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Those so treated exist at this accelerated level, becoming docile eventually."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,But when
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Damaged, they age incredibly fast, as though accelerated living"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Burns them out.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Compton was burned out.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"The device attached to the life-support system produces an extreme, numbing cold."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,It is my belief that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze for purposes only the Scalosians know.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,The unit has a protective shield which does not allow any physical contact.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Why are you doing this?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,I really want to know.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What about the rest of my crew?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Not by killing others.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,You invaded my ship.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,You threaten my crew.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,There is a difference!
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Your trouble is in you.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Did they solve anything?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Have you tried any other way?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Deela, have your scientists disconnect, destroy that unit."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"I promise you, we'll use every skill we have to help you."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,We'll move you to another planet.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,We'll call on the most brilliant minds in our Federation to help.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,We'll do it
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,I panicked.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,I'd like to leave before he activates the suspended animation device.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,It was working before.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Try it again.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,The technicians reported a loss of power.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,That must be it.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Yes, of course."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,I believe in honest relationships myself.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,A room should reflect its occupant.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Well, if she's pretty enough, I'll look."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,A bit.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,But now.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Was I too crude?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Yes.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,I know.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What happened?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,There is an insect life.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,My ears register it.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"This device attached to the life-support system produces an extreme, numbing cold."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,It is my belief that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,The unit has protective shield which does not allow any physical contact.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,No.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,No.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Yes, I hope so."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,I said I hoped I behaved correctly.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Why are we here?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Oh, yes."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,That was wrong of me.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,But we are going to Scalos?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Oh, yes."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,They'll be all right.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What's the matter?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Am I behaving incorrectly?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Those are undesirable qualities.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,I'm sorry.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,We could put you in suspended animation until we determine what to do with you.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"No, it doesn't."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,What do you want us to do with you?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"If I sent you to Scalos, you'd undoubtedly play the same trick on the next spaceship that passed by."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Yes, I suppose it would."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,And very brief.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Oh, no."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,I can think of nothing I'd rather do than stay with you.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Except staying alive.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Energise.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Well, Mister Spock, what have you got?"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Let's test it.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,(drinks the contents of a small vial) Nothing's happening.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Mister Spock.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Out of the nowhere into the here.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Scotty.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,I think we've located Mister Spock.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Lieutenant, are your circuits clearing?"
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Cancel Red Alert, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Open all channels.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Captain to crew.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Repairs are now being effected by Mister Spock.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,The ship will resume normal operations almost immediately.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,"Mister Spock, my compliments to your repair work and yourself."
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Yes.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,No malfunctions anywhere?
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,(sees the Scalosians on the viewscreen) Lieutenant.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,That's no malfunction.
KIRK,Wink Of An Eye,Goodbye Deela.
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,"They register something, sir, but I'm blessed if I can figure out what it is."
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,I can't get a fix on it.
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,Sensors don't pinpoint a location.
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,We may have a malfunction.
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,"I'm about to check circuits, sir."
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,Is Mister Spock still down there?
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,Aye.
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,I had some.
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,Was it the coffee?
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,"Are we going to go too, just like the captain?"
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,By that time it'll be too late.
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,"Can we use phasers to cut through that wall, bypass the force field and get at that unit?"
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,Can we find some way of coping with them on theirs?
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,"Captain Kirk, where the blazes did you come from?"
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,"And Mister Spock, is he coming too?"
SCOTT,Wink Of An Eye,This panel is being recircuited at incredible speed.
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,I am still receiving visual contact.
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"I can see them, but I can't see you."
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"Co-ordinates correspond, Captain."
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"The distress call is very strong, Captain."
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,They are pleading for immediate assistance.
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"Malfunction, sir."
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,Captain.
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,It corrected itself.
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"The tape is ready, sir."
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"That would explain our continuing to receive it while our sensors only picked up the landing party, sir."
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"Captain, intercom system is breaking down rapidly."
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,Captain.
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,Captain Kirk!
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,He's gone!
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"Well, he was sitting there."
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,He'd just drunk his coffee and set his cup down.
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,You see it's still there.
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,And then he vanished.
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"I'm sorry, sir."
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,I touched the tape button accidentally.
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,I'll take it off.
UHURA,Wink Of An Eye,"No, sir."
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,It must be a malfunction.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,This is a barren world.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,"There's hardly any vegetation, no apparent animal life."
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,My tricorder doesn't register it.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,Compton!
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,McCoy to Captain Kirk.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,Captain's presence for examination is requested.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,"Your orders, Jim."
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,You're the last one.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,Can we discuss it here?
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,Tell the captain what you told me.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,"Lie down, Jim."
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,All perfectly normal.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,Whatever happened to Compton down there apparently had no effect on anyone else.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,No.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,There's no mention of it.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,I'm not finished yet.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,What do you mean?
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,"Physically, there's nothing wrong with you."
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,I'd say no.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,"There's no question about it, Spock."
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,I want you to take a look at this.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,"The same substance is in the captain's coffee as in the Scalosian water, and there's no trace of it in any other cups."
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,I've been hearing that whine ever since we beamed down to Scalos.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,Compton!
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,I was looking at him.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,"I was looking right at him, and then he just wasn't there"
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,My tricorder doesn't register it.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,This is a barren world.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,"Limited vegetation, no apparent animal life."
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,McCoy to Spock.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,"I've found a tape in the computer down here, and when I try to read it, all I get is a whine."
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,Finished.
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,"Most effectively under laboratory conditions, but the question is will it work in the human body?"
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,"And the second question is, how do we get it to the captain?"
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,"Spock, you don't know what that'll do to you."
MCCOY,Wink Of An Eye,Just like Compton.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Evidently a civilisation of high order, rating number seven on the industrial scale."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Humanoid in appearance, according to the paintings."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"An abundance of literature, which I shall have translated and processed."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Certain structures hold evidence of recent occupancy while others are apparently long abandoned.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Instrument readings indicate life-form, but of a highly unusual and intermittent nature."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,They have no discernible form or location.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"A most puzzling phenomenon, Captain."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,I shall have to study it further.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Unknown at present, Captain."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,It is logical to assume that this distress call was pre-recorded.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,What we received was evidently a delayed taped message.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,It would seem that some force or agent only partially discernible to our instruments may have been responsible.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"(bad static) Captain, I have a reading from Life Support centre"
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,I have a reading from Life Support centre.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Alien substances being introduced.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"It is a force field, Captain, the nature of which I'm not familiar with."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"I'm getting readings of an alien presence similar to those obtained on the planet's surface, but they seem to have no exact location."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"It would seem, Captain, that they intend to allow only the two of us to enter."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,I should advise caution.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Unknown, Captain."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,But it is evidently a device of alien origin.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Life support is still operating.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,I would say that the installation is incomplete.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"It seems that we may look at it, Captain, but that is all."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Yes.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Evidently they are convinced that we can do nothing to stop them, and they wish to impress upon us what they can do to us."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Affirmative.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Computer, analyse and reply."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Have we been invaded?
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Nature and description of enemy forces.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Number of enemy forces.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Purpose of the invasion?
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Is there a connection between this and Compton's disappearance?
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Are we at present capable of resisting?
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Your recommendation?
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Your recommendations, Captain?"
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Lieutenant, did you see what happened?"
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Mister Sulu, do you verify?"
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,I'm getting a trace reading similar to that on the planet.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Mister Sulu, did you drink your coffee?"
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Did anyone else?
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,May I?
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,I cannot give you that answer until these have been analysed.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"I suggest that we recall the captain's words, Make them take the next step."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,It would seem they have taken it.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,And we must determine effective countermeasures.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Mister Scott, you have the conn."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,I shall be in the medical lab.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Nurse, programme the information and determine whether we can find counteragents."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"(there's a buzz) Doctor, did you just"
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,I know what it is.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,We brought it with us from Scalos.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"If you'll excuse me, I shall be on the bridge."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Lieutenant, will you replay the Scalosian distress call on my viewer?"
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Spock here.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Bring it to the bridge at once, Doctor."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Lieutenant Uhura, notify the rest of the crew."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Mister Scott, we cannot cope with them on our level."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,That is a very logical suggestion.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Stand by in the transporter room.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Yes, it counteracts the substance most effectively."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,By drinking the Scalosian water.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,(and does so)
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,It is somewhat stimulating.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"You seem to be moving very slowly, Doctor."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"If you will devote yourself exclusively to the concerns of Scalos, madam, we shall be pleased to remain and take care of the Enterprise."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,Doctor McCoy and I have synthesised a possible counteragent to the Scalosian water.
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Regrettably, we did not have the opportunity to test it."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"You do seem to be moving very slowly, Captain."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,"Thank you, Captain."
SPOCK,Wink Of An Eye,I found it an accelerating experience.
SULU,Wink Of An Eye,"Captain, there's some trouble on the hangar deck."
SULU,Wink Of An Eye,The controls are frozen.
SULU,Wink Of An Eye,"Yes, sir."
SULU,Wink Of An Eye,"Sir, now I have readings that deflectors are inoperative."
SULU,Wink Of An Eye,The controls are frozen.
SULU,Wink Of An Eye,That's just what happened.
SULU,Wink Of An Eye,"He was there, then all of a sudden he wasn't there."
SULU,Wink Of An Eye,Yes.
SULU,Wink Of An Eye,Somebody's repairing every console on the ship.
SULU,Wink Of An Eye,"Aye, sir."
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,"To any and all space travellers passing within range of the planet Scalos, I send you an urgent appeal for help."
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,My comrades and I are the last surviving members of what was once a thriving civilisation.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,We have no explanation for what has been happening to us.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Our number is now five.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,We were once a nation of nine hundred thousand.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Stun.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,You were ordered to stop him.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Why did you disobey?
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,He was violent.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,He had to be subdued.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,(to a young woman) Another will be secured for you.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,It may be.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,"He is inferior, Deela."
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,You cannot allow yourself to feel an attachment to such.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,I do my duty.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Deela will explain it.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,"Go ahead, Captain."
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,"It is not yet completely linked to your support system, but it is in operating order."
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Study it if you wish.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,I suggest that you do not touch it.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,"The unit has its own self-defence mechanism, as you see."
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,You should've heeded me.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,"In your struggle with Compton, some of his cells were damaged."
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Those newly accelerated to our level are sensitive to cell damage.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,They age rapidly and die.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Was.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Perhaps he will be less violent now.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Why do you care what he feels?
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,I have noted that.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,"Go to the transporter room, Deela."
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Signal me when you're there and beam down.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Yes.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,I'll activate our unit and follow you.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,I'm setting it to allow all of us time to get off the ship.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Please don't delay.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,"Go after him, Deela."
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Beam him down at once.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,What'd he do to it?
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,I heard him.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,You expect me to believe him?
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,"To any and all space travellers passing within range of the planet Scalos, I send you an urgent appeal for help."
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,My comrades and I are the last surviving members of what was once a thriving civilisation.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,We have no explanation for what's happening to us.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,"(Spock slows down the playback, then speeds it up) Those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area."
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,We have no explanation for what's happening to us.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Nation of nine hundred thousand.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,City alone holding one hundred thirteen thousand.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,On which existed several culturally enlightened Indigenous population
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,This is the only damage?
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Go get the others and bring them up here.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,(into comm.)
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Deela.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Deela?
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Deela!
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Then don't torment me.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,You know how I feel.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,No.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,I have more work to do.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,I've beamed the others down.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,It would've been an intrusion.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Come up when you wish.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Signal me when you are ready.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,In life support.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,I have to activate our unit.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,I know.
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,"The unit is activated, Deela."
RAEL,Wink Of An Eye,Beam down at once.
CHAPEL,Wink Of An Eye,"Something's going on, Captain."
CHAPEL,Wink Of An Eye,Somebody's opened all the medical supply cabinets.
CHAPEL,Wink Of An Eye,"Just disordered, as though someone had picked up everything and examined it."
CHAPEL,Wink Of An Eye,He's gone.
COMPUTER,Wink Of An Eye,Affirmative.
COMPUTER,Wink Of An Eye,Data insufficient.
COMPUTER,Wink Of An Eye,Data insufficient.
COMPUTER,Wink Of An Eye,"Immediate purpose, seizure and control of Federation Star ship Enterprise and crew."
COMPUTER,Wink Of An Eye,Data insufficient for determination of end purpose.
COMPUTER,Wink Of An Eye,Data insufficient.
COMPUTER,Wink Of An Eye,Negative.
COMPUTER,Wink Of An Eye,"If incapable of resistance, negotiate for terms."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,(the woman from the distress call) Captain.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Deela.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,The enemy.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Yes.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You beamed me aboard yourself when you came up.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"A ridiculously long process, but I've taken care of it."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Nothing.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,There's really nothing wrong with them.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,They are just as they have always been.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,It's you who are different.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"They cannot hear you, Captain."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"To their ears, you sound like an insect."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"That's your description, Captain."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Accurate, if unflattering."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Really, there is nothing wrong with them."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Changed you.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,So you are like me now.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Your crew cannot see you or any of us because of the acceleration.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,We move in the wink of an eye.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Oh, there is a scientific explanation for it, but all that really matters is that you can see me and talk to me, and we can go on from there."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Because I like you.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Didn't you guess?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Or are you so accustomed to being kissed by invisible women?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Oh, but it has not been sabotaged."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,We we had to make some changes in it to adjust it to us.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Yes.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Of course.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,My chief scientist and his crew.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I am their queen.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You are going to be their king.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You'll enjoy living on Scalos.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Oh, in a few of their moments, they will realise that you've vanished."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"They will look for you, but they will not find you."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You're accelerated far beyond their power to see.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,So they'll go on without you.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Don't be so stubborn.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"You cannot go back to them, ever."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Is it so dreadful a prospect?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,But that won't work.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You go ahead and try.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Point it right at me.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,My reactions are much too fast for such a crude weapon.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"And I am quite good at self-defense, too."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"This can be set for stun and destroy, too, like yours."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"(his phaser goes flying) Please, accept what has happened."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,There is nothing you can do to change it.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Don't be so silly.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You'll feel better about it all in a little while.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,It always happens this way.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"They are very upset at first, then it wears off and they, they learn to like it."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"You will, too."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,He's on his way to you.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Be gentle with him.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I hate what happens to them when they're damaged.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"You're going to have to learn to control your temper, Rael."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I do not want that to happen to this one.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"If they are so stubborn a species, perhaps they will last longer."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I hope so.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,They all go so soon.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I want to keep this one a long time.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,He's pretty.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Oh?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I don't think so.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I can allow myself anything I want.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Oh, Rael, don't be like that."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Am I jealous of what you do?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,So do I.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,And sometimes I allow myself to enjoy it.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Hello.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"I will tell you anything you want to know, and you'll approve of it."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Hardly.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You're free to go anywhere you want to.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,He told you not to touch it.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Look at your hands.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"They're almost frozen, aren't they?"
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,It will pass.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"We all die, even on Scalos."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Why did you lie to him?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"He did not damage that one, you did."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I see no reason to make him feel any worse than he has to.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Rael, he's not one of us."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,He's temporary.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,(getting a message via her collar device) He's gone to the medical laboratory.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,He's trying to communicate with the Vulcan.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,His species is capable of much affection.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I wonder if they will demonstrate it to us.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Oh, Rael, stop sulking."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Accept it.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,We've had to accept it all our lives.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Don't make it worse.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Go back to work.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Go ahead.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"You won't accomplish anything, but it may be historically valuable."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Damaged.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Burns them out.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Quite correct.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,The unit will be activated.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"By the time they hear this, it will be too late."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"You have remarkable reasoning powers, Captain."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You were quite right in almost every assumption.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Do you really want to know?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,In a little while it won't matter to you at all.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"You'll be quite happy about it, Just as Compton was."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Oh, dear."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You are so stubborn.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,It should be obvious to you that we're doing it because we have to.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"A long time ago, it is in our history, we used to be like you."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Then our country was almost destroyed by volcanic eruptions.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,The water was polluted.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Radiation was released.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,That changed us.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,It accelerated us.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,The children died.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Most of the women found they could not have more.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,All of our men had become sterile.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,So we had to mate outside our own people.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Whenever a spaceship came by, we'd send our calls for help."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,But accelerating them to our level burned them out.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Don't you see, Captain?"
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Do I have to go into every detail?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,We are going to take you down with us.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Perhaps one or two others of your crew.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,We have to.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,We'll be kind to you.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"I wouldn't hurt you, certainly."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I do like you.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,They'll remain here in suspended animation.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,It will do them no harm.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,We are saving them for when we need them in the future.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You will not last forever.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"You know that, Captain."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Captain, we have the right to survive."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You were doing exactly the same thing.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You came charging into that life-support room the minute you knew there was trouble.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You would have killed every one my people if you could have.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,There is no difference.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,We did not ask for it.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,We are not to blame.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,We are handling it the only way we know how.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,The way our parents and their parents before them.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,We have tried other ways.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,We've tried to make the transition to your level.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Some of us, that is."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Those who made the attempt died.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"We are trapped, Captain, Just as you are trapped now."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"I'm sorry for what's going to happen to you, but I cannot change it."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You cannot change me.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,With the captain?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Just what makes you think I would do that?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,The captain's gone.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Why did you run?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I don't believe that.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,(into her comm.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,unit) We're in the transporter room.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You can activate.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Captain.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"What have you done to the transporter, Captain?"
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,(into her comm.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,unit) The transporter isn't working.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Nothing.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,He didn't have time.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"It must be a, what do you call it?"
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,A malfunction.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You'd better not activate the unit yet.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"What would you say it is, Captain?"
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,The captain says his technicians
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I expect you to check into all possible causes.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"If I had a suspicious nature, Captain, I would say that you sabotaged the transporter to buy time."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I'm glad we're both innocents.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"I despise devious people, don't you?"
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Your quarters are quite like you, Captain."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Austere and efficient, and in their own way, handsome."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Absolutely.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,May I freshen up?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,All this rushing about has left me windblown.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I'm glad to see you allow yourself some comforts.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Are you married, Captain?"
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,No family?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,No attachments?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I know.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"You're married to your career, and you never look at another woman."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I wondered when you'd say something nice to me.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Am I more presentable now?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,It was quite delightful kissing you when you couldn't see me.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,But now
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,No.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I wouldn't allow you to take that no matter how much we trust each other.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,But I would've been disappointed if you hadn't tried.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Just don't try it again.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You're far too vulnerable to skin damage.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,All I have to do is scratch you.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,The difference between us is that you will come around to our way of thinking sooner or later.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,But it's better sooner than later.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,The unit will be activated.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"By the time they hear this, it will be too late."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Rael!
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Rael, stop."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Now, stop it."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Did he damage you, Captain?"
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"How very fortunate for you, Rael."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Don't you dare do anything like that again.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,It's contemptible.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I don't care what your feelings are.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I don't want to know that aspect of it.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"What I do is necessary, and you have no right to question it."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Allow me the dignity of liking the man I select.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Is the transporter repaired?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Don't you think you'd better do it?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,He loves me.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I adored him when I was a child.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I suppose I still do.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"I must say, you behaved better than he did."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,What did you say?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,And nothing bothers you now?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Our leaving was delayed.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Don't you remember?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You damaged the transporter.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Yes, it certainly was."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Do you want to?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,What about your crew?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Aren't you worried about them?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Oh.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Nothing.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"You've completely accepted the situation, haven't you?"
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You even like it.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,No!
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I liked you better before.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Stubborn and irritating and independent, like Rael."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Maybe that's why I liked you so much.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Because you were like him.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,(into comm.)
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Rael?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You don't have to worry about the captain.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,He's made the adjustment.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Is it repaired already?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Why didn't you tell me?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Where will you be?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Rael, wait."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I'm sorry.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Well, come, Captain."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,It's time to leave your pretty ship.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Your crew will be all right.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You said so yourself.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,(into comm.)
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,He's broken away.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,He's armed.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"You are very clever, Captain."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You tricked me.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,I should've known that you would never adjust.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,What shall we expect from you now?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Your survival does not depend on that.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Don't make a game of it, Captain."
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,We've lost.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,There won't be any others.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You'll warn them.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Your federation will quarantine the entire area.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,And we will die and solve your problem that way.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,And ours.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Now, what about your problem, Captain, and your Vulcan friend?"
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You could still find life on Scalos very pleasant.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,It'll be just as brief here.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,You cannot get back to your own level.
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"No answer, Captain?"
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,Do I displease you so much?
DEELA,Wink Of An Eye,"Goodbye, Captain."
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,"Captain Kirk, you've made it."
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,"Yes, sir."
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,"I'm sorry, sir."
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,Entry is forbidden.
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,"The commander, sir."
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,"You'll have to step back, please."
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,"I'm sorry, sir."
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,You are no longer.
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,"At first I refused, but then after a while I found I couldn't help myself."
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,I met this girl.
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,She's one of them.
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,I've never known anyone like her.
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,She brought me aboard to show them operation of the ship.
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,"Bridge controls, life support."
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,She explained that they wanted to know.
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,"I didn't understand at first, but I do now."
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,"So will you, sir."
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,I tried to stop him.
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,You hurt him.
COMPTON,Wink Of An Eye,He was my captain.
EKOR,Wink Of An Eye,Cell damage.
EKOR,Wink Of An Eye,"There's nothing wrong elsewhere, sir."
EKOR,Wink Of An Eye,Sufficient energy for beaming down.
KIRK,That Which Survives,A ghost planet?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Let's take the facts one by one.
KIRK,That Which Survives,That should explain something.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Its size is approximately that of Earth's moon.
KIRK,That Which Survives,That would be difficult to explain.
KIRK,That Which Survives,And yet it has.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"But a fascinating one, Mister Spock."
KIRK,That Which Survives,"It would bear closer investigation, it would seem, if we're to provide Starfleet with an accurate report."
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Lieutenant, send Doctor McCoy to the transporter room for survey party."
KIRK,That Which Survives,We'll also need Senior Geologist D'Amato.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Feed beam down co-ordinates to the transporter room.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Mister Sulu, you'll accompany me."
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Mister Spock, you have the conn."
KIRK,That Which Survives,"This expedition should be a geologist's dream, Mister D'Amato."
KIRK,That Which Survives,Yes.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"If Mister Spock is correct, you'll have a report to startle the Fifth Interstellar Geophysical Conference."
KIRK,That Which Survives,A planet that even Spock can't explain.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Prepare to transport.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Energise.
KIRK,That Which Survives,That woman attacked Ensign Wyatt.
KIRK,That Which Survives,I don't know.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Any more like that and they'll tear this planet apart.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Could seismic stress have accounted for it?
KIRK,That Which Survives,That's very strange.
KIRK,That Which Survives,And that woman.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Kirk to Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,That Which Survives,The shock may have damaged it.
KIRK,That Which Survives,For one thing it means we're stranded.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Shall we stop guessing, Mister Sulu, and try and establish a pattern?"
KIRK,That Which Survives,I get no readings of high energy concentration.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"If the Enterprise had blown up, it would have left a high residual radiation."
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Mister Sulu, if I'd wanted a Russian history lesson, I'd have brought along Mister Chekov."
KIRK,That Which Survives,"This is a matter of survival, gentlemen."
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Without the Enterprise, we need food, and we need water, and we need them fast."
KIRK,That Which Survives,"I want a detailed analysis made of this planet, and I want it now."
KIRK,That Which Survives,Mister Sulu.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Your report covers all vegetation?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Yes.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"I don't see any water, but there must be some to grow the vegetation."
KIRK,That Which Survives,A source of water would stretch our survival.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Did you see any evidence of rainfall?
KIRK,That Which Survives,But there is earth-type vegetation.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Yes, that's possible."
KIRK,That Which Survives,There's also the possibility of underground water.
KIRK,That Which Survives,This apparently is going to be our home for as long as we last.
KIRK,That Which Survives,I suggest we find out as much as we can about it.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Split up.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"D'Amato, see if you can find underground water."
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Sulu, run an atmospheric analysis."
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Bones, see if you can find out anything about the vegetation and your parasite."
KIRK,That Which Survives,How do they get their moisture?
KIRK,That Which Survives,"If you can discover how they survive, maybe we can."
KIRK,That Which Survives,Kirk here.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Kirk out.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Kirk here.
KIRK,That Which Survives,What do you mean just there?
KIRK,That Which Survives,As though a door opened and closed.
KIRK,That Which Survives,What direction?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Hang on.
KIRK,That Which Survives,D'Amato's section.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Come in.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Kirk to D'Amato.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Come in.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Come in.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Bones, Sulu, D'Amato doesn't answer."
KIRK,That Which Survives,Bones!
KIRK,That Which Survives,Digging a grave.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"There are no good ways, Sulu."
KIRK,That Which Survives,My phaser didn't cut through it.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Eight thousand degrees centigrade.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"It looks like igneous rock, but infinitely denser."
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Mister Sulu, it might explain this place a little better if we knew what the substance is."
KIRK,That Which Survives,"I know it was D'Amato's field, but see what you can find out."
KIRK,That Which Survives,Yeah.
KIRK,That Which Survives,It might be the most suitable memorial at that.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"I don't know, but something or someone did."
KIRK,That Which Survives,We've got to figure this out and devise a defence against it.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Is it possible that the rocks have life?
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Unless we're dealing with beings, intelligent beings who can shield themselves."
KIRK,That Which Survives,"That's the problem, Sulu."
KIRK,That Which Survives,We have only questions.
KIRK,That Which Survives,No answers.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Except for a momentary fluctuation on your instruments, this planet has no magnetic field."
KIRK,That Which Survives,The apparent age of these rocks is only a few thousand years.
KIRK,That Which Survives,No known process could evolve the plant life they have here in that short space of time.
KIRK,That Which Survives,The planet might be hollow.
KIRK,That Which Survives,They might be shielding themselves from our sensor probes.
KIRK,That Which Survives,It's dark.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Let's get some rest.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Tomorrow we have to find some food and some water or it's going to be a very unpleasant stay.
KIRK,That Which Survives,All right.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Take D'Amato's tricorder.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Set it for automatic distress.
KIRK,That Which Survives,You never can tell.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Hold it!
KIRK,That Which Survives,Who are you?
KIRK,That Which Survives,How can you destroy others and not me?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Who are you?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Why are you trying to kill us?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Are there men on this planet?
KIRK,That Which Survives,No!
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Bones, did you see that?"
KIRK,That Which Survives,Maybe Spock was wrong.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Perhaps this is a ghost planet.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Yes, I know."
KIRK,That Which Survives,That's a good question.
KIRK,That Which Survives,She touched the transporter chief.
KIRK,That Which Survives,He collapsed immediately.
KIRK,That Which Survives,She apparently got to D'Amato.
KIRK,That Which Survives,We saw what happened to him.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"The question is, why are you alive?"
KIRK,That Which Survives,The power to totally disrupt biological cell structure.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Sulu's alive because I intervened.
KIRK,That Which Survives,But that raises an even worse question.
KIRK,That Which Survives,She's not through yet.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Lieutenant Sulu, do you feel strong enough to move about?"
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Is he, Bones?"
KIRK,That Which Survives,All right.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Whatever destructive power this woman has seems to be aimed at one specific person at one specific time.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"If I'm correct, when she re-appears, the other two might protect the one she's after by interposing their bodies."
KIRK,That Which Survives,No weapons seem to affect her.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Controls are fused.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Drop!
KIRK,That Which Survives,Apparently she can destroy our weapons as well as destroy us.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Come on, let's go."
KIRK,That Which Survives,Yes.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Like a door opening.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Who have you come for this time?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Why do you want to kill us?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Then why do you want to kill me?
KIRK,That Which Survives,We're here on a peaceful mission.
KIRK,That Which Survives,It's you who have killed our people.
KIRK,That Which Survives,We mean no harm to you.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"We want to leave, peacefully."
KIRK,That Which Survives,An android?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Who are you?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Commander of what?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Station?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Station?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Where?
KIRK,That Which Survives,How do you feel about killing me?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Stay between us.
KIRK,That Which Survives,You want to kill me?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Then why do it if you don't want to?
KIRK,That Which Survives,By whom?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Are there others on this planet?
KIRK,That Which Survives,How long have you been alone?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Are you lonely?
KIRK,That Which Survives,"And there's this power surge, right off the scale."
KIRK,That Which Survives,Like a door closing.
KIRK,That Which Survives,It must be near here.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Right off the scale.
KIRK,That Which Survives,It's remained at a peak ever since she disappeared.
KIRK,That Which Survives,The entrance is here.
KIRK,That Which Survives,It certainly looks like it.
KIRK,That Which Survives,And the invitation doesn't exactly relax me.
KIRK,That Which Survives,I agree.
KIRK,That Which Survives,I don't know.
KIRK,That Which Survives,But whatever civilisation exists on this planet is in there.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"And without the Enterprise, gentlemen, the only source of food and water is in there."
KIRK,That Which Survives,Let's go.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Who have you come for?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Form a circle.
KIRK,That Which Survives,You see?
KIRK,That Which Survives,You'd better tell us.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Tell us.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Who have you come for?
KIRK,That Which Survives,Who have you come for?
KIRK,That Which Survives,You're a very determined woman.
KIRK,That Which Survives,For me?
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Gentlemen, I need your help."
KIRK,That Which Survives,We've seen the results of your touch.
KIRK,That Which Survives,That is how you kill.
KIRK,That Which Survives,You'll never reach me.
KIRK,That Which Survives,That computer must be programming these replicas.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Shift positions.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Spock, the computer!"
KIRK,That Which Survives,Destroy it!
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Mister Spock, I certainly am glad to see you."
KIRK,That Which Survives,I thought you and the Enterprise had been destroyed.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Returned from where?
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Was, Mister Spock."
KIRK,That Which Survives,Its defences were run by computer.
KIRK,That Which Survives,There were replicas of one of them.
KIRK,That Which Survives,But that power to recreate them has been destroyed.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"Well, you wouldn't have thought so, Mister Spock, if you'd been among us."
KIRK,That Which Survives,The computer was too perfect.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"It projected so much of Losira's personality into the replica that it felt regret, guilt, at killing."
KIRK,That Which Survives,That bought us the time we needed to destroy it.
KIRK,That Which Survives,She must have been a remarkable woman.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,That Which Survives,Five to beam up.
KIRK,That Which Survives,"I don't agree with you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,That Which Survives,Beauty survives.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"I suggest no supernatural explanation, Captain."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,I merely point out that the facts do not fit any known categories of planets.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Undoubtedly.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,The age of this planet would seem to be only a few thousand years.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,It would be impossible for vegetation to evolve in so short a period.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,But its mass and atmosphere are similar to Earth.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"It would be impossible, Captain."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,An atmosphere could not evolve in so short a period of time.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Evidently.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,But the inconsistencies are so compounded as to present a seemingly impossible phenomenon.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Precisely, Captain."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Lieutenant Rahda, report to the bridge immediately."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Yes.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,I believe no permanent damage was done.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,The occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the chair.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,That we have yet to ascertain.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Report on the death of the transporter officer.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Give me a full report as soon as possible, please."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Spock out.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Mister Scott, have the transporter checked for possible malfunction."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,The stars.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Wrong?
SPOCK,That Which Survives,A positional change.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Nine hundred and ninety point seven light years to be exact, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Mister Scott, since we are here, your statement is not only illogical but also unworthy of refutation."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"It is also illogical to assume that any explosion, even that of a small star going supernova, could have hurled us a distance of nine hundred and ninety point seven light years."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"That is correct, Mister Scott, by all the laws that we know."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,There was no period of unconsciousness.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Our ship's chronometers registered a matter of only a few seconds.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Therefore, we were displaced through space in some manner which I am unable to fathom."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Please, Mister Scott, restrain your leaps of illogic."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,I have said nothing.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,I was merely speculating.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Spock here.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Explain.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Would any known disease organism do that?
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Please keep me fully advised.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Spock out.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,He was in the transporter room.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Someone may have entered after Captain Kirk and his party left.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Mister Scott, since the Enterprise is obviously functional, I suggest we return to our starting place at top warp speed."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"In that case, Mister Scott, I suggest we start at once."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Can you give me warp eight?
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"That position, Mister Scott, would not only be unavailing but also undignified."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Lieutenant Rahda, plot a course."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Good.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Then prepare to come to warp eight.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Eleven point three three seven hours, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,I wish you would be more precise.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Spock here.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Feels, Mister Scott?"
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"That is obvious, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,I suggest you avoid emotionalism and simply keep your instruments correct.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Spock out.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Spock here.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Do you know what he died of, Mister Scott?"
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Security alert, all decks."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Female intruder, extremely dangerous."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Security alert.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,All decks.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Spock to Sickbay.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Have you completed the autopsy on Watkins, Doctor?"
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Was the cause of his death the same as that which killed the transporter officer?
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"My guess, Doctor, would be valueless."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,I suggest we refrain from guessing and find some facts.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Spock out.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"The power of this intruder to disrupt every cell in a body, combined with the almost inconceivable power required to hurl the Enterprise such a distance, speak of a very high culture and a very great danger."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"A reasonable assumption, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"If there are more of those beings on that planet, the captain and the others are in very great danger."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Very well.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Cancel Red Alert but maintain increased security.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Please update our subspace report to Starfleet to include security search, results negative."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Presumably the same way she got on.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Lieutenant, we are not engaged in gambling."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"We are proceeding in the only logical way to return to the place they were last seen, and factually ascertain whether or not they still live."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Very well.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Reduce speed to warp seven.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Bridge to Engineering.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Negative effect on power reduction.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Speed is still increasing.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"I would calculate fourteen point eight seven minutes, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Sabotage.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,You said it was fused.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,How?
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Worries, Mister Scott?"
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Interesting.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"No, but the method is fascinating."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,A force that could hurl us nine hundred and ninety point seven light years away and at that distance still be able to sabotage our main source of energy will not be waiting around to be taken into custody.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"As I recall the pattern of our fuel flow, there is an access tube leading to the matter-antimatter reaction chamber."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Still, it is there, and it might be possible to shut off the fuel at that point."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,A magnetic probe.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,I shall try.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Unless a solution is found quickly, that fate awaits all of us."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Very well, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,You spoke of the feel of the ship being wrong.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"I note it, Mister Scott, without necessarily understanding it."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"I propose to run an analysis through the ship's computers, comparing the present condition of the Enterprise with her ideal condition."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,We have twelve minutes and twenty seven seconds.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"I suggest you do whatever you can in the service crawlway, while I make the computer study."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Go ahead, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Mister Scott, I suggest you refrain from any further subjective descriptions."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,You now have ten minutes and nineteen seconds in which to perform your task.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,You now have ten minutes and ten seconds.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,I'm aware of these facts.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Please get on with the job.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Computer.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Analysis on my comparison co-ordinates.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Lieutenant Uhura, you are monitoring the magnetic force?"
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Please do not take your eyes off of it.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Lieutenant Rahda, arm the pod jettison system."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Not until my order.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Mister Scott, what is your situation?"
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"You have eight minutes, forty one seconds."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Computer read-out.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Continue.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Understood.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Spock here.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Mister Scott, ease off."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Computer, for outphase condition, will reverse field achieve closure?"
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Mister Scott
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Reverse polarity on your magnetic probe.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"That is correct, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Please commence.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,I'll explain.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,You were correct in your feel.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,The Enterprise was put through a molecular transporter and reassembled slightly out of phase.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Reverse polarity should seal the incision.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Please continue, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Please continue.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Mister Scott, you have accomplished your task."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"For what purpose, Mister Scott?"
SPOCK,That Which Survives,What is it in you humans
SPOCK,That Which Survives,That requires an overwhelming display of emotion in a situation such as this?
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Two men pursue the only reasonable course of action indicated, and yet you"
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Feel that something else is necessary.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,I had the same misgivings about you.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,We returned and picked up your life form readings only a moment ago.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,From where this brain had the power to send the Enterprise.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Nine hundred and ninety point seven light years across the galaxy.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,What a remarkable culture this is.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"I surmised that, Captain."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Its moves were immensely logical.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,But what people created this?
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Are there any representatives here?
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"That is a loss, Captain."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"To do the job of defence, the computer projected a replica of the only image available."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,Losira's.
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Beauty is transitory, Doctor."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"However, she was evidently highly intelligent."
SPOCK,That Which Survives,"Indeed, Captain?"
UHURA,That Which Survives,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,That Which Survives,Mister Spock!
UHURA,That Which Survives,Are you all right?
UHURA,That Which Survives,What happened?
UHURA,That Which Survives,"No, Mister Spock."
UHURA,That Which Survives,I meant what happened to us?
UHURA,That Which Survives,Damage control report.
UHURA,That Which Survives,Ship functioning normally.
UHURA,That Which Survives,Many bumps and bruises.
UHURA,That Which Survives,"One casualty, Mister Spock."
UHURA,That Which Survives,"The transporter officer, he's dead."
UHURA,That Which Survives,"Security sweeps of all decks are negative, Mister Spock."
UHURA,That Which Survives,No evidence of intruder.
UHURA,That Which Survives,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,That Which Survives,"All decks, cancel Red Alert."
UHURA,That Which Survives,Maintain increased security.
UHURA,That Which Survives,"How did she get off the ship, sir?"
UHURA,That Which Survives,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,That Which Survives,Mister Spock what are the chances of the captain and the others being alive?
UHURA,That Which Survives,"Yes, Mister Spock."
UHURA,That Which Survives,"Oh yes, sir."
UHURA,That Which Survives,"Magnetic force indicator jumping, Mister Spock."
UHURA,That Which Survives,"Magnetic force has dropped to normal, sir."
UHURA,That Which Survives,Magnetic forces steady.
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,"The opportunity to explore so young a planet is an incredible bit of luck, Captain."
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,Captain.
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,Captain!
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,"Captain, this tremor we felt, if that's what it was, it's certainly like no seismic disturbance I've ever felt before."
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,"I got a reading of almost immeasurable power, but it's not there any more."
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,The reading I got had nothing to do with a seismic force.
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,"He's right, Captain."
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,There's nothing there.
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,"Yes, sir."
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,"No, sir."
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,And I haven't seen any evidence that there ever has been any rainfall.
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,"Yes, sir."
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,Could be.
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,"Yes, sir."
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,I'm not.
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,Geological disturbances don't frighten me.
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,I've come here to study them.
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,My specialty.
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,That's right.
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,How did you know that?
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,"Yes, and we're stranded here."
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,You been talking to my friends?
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,I'm not afraid.
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,"You're, you're the woman on the Enterprise."
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,Lucky D'Amato.
D'AMATO,That Which Survives,I want to have a conference about sharing your food and water.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,Why?
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"What is it, Jim?"
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Jim, did you see what I saw?"
MCCOY,That Which Survives,How could it be gone?
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"What the devil does that mean, Jim?"
MCCOY,That Which Survives,Could it be the Enterprise hit the planet?
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"If the Enterprise has been destroyed, you know how long we can survive."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,Is it possible the vegetation could absorb the water directly from the air?
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Sulu's picked up an organism that's almost a virus, like a a plant parasite."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,It's the nearest biological form of life I can find.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,McCoy to Kirk.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Jim, I just got a life form reading of tremendous intensity."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,Suddenly it was just there.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,Just that.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"All levels were normal, then I get this biological surge of life form registering."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"No, now it's gone."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,Yes.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,Zero eight three.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,I'll be right there.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Jim, every cell in his body's been disrupted."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Jim, what are you doing?"
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Whatever it is, it has a mighty high melting point."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"This whole planet must be made up of this substance, covered over by top soil."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Well, I guess a tomb of rocks is the best we can provide for D'Amato."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,I wonder what killed him.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,It would be worse if he had company.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,I'm not joking.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Until we know what killed him, none of us are safe."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,But our instruments recorded that.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,They were life forms.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,They registered as life forms.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Captain, it doesn't make sense."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"In fact, nothing about this planet makes sense."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,Are you suggesting this might be an artificial planet?
MCCOY,That Which Survives,While it lasts.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Well, all I know is she almost made a ghost out of Sulu."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"His shoulder, where she touched it, every cell's been disrupted."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,Exploded from within.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"If she'd really gotten a good grip on him, Jim."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,There's a layer of necrotic tissue a few cells thick.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,A normal wound would heal quickly.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Jim, what kind of power must she have?"
MCCOY,That Which Survives,Yes.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,Why didn't she kill you?
MCCOY,That Which Survives,He's in fair shape.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Keep behind us, Jim."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Captain, I'm getting no life form register."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,That would give a mechanical reading.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,I'm getting nothing.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,She's not registering.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"Is the power level still holding, Jim?"
MCCOY,That Which Survives,You think we're being invited in?
MCCOY,That Which Survives,We've been led here.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,Why?
MCCOY,That Which Survives,Watch out!
MCCOY,That Which Survives,The women match our chromosome patterns after they touch us.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,The previous ships probably spread the disease all through their people.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,The supply ship that she was waiting for never came.
MCCOY,That Which Survives,"All these thousands of years, she's been waiting to greet people who were dead."
MCCOY,That Which Survives,And beautiful.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Wait!
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,You must not go!
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Do not be afraid.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I know.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"You are Lieutenant D'Amato, Senior Geologist."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,From the spaceship Enterprise.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Do not be afraid.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"I am for you, Lieutenant D'Amato."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I am only for D'Amato.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Do not call the others.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Please.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,My name is not important.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"Yours is Watkins, John B."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Engineer Grade four.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Show me this unit.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I wish to learn.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Not correct.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"That is the emergency overload bypass, which engages almost instantaneously."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"A wise precaution, considering it takes the antimatter longer to explode once the magnetic flow fails."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"I am for you, Mister Watkins."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I am unarmed.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,That is not important.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,You are Lieutenant Sulu.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,You were born on the planet Earth.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,You're helmsman for the Enterprise.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I am from here.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,You do not understand.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I have come for you.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I want to touch you.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I am for him.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I am for Lieutenant Sulu.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I am for Lieutenant Sulu.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"Please, I must touch him."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I don't want to destroy.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I don't want to.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Only Sulu.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I mean you no harm.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"Please, I must touch him."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I am for Lieutenant Sulu.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"For you, James T. Kirk."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Commander of the Enterprise.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,For defence.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"You are Captain James T. Kirk, commander of the Enterprise."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,You are an invader.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"I am Losira, Commander."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Of this station.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Feel?
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Killing is wrong.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,You must not penetrate this station.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"Please, I must touch you."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,No.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I am sent.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,We defend this place.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,They are no more.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I am for James T. Kirk.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Please.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I must touch you.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I beg it.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,It is my existence.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"But you are my match, James Kirk."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I must touch you.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"Then I will live as one, even to the structure of your cells, the arrangement of chromosomes."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"My fellow Kalandans, welcome."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,A disease has destroyed us.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Beware of it.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"After your long journey, I'm sorry to give you only a recorded welcome, but we who have guarded the outpost for you will be dead by the time you take possession of this planet."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I am the last of our advanced force left alive.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,Too late the physicians discovered the cause of this sickness that kills us.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"In creating this planet, we have accidentally produced a deadly organism."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"I have awaited the regular supply ship from home for medical assistance, but I doubt now whether it will arrive in time."
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,I will set the outpost controls on automatic.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,The computer will selectively defend against all life forms but our own.
LOSIRA,That Which Survives,"My fellow Kalandans, I, Losira, wish you well."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,(a woman in yellow uniform) Mister Spock.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,The planet's gone!
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"No debris of any kind, sir."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,I've made two full scans.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"If the planet had broken up, there'd be some sign."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"But what bothers me is the stars, Mister Spock."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Yes, sir."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,They're wrong.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Yes, Mister Spock."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,Look.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,Now here's a replay of the star pattern just before the explosion.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,It doesn't make any sense.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,But somehow I'd say that in a flash we've been knocked one thousand light years away from where we were.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Already plotted and laid in, sir."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"We're holding warp eight point four, sir."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"If we can maintain it, our estimated time of arrival is eleven and one half solar hours."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Mister Spock, speed is increased to warp eight point eight."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Aye, sir."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,Warp seven.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Mister Spock, our speed has increased to warp eight point nine and still climbing."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Mister Spock, we're at warp eleven point two and accelerating."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Aye, sir."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,I'll jettison the pod at the first sign of trouble.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Yes, sir."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,Warp eleven point nine.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,Fifty seven seconds to go.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Warp thirteen point two, sir."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Twenty seconds, Mister Spock."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,Nine seconds.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Eight seconds, seven seconds"
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Six seconds, five seconds, four seconds, three seconds, two seconds."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,One.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,"Mister Spock, now."
RAHDA,That Which Survives,Warp fourteen point one.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,Warp fourteen.
RAHDA,That Which Survives,Warp thirteen point nine and dropping.
SULU,That Which Survives,What kind of earthquakes do they have in this place?
SULU,That Which Survives,It's gone!
SULU,That Which Survives,"The Enterprise, it's gone!"
SULU,That Which Survives,The Enterprise must have blown up.
SULU,That Which Survives,"That would explain the high radiation readings, wouldn't it, Captain?"
SULU,That Which Survives,If the matter - antimatter engines
SULU,That Which Survives,Once in Siberia there was a meteor so great that it flattened whole forests and was felt as far away as
SULU,That Which Survives,"Aye, sir."
SULU,That Which Survives,"Yes, Captain."
SULU,That Which Survives,All vegetation is inedible.
SULU,That Which Survives,Poison to us.
SULU,That Which Survives,"Aye, sir."
SULU,That Which Survives,Sulu to Captain.
SULU,That Which Survives,"Captain, I was making a standard magnetic sweep."
SULU,That Which Survives,"From zero, I suddenly got a reading that was off the scale."
SULU,That Which Survives,"Then, a reverse of polarity and now I get nothing."
SULU,That Which Survives,I've never seen anything like this reading.
SULU,That Which Survives,Like a door opened and then closed again.
SULU,That Which Survives,Poor D'Amato.
SULU,That Which Survives,What a terrible way to die.
SULU,That Which Survives,That's the same red rock.
SULU,That Which Survives,"Yes, sir."
SULU,That Which Survives,It looks so lonely there.
SULU,That Which Survives,"Doctor, how can you joke about it?"
SULU,That Which Survives,"You remember on Janus Six, the silicon creatures"
SULU,That Which Survives,Beings intelligent enough to have destroyed the Enterprise?
SULU,That Which Survives,The basic substance of this planet is an alloy of diburnium-osmium.
SULU,That Which Survives,It couldn't have evolved naturally.
SULU,That Which Survives,"But Captain, where are the people who made it?"
SULU,That Which Survives,Why can't we see them?
SULU,That Which Survives,"I'll take the first watch, sir."
SULU,That Which Survives,"Aye, sir."
SULU,That Which Survives,Who are you?
SULU,That Which Survives,How do you know this?
SULU,That Which Survives,Where did you get this information?
SULU,That Which Survives,Are you from this planet?
SULU,That Which Survives,Then the planet is hollow.
SULU,That Which Survives,Who killed Lieutenant D'Amato?
SULU,That Which Survives,All right.
SULU,That Which Survives,The captain will want to talk to you.
SULU,That Which Survives,That way.
SULU,That Which Survives,Move!
SULU,That Which Survives,What do you want?
SULU,That Which Survives,You were on the Enterprise.
SULU,That Which Survives,Keep back!
SULU,That Which Survives,Stop or I'll shoot!
SULU,That Which Survives,I don't want to have to kill a woman.
SULU,That Which Survives,Captain Kirk!
SULU,That Which Survives,Captain Kirk!
SULU,That Which Survives,"Don't let her touch you, Captain!"
SULU,That Which Survives,That's how D'Amato died.
SULU,That Which Survives,Phasers won't stop her.
SULU,That Which Survives,"How can such people be, Captain?"
SULU,That Which Survives,"Such evil and she's so, so beautiful."
SULU,That Which Survives,She just touched me.
SULU,That Which Survives,How could it happen so fast?
SULU,That Which Survives,"Captain, I'm happy the way it turned out."
SULU,That Which Survives,"I feel fine, Captain."
SULU,That Which Survives,"But Captain, how does she know about us?"
SULU,That Which Survives,Does she read our minds?
SULU,That Which Survives,(there's a whining sound) Phaser on overload!
SULU,That Which Survives,"Captain, I'm getting that strange magnetic sweep again, from zero to off the scale."
SULU,That Which Survives,She must be somewhere.
SULU,That Which Survives,"I'd rather be on the Enterprise, sir."
SULU,That Which Survives,It's a very painful affair.
SULU,That Which Survives,I can tell you.
SULU,That Which Survives,"Captain, we can no longer protect each other."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Engineering, no damage."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,All power levels normal.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,But that's not possible.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Nothing can do that.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"The point is, it shouldn't have hurled us anywhere."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Why, it should have destroyed us immediately, vaporised us."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"What you're saying is that the planet didn't blow up, and the captain and the others, they're still alive!"
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,But even at that it'll take a while to get there.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,And maybe a wee bit more.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I'll sit on the warp engines myself and nurse them.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Scott to Bridge.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Scott to Bridge.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Mister Spock, the ship feels wrong."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I know it doesn't make sense.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Instrumentation reads correct, but the feel is wrong."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,It's something I can't quite put into words.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Watkins, check the bypass valve on the matter/antimatter reaction chamber."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Make sure it's not overheating.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"I didn't ask you to check the board, lad."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Oh, you poor lad."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Scott to bridge.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Scott to bridge.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"My assistant, Watkins, is dead."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"I didn't see it happen, but his last words were a warning cry about some strange woman."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,You mean that one of the people who threw us a thousand light years away from that planet is on board and killing our people?
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Then you're right, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Watkins must've been murdered.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I sent him in to check the matter-antimatter reactor.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,There are no exposed circuits there.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,It couldn't have been anything he touched.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Bridge to Engineering.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Scotty here.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I see it.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,It's a power surge.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I'm working on it.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Reduce speed until I locate the trouble.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Aye, Mister Spock, and I found out why."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,The emergency bypass control of the matter-antimatter integrator is fused.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,It's completely useless.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,The engines are running wild.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,There's no way to get at them.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,We should reach maximum overload in about fifteen minutes.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Those few seconds will not make any difference, Mister Spock, because you and I and the rest of the crew will no longer be here to bandy it back and forth."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,This thing is going to blow up
SCOTT,That Which Survives,And there's nothing in the universe can stop it.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,It's useless.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,And there's no question it's deliberate.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Aye, and a thorough job."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,The system's foolproof.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Whoever murdered Watkins sabotaged this.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,That's what worries me.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Well, it's fused, all right, but it would take all the power of our main phaser banks to do it."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I find nothing interesting in the fact that we're about to blow up.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Whatever did this is still aboard this ship.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I fail to understand why you cancelled the security alert.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Aye.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"There's a service crawlway, but it's not meant to be used while the integrator operates."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,What with?
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Bare hands?
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Any matter that comes in contact with antimatter triggers the explosion.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,And I'm not even sure a man can live in the crawlway in the energy stream of the magnetic field that bottles up the antimatter.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"You'll be killed, man!"
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Aye.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,You're right.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,What have we got to lose?
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"But I'll do it, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I know every millimetre of that system.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I'll do whatever has to be done.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Aye.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,It was an emotional statement.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I don't expect you to understand it.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Mister Spock, we don't have time for that."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"All right, lads."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Get the crawlway door open.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Hand me the tools.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Communicator.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,All right.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Head first.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I hope Mister Spock knows what he's doing.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Scott to Bridge.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"I've sealed off the aft end of the service crawlway, and I've positioned explosive separator charges to blast me clear of the ship if I rupture the magnetic bottle."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I'm so close to the flow now it feels like ants crawling all over my body.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I heard that.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,The ship's not structured to take that speed for any length of time.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"All right, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I'm starting to open the access panel now.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Access to the flow itself.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"If the magnetic flow jumps, you must jettison me."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,The safety control
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Will not hold more than two seconds if I rupture the field.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"I've removed the access plate, and I've got static electric charges dancing on the instruments."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Looks like an aurora borealis in there.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,It's hard to see.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,There's so much disturbance that any attempt to get at the flow would rupture the magnetic field.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I know what time it is.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I don't need a blooming' cuckoo clock.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Mister Spock.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I'm going to try to cut through the magnetic flow.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"But if the probe doesn't precisely match the magnetic flow, there'll be an explosion."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Starting right now.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Reverse polarity?
SCOTT,That Which Survives,That'll take some doing.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,What purpose could it
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I have no time for theory.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I just hope you're right.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I'm doing the best I can!
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Wait!
SCOTT,That Which Survives,It's stuck!
SCOTT,That Which Survives,It's stuck!
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Push the button!
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Don't be a fool!
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Push the button!
SCOTT,That Which Survives,It's your last chance!
SCOTT,That Which Survives,"Don't be sentimental, push it."
SCOTT,That Which Survives,I'm going to die anyway.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,It's loose!
SCOTT,That Which Survives,But there's no time.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Push the button!
SCOTT,That Which Survives,You might at least say thank you.
SCOTT,That Which Survives,Never mind.
M'BENGA,That Which Survives,"Sickbay, Doctor M'Benga."
M'BENGA,That Which Survives,We're not sure.
M'BENGA,That Which Survives,Doctor Sanchez is conducting an autopsy right now.
M'BENGA,That Which Survives,Sickbay to Mister Spock.
M'BENGA,That Which Survives,You asked for an autopsy report.
M'BENGA,That Which Survives,"It's only preliminary, but the cause of death seems to have been cellular disruption."
M'BENGA,That Which Survives,It's as though every cell in the body had been individually blasted from inside.
M'BENGA,That Which Survives,"Doctor Sanchez has ruled that possibility out, sir."
M'BENGA,That Which Survives,"Yes, we have, Mister Spock."
M'BENGA,That Which Survives,"Well, the pattern of cellular disruption was the same, but as to the cause, well your guess is as good as mine."
WATKINS,That Which Survives,"But, Mister Scott, the board shows correct."
WATKINS,That Which Survives,"Yes, sir."
WATKINS,That Which Survives,Who are you?
WATKINS,That Which Survives,You know all about me.
WATKINS,That Which Survives,I've never seen you before.
WATKINS,That Which Survives,This is the matter-antimatter integrator control.
WATKINS,That Which Survives,That's the cut off switch.
WATKINS,That Which Survives,"Mister Scott, there's a strange woman who knows the entire plan of the Enterprise."
COMPUTER,That Which Survives,Working.
COMPUTER,That Which Survives,Unable to comply.
COMPUTER,That Which Survives,Comparison co-ordinates too complex for immediate readout.
COMPUTER,That Which Survives,Will advise upon completion.
COMPUTER,That Which Survives,Comparison analysis complete.
COMPUTER,That Which Survives,Transporter factor M7 reassembled outphase point zero zero zero nine.
COMPUTER,That Which Survives,"Affirmative, if M7 factor maintained."

That Be Your Last Battlefield",I told you where you were going.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I allowed your fellow countryman
here simply as a courtesy."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","It's now very clear you know each other extremely well,
gentlemen."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","The only service this ship can offer is to bring you
together."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",It is not a battlefield.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I'll tell you once more.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","For you, this ship is a prison."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Commissioner, Cheron is not a member of the Federation."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","No
treaties have ever been signed."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Your demand for possession of this
prisoner cannot be honoured."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","There are no extradition procedures to
allow it."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Is that clear, Commissioner Bele?"
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",How do you mean?
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I cannot take sides.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Impossible.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I have a mission to accomplish.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","There's a planet to
be decontaminated."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Millions of lives are at stake.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Once that has been
completed, I'll return to Starbase Four and turn you both over to the
authorities."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You can make your case to them.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Commissioner, as a visiting dignitary from a far planet, I offer
you every hospitality aboard this ship."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Choose any other course,"
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Yes, I am."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I think we can consider your problem settled.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","At least
for the present."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I have ordered guest quarters for you on deck six.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","And I suggest you get a great deal of rest, especially your vocal
chords."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","It seems you'll have a double opportunity to practise your
oratory on Starbase Four."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Well, get back on course."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I'll be right there.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Have you located the malfunction?
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Explanation, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Kirk to engineering.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Scotty, we're suddenly off course."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Check our manoeuvering
controls."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Switch to auxiliary.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Stand by for check.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Scotty, we're still off course."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Speed, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",And new course?
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Lieutenant Uhura, put the ship on Red Alert."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","All hands, this is
the captain."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",The ship is on Red Alert.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Repeat, the ship is on Red Alert."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","There
has been an unidentified malfunction in the ship's directional control."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Repeat, the ship is off course and out
of our control."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Our new heading, Mister Chekov?"
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Spock?
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You're two of a kind.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Security, put them both in the brig."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Phasers on stun.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Fire.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",(no effect)
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",This ship is going to Ariannus.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",We are going to Ariannus.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","The lives of a billion people make no
other choice possible."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Bele, I am captain of this ship, and it will follow whatever
course I set for it, or I will order its destruction."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I will destroy it.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Lieutenant Uhura, tie in the bridge to the master computer."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Computer, destruct sequence."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Are you ready to copy?
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Prepare to verify destruct sequence code one.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Computer, this is
Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Destruct sequence one, code one, one A."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Mister Spock.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Mister Scott.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Mister Spock, has the ship returned to the course set for it by
my orders?"
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Computer, this is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Begin
thirty second countdown."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Code zero, zero, zero, destruct zero."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Let's see you prevent the computer from fulfilling my commands.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","From five to zero, no command in the universe can prevent the
computer from fulfilling its destruct orders."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You can use your will to drag this ship to Cheron.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","But I command
the computer."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Mine is the final command.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Computer.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Code
one, two, three continuity."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Abort destruct order.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Repeat code one, two,
three continuity."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Abort destruct order.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Mister Spock, is this ship headed for Ariannus?"
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","We're waiting for you to fulfil your commitment, Commissioner."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I make no deals for control of this ship, sir."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Ship's course?
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Speed, Scotty?"
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Good.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Lieutenant Uhura, cancel Red Alert."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Let me reaffirm my position, gentlemen."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I could put you in the
brig for what you have done, but I won't do it
because you are new to this part of the galaxy, which is governed by
the United Federation of Planets."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","We live in peace with full exercise
of individual rights."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","The need to resort to violence and force has long
since passed, and it will not be tolerated aboard this ship."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You are
free to move about the ship."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I hope that you'll take the opportunity to
know more about the Federation through its best representatives, my
crew."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",But let me make it clear.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I will stand for no interference with
the function of this ship."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","All hands, return to normal routine."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain
out."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","We try, sir."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",That's enough for today.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Those two are beginning to affect you.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I expect the answer is already on its way.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Let's do that.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","No, Commissioner."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","The one thing we're agreed upon is that Lokai
took a shuttlecraft."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Excuse me.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Yes, read it."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",That's enough.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Thank you.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Now, wait a minute, Commissioner,"
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I can assure you, Commissioner, that our minds will not be
twisted, not by Lokai, nor by you."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You're black on one side and white on the other.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I fail to see the significant difference.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Let Lokai state his grievances.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Hear him, listen to him."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Maybe he
can change."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Maybe he wants to change his image.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","There must have been a time, long ago no doubt, when that was
true."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Excuse me.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Very good.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Commence decontamination procedures when ready.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Advise
when complete."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Good.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Repeat procedure for maximum effect.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Kirk here.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Very good.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",We'll be right up.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Set directional controls for Starbase Four.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Kirk out.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Will you join us on the bridge?
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Can you determine which ones?
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","At the moment, I seem to have no choice."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","After so many years of leading the fight, you seem very much
alive."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Bele, you keep this up, and you'll never get to Cheron with your
prisoner."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",The rest of this ship will be irreparably damaged.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","This will
be your final battlefield."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Your fifty thousand years of pursuit will
have been wasted."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","And you, Lokai, will die here in space."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You'll inspire no more
disciples."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Your cause will be ended.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You've made your point.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I understand.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Will you return the Enterprise to my control?
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Scotty, have repairs on directional control been completed?"
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Check controls and co-ordinates.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Is it within visual range?
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Chekov, put it on the screen."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Extreme magnification.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","What are you
picking up?"
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You mean, all the people are dead?"
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Yes, Commissioner, all of them."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Stop it!
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",What's the matter with you two?
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Didn't you hear Spock?
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Your planet is dead!
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",There's nobody alive on Cheron because of hate.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",The cause you fought about no longer exists.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Give yourselves time to
breathe."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Give up your hate.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You're welcome to live with us.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Listen to
me."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You both must end up dead if you don't stop hating.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Bele.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",The chase is finished.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Bele.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","No, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Where can they run?
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Spock, anyone in the transporter room?"
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",There's nobody there to try him.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",His judges are all dead.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Of course.
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","No, but that's all they have left."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Warp factor two, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Set course for Starbase Four.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","At present speed, our eta is three hours, four minutes, sir."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I think that may be a Starfleet shuttlecraft.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, contact with alien ship, sir."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I verify, sir, it's out there."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","No malfunction, sir."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",The reading persists.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",It's headed straight for us!
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","It shifts with us, sir."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",And we're pushing to the limit!
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",We're on collision course.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Chekov to Captain Kirk.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Chekov to Captain Kirk.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Urgent.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, we're off course."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","That's just it, sir."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","The ship's taken a new heading all by
itself."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",We're moving at warp eight.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",four oh three mark seven.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Straight for the Coal Sack if there
is no letup."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Four oh three mark seven.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","After all, we are only human."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",There was persecution on Earth once.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I remember reading about
it in my history class."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Ready, sir."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Tanks positioned.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Ready, sir."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I don't rightly know, Mister Spock."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I was trying to programme
for Starbase Four as ordered."
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I can't get a response.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",We are not killers.
CHEKOV,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Locking onto co-ordinates.
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Aye, Captain."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","No response, sir."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Hailing on all frequencies.
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Lieutenant Uhura here.
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, I've tried all hailing frequencies."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Negative, sir."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Aye, sir."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Uhura to Captain Kirk.
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I have a communication from Starfleet Command, sir."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Starfleet Command extends greetings to
Commissioner Bele of the planet Cheron."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","His urgent request to be
transported to his planet with the man he claims prisoner has been
taken under consideration."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","It is with great regret that we cannot
honour that request."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Intergalactic treaty clearly specifies that no
being can be extradited without due process."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","In view of the
circumstances, we have no doubt that after a hearing at Starbase,
Commissioner Bele will be permitted to retain his prisoner and be
provided transportation"
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Ready, Mister Scott."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Ariannus says go ahead.
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","It just seemed to go dead, sir."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Shall I alert security, sir?"
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, someone has activated the transporter mechanism."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, the transporter mechanism has been activated again."
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",It doesn't make any sense.
UHURA,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Do you suppose that's all they ever had, sir?"
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","None, sir."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",All tanks are being positioned.
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Scott here.
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Hold.
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, no malfunction
indicated."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Out.
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",(presses a lot of buttons.)
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Engineer to bridge.
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","On auxiliary, sir."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I'll be right up.
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, we are now at warp ten and the speed is increasing!"
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","This is Lieutenant Commander Scott, chief engineering officer of
the USS Enterprise."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Destruct sequence number three, code one B, two B,
three."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","And at warp ten, we're going now here mighty fast."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Warp six and smoothly operating, sir."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Disgusting is what I call them.
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Mister Spock, the word disgusting describes exactly what I feel
about those two."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","We're orbiting Ariannus, sir."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","At once, sir."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Scott out.
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Ready for decontamination procedure.
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Mister Sulu, lock into co-ordinates requested by Ariannus."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Mister Chekov, position tanks for spray release."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Lieutenant Uhura, advise Ariannus the mission is to begin on
signal."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",All ground precautions must be ready.
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Well, let 'er rip."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Scott to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","First run complete, sir."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Ready to repeat decontamination
procedure."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Mister Sulu?
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","We're completing the final orbit of Ariannus, sir."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I'm awaiting
instructions to set course for the next destination."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Re-routed.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, sensors indicate a space vehicle of some sort ahead."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Coming into range now, sir."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",It's following a very erratic course.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","It looks like the one reported stolen from Starbase Four two
weeks ago."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Tractor beams activated.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","We have it, sir."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Aye, sir."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Hangar doors open and clearing for entrance of shuttlecraft.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Shuttlecraft approaching hangar deck.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Bridge to Captain Kirk.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Hangar doors closed, and hangar deck is pressurising."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Automatic, sir."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",It's out of control or a suicide mission.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Brace yourself for collision.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Brace yourself.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","No, sir."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",The ship is unresponsive.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","We're moving away from
Ariannus."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I can't understand it.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I simply have no control.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","No one knows how he'll react under pressure, Lokai."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Yes, but it happened way back in the twentieth century."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","There's
no such primitive thinking today."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Ready here.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Locked in, sir."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Ready here.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Controls operating.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",The Enterprise is responding as always.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, it's beautiful."
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",But their planet's dead.
SULU,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Does it matter now which one's right?
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","That is exactly what it is, Mister Chekov."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, there is one living creature aboard."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Humanoid.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","He is
either injured or ill. His craft shows internal atmospheric leakage."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",The creature may be suffocating.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You are certain, Doctor, that this pigmentation is the natural
condition of this individual?"
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","There is no theory, Captain, from the basic work of Mendel to
recent nucleotide studies, which would explain our captive."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","All
gradations of colour from black to brown, to yellow to white are
genetically predictable."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","We must therefore conclude that this alien is
that often unaccountable rarity, a mutation, one of a kind."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Yet you are pumping him full of your noxious potions as if he
were a human."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","With your permission, Captain, I shall do some further research
and join you on the bridge."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","There is a vessel out there, Captain."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Negative.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",This would not be a Romulan vessel.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","It is totally
alien in configuration."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Motive power unknown.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Small size of the craft
indicates a rapid scout vessel, one or two-man crew."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Nothing identifiable.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","The craft appears to be built for speed
rather than combat."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",None.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Completely elusive.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","In fact, it's invisible."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",There is no sensor failure.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",The readings persist.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",It just disintegrated.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","It is gone now, Captain, but it seems to have deposited an alien
presence."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",A most unique craft.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Pity it couldn't be salvaged for our study.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Elusive, Captain."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I am investigating.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Confirmed, Captain."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Holding pattern.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Co-ordinates now indicate
we are charting course to (pause) Captain, Cheron lies between four oh
three mark seven and mark nine."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, course is now clearly straight for Cheron, despite all
efforts to direct us to Ariannus."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","This is Commander Spock, science officer."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Destruct sequence
number two, code one, one A, two B."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",We are still headed directly for Cheron.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","The Enterprise is now moving in a circular
course."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Enterprise is now on course to Ariannus, Captain."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Two irrevocably hostile humanoids.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",That description is not scientifically accurate.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Commissioner, Starfleet Command may not arrive at the solution
you anticipate."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","There is the matter of the shuttlecraft which Lokai
appropriated."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","The interrogation of that matter may be of paramount
importance to Starfleet."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",We do not know that Lokai has done that.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","The obvious visual evidence, Commissioner, is that he is of the
same breed as yourself."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Commissioner, perhaps the experience of my own planet Vulcan may
set an example of some value to you."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Vulcan was in danger of being
destroyed by the same conditions and characteristics which threaten to
destroy Cheron."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","We were once a people like yourselves, wildly
emotional, often committed to irrationally opposing points of view,
leading, of course, to death and destruction."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Only the discipline of
logic saved my planet from extinction."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Change is the essential process of all existence.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","For instance,
the people of Cheron must have once been mono-coloured."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","The actual theory is that all life-forms evolved from the lower
levels to the more advanced stages."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Trouble, Mister Chekov?"
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, some of the memory banks of the computer are burned
out."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I doubt that the same can be said for many of his followers.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, we are within scanning range of Cheron."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Coming within visual range now, Captain."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Several large cities, uninhabited."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Extensive traffic systems,
barren of traffic."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Lower animal sand vegetation encroaching on the
cities."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","No sapient life-forms registering at all, Captain."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","There is no
evidence of natural disaster, yet there are vast numbers of unburied
corpses in all cities."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","All dead, Captain."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",They have annihilated each other totally.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","None at all, sir."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Where can he go?
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, I have located them on ship's sensors."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Bele is chasing
Lokai on deck three."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Bele is passing recreation room three, approaching
the crewmen's lounge."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Lokai is running past the crewmen's lounge.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Lokai
has just arrived on deck five."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Passing recreation room three.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Transporter room is clear.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","However, there is
a life-form materialising on the planet."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",It is Lokai.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","He is back on
Cheron."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","It is Bele, Captain."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","And another life-form has appeared on
Cheron."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","To expect sense from two mentalities of such extreme viewpoints
is not logical."
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Not to Lokai and Bele.
SPOCK,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",All that matters to them is their hate.
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","That's what I've recorded, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Well, I can't give you any specific circumstance that will
explain him."
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Yes, I would agree."
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",That's the case here.
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Well, I can't give you one, Jim."
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I've never worked on anyone
like him or anything like him."
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","When in doubt, the book prevails, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I've run tests.
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Blood is blood, even when it's green like yours."
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",The organs are there.
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","They're rearranged to a degree, plus a few I've
never seen before."
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Now, I've enriched the oxygen content of his blood
and pumped in a strong stimulant."
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","And I must say his recuperative
powers appear to be excellent."
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Well, touch and go there for a minute, but you're out of danger
now."
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Well, however we view him, Captain, he's certainly no ordinary
specimen."
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Lokai, I don't know what's normal for you exactly, but if I
had your readings, I'd be the most incredible physical specimen of all
time."
MCCOY,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Unless we get more information from him, it'll have to serve."
CHAPEL,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","He's coming around, Doctor."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I've heard of it.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",It's in the United Fleet of Planets?
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",It was?
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I am not a thief.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You're being very loose with your accusations and drawing
conclusions without any facts."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I do not make off with things.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","My need gave me the right to use
the ship."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Mark the word, sir, the use of it."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I'm grateful for your rescue.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",My name is Lokai.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",From the planet Cheron.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",The charge is trifling.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I would've returned the ship as soon as
I"
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You monotone humans are all alike.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","First you condemn and then
attack."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I will answer no more questions.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I'm very tired.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I insist, I'm extremely tired."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Made so by your vindictive
cross-examinations."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I will answer no more questions.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I will not return to Cheron with him, to a land of murdering
oppressors!"
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Benefactors?
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",He's a liar.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","He raided our homes, tore us from our
families, herded us together like cattle and then sold us as slaves!"
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Yes, just education enough to serve the master race."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Why should a slave show mercy to the enslaver?
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Freed?
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Were we free to be men?
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Free to be husbands and fathers?
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Free to live our lives in equality and dignity?
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I tried to break the chains of a hundred million people.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","My only
crime is that I failed."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",To that I do plead guilty.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Not in a day.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","And not in ten times ten thousand years by your
thinking."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","To you, we are a loathsome breed who will never be ready."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Genocide for my people is the plan for your utopia.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I know you and all those with whom you're plotting to take power
permanently."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","When I return to Cheron, you will understand what power
is."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I will have armies of followers.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, I led revolutionaries, not criminals."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I demand
political asylum."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",This ship is a sanctuary.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I will not return to Cheron.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, you must guarantee me
sanctuary."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Stop him.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",My cause is just.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You must help me.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",All of you must help me.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Kill him.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Kill him!
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","What a fool I am, expecting help from someone like you."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I warned you of his treachery.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Kill him!
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You speak very well, Captain."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Your words promise justice for
all."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Yes, well, I have learned to wait for actions."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","After Ariannus,
what is justice?"
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I shall wait to see it dispensed.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","And I know from my actions you must all think me a volcanic
hothead, erupting lava from my nostrils at danger signals that are only
figments of my imagination."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","But believe me, my friends, there can be no
moment when I can have my guard down where such as Bele is present."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","So
what happens?"
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I act the madman out of the anger and frustration he
forces upon me, and thereby prove his point that I am a madman."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Ah, Mister Chekov, therein lies my lack of ability to alert you
and your captain to the real threat of someone like Bele."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You see, you
are from the planet Earth."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",There is no persecution on your planet.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","How
can you understand my fear,
my apprehension, my degradation, my suffering?"
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You have read about it in history, I see."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","How can I make your
flesh know how it feels to see all those who are like you, and only
because they are like you, despised, slaughtered, and even worse,
denied the simplest bit of decency that is a living being's right?"
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Do
you know what it would be like to be dragged out of your hovel into a
war on another planet?"
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","A battle that will serve your oppressor and
bring death to you and your brothers?"
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",So this is justice after Ariannus!
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You have signed my death
warrant."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I warned you what to expect.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Will you continue to let this
mockery of justice go on?"
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","If you are partisans of justice, prove it!"
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Kill him!
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","What do you do, carry justice on your tongues?"
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You will beg for
it, but you won't fight or die for it."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You useless pieces of bland flesh.
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I'll take you with me, you
half-black."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Remember, Captain, political sanctuary is my right."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I am your
prisoner."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Honour that right, or the fight will go on and your ship will
burn up."
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",No one alive?
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Your genocidal maniacs did this!
LOKAI,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You're an idealistic dreamer.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Right here, Captain."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I am Bele.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Forgive my unorthodox arrival.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",It served me long and durably.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Unfortunately, the strain of
arduous pursuit has exceeded even its advanced qualities."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I was just
able to complete this trip and disembark in time, or I would have
disintegrated in space with it."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Yes.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","It was sheathed in special materials that rendered it
invisible."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You bear precious cargo, Lokai."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","He has taken refuge aboard this
ship."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I am here to claim him.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","My apologies, Captain."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I overstepped my powers.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Claim is
undoubtedly an unfortunate word."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I am chief officer of the Commission on Political Traitors.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Lokai
was tried and convicted of treason, but had escaped."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","May I see him,
please?"
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","With your permission, Captain."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Well, Lokai, it's a pleasure to see you
again."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","This time I'm sure our joining will be of a more permanent
nature."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, you are to be congratulated."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Never before has Lokai been
rendered so quiescent."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","And you see how this killer repays you, as he repays all his
benefactors."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","They were savages, Captain."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","We took them into our hearts, our
homes."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",We educated them.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You were the product of our love!
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",And you repaid us with murder.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Slaves?
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",That was changed thousands of years ago.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You were freed.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Yes, you were free, if you knew how to use your freedom."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You were
free enough to slaughter and to burn all the things that had been
built!"
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",There is an order in things.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",He asked for utopia in a day.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","It
can't be done."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You insane, you filthy little plotter of ruin."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You vicious
subverter of every decent thought."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Oh, you're coming back to pay for
your crimes!"
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, it is imperative that you return Lokai to Cheron for
judgment."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, I hope you will be sensible."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Co-operation.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Since I am without a vessel to return to Cheron, I insist that
you take us there immediately."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I am sorry, Captain."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","That will not be satisfactory, not at all
satisfactory."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You're the captain.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",We're on the way to Cheron.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, this ship is now under my
direction."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","For fifty thousand of your terrestrial years,
I have been pursuing Lokai through the galaxy."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I have not travelled
this far, this long, only to give him up."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","This ship goes where my will
drives it."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",He cannot help you now.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You are lost, Lokai."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You're on the way to
judgment, to final punishment."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You evil mound of filth.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Not this time.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Oh, the old cry."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Pity me, pity me."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Everywhere he's gone, he's
been helped to escape."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","On every planet he's found fools who bleed for
him and shed tears for the oppressed one."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","But there is no escape for
you on this ship."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",This is your last sanctuary.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",And we are both going to Cheron.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You cannot change the course of
this ship any more than you can change me."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","This ship goes where I want
it to go."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Your phasers are ineffective against our shields.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You are
helpless, Captain."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","No, this ship is going to Cheron."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I will let nothing interfere.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You are being obtuse, Captain."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I am permitting no choice.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","My will
now controls this, and nothing can break it."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You're bluffing.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You can no more destroy this ship than I can change colour.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I agree!
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Captain, I am happy to have you complete your mission of mercy to
the planet Ariannus."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","It was madness to interfere with such a worthwhile
endeavour."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","But, if you will, upon completion, please take me and my
traitorous captive to Cheron."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",The ship's course is now in your control.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Putting the matter into the hands of your
Starfleet Command is, of course, the proper procedure."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","How long will it
be before we hear from them, Captain?"
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Well, then, let us drink to their wise solution to our problem."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Gentlemen, we are discussing a question of degree."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Surely,
stealing a shuttlecraft cannot be equated with the importance of
murdering thousands of people."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",One thing we are agreed on is that Lokai is a criminal.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","As always, Lokai has managed to gain allies."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Even if they don't recognise themselves as being such.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Yes, he
will evade, delay, and escape again and in the process put thousands of
innocent beings at each other's throats, getting them to kill and maim
for a cause which they have no stake in, but which he will force them
to violently espouse by twisting their minds with his lies, his
loathsome accusations and his foul threats."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","It is obvious to the most simpleminded that Lokai is of an
inferior breed."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Are you blind, Commander Spock?"
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Well, look at me."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Look at me!
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I am black on the right side.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Lokai is white on the right side.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","All of his people are white on
the right side."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","Commander Spock, I am delighted that Vulcan was saved, but you
cannot expect Lokai and people like him to act with self-discipline any
more than you can expect a planet to stop orbiting its sun."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",He cannot change.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",You mean like both of you?
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","I once heard that on some of your planets people believe they are
descended from apes."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",There is nothing I would like more.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","The directional control and the self-destruct, Captain, are both
burnt out."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",I did it like this.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Now can we go to Cheron without any more discussion?
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You're finished, Lokai!"
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","We've got your kind penned in on Cheron
into little districts, and it's not going to change."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You've combed the
galaxy and come up with nothing but mono-coloured trash, do-gooders and
bleeding hearts."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","You're dead, you half-white!"
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","If you listen to his legalistic trickery, I shall have to destroy
this ship and everybody aboard."
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Why not?
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield","My people, all dead?"
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",Your band of murderers did this.
BELE,"Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield",He must not escape me.

KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Donald, good to see you."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,We'd be delighted.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Why, Donald, are you becoming a pessimist?"
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"When I was a cadet at the Academy, his exploits were required reading."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,He was one of my heroes.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I'd like to see him.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,What is it you want to tell me?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,You're afraid to talk in front of Governor Cory?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Cory?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Garth, do you have to make him suffer like that?"
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I'm sorry.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I should've said Captain Garth.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"I'm sorry, Lord Garth."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Release him.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Are you so afraid of him that you must keep him pinned?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Thank you.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Now what have you done with the medicine?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Destroyed it?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,It was your only hope.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Of course.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,The crew of the Enterprise will also mutiny.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Governor Cory, how do you feel?"
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,How does he manage to change form at will?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,He was such a genius.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,What a waste.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Force field is on.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Good.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Remain here out of sight until I give the order to join me.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Beam me aboard.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I said beam me aboard.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,We have no time for chess problems.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Beam me aboard!
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Just testing.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Be in touch with you later.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,(throws a tantrum) No!
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,No!
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,No!
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,(ends up thumping the floor until he changes beck to Garth.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Thank you for your concern.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"All in all, it's been rather restful."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I'd forgotten.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Where is Mister Spock?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"How are you, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Isn't Governor Cory joining us?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,An oversight?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"In that case, we must decline with thanks."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,You're very persuasive.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Not really.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"All we need is a few seconds, if Scotty has alerted the security detail."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, er, incredible."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Oh, er, thank you."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"That's, er, very magnanimous of you."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,That's very flattering.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"I am primarily an explorer now, Captain Garth."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,And tried to destroy Antos Four.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, you could say, but that would be untrue."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"I agree there was a time when war was necessary, and you were our greatest warrior."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I studied your victory at Axanar when I was a cadet.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,In fact it's still required reading at the Academy.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Very well.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,But my first visit to Axanar was as a new fledged cadet on a peace mission.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"They were humanitarians and statesmen, and they had a dream."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"A dream that became a reality and spread throughout the stars, a dream that made Mister Spock and me brothers."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,No thank you.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I prefer to join Mister Spock.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Occasionally.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I'm sure you're aware that there are an infinite number of countermoves.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I can't for the life of me imagine which one.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Dead I am of no use to you.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, I think it's very good."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I can't.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, I recognise it."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,It's used for rehabilitation purposes.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Stop it!
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,No.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Is this more of Garth's persuasion, Marta?"
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I believe you mean that.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Marta.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Marta, I can help you, but I must get to the Enterprise to do that."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, it is."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"It is if I can get to the control room and remove the force field, then Garth is finished."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,He will lead you to destruction.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,He's already destroyed the medicine that could have helped you.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,But there's more medicine aboard the ship.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Spock?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,How did you manage that?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I'm very glad to see you.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, you presume correctly."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Mister Scott, I want a fully armed security detail beamed down here on the double."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,And have Doctor McCoy prepare additional medicine as quickly as possible.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Very well, Spock."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Scotty, Mister Spock will give the countersign."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,What have you done with Spock?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Where is he?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Captain Garth
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"No, sir."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Captain Garth, Starship fleet Captain."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,That's an honourable title.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, you were."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Yes.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"But you're a sick man now, sir."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,No.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"No, think."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Think back to what you were before the accident that sent you to Antos Four.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Try.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"No, I, I can remember."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"You were the finest student at the Academy, the finest Starship Captain."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"You were the prototype, the model for the rest of us."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,And you bore it well.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"And the disease that changed you, it's not your fault."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"And the terrible things you did since then, not truly responsible."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"No, I'm not."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I want you to find what you once had.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"I want you to go back to the greatness that you've lost, Captain Garth."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"No, sir, listen to me."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,No.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Coronation?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, I agree."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"You'll wear a crown too, I presume?"
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Garth, you have only a handful of men."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"No, I wouldn't enjoy that at all."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Besides, you seem to need me alive."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Listen to me.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,This may be our last chance.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Garth will destroy all of us unless you help me stop him.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"And he's using you, you know that, because he wants the power for himself."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"I brought something that might have cured you, but he destroyed it."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"If I can get a patrol down, they'd bring more of that medicine and"
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"All I can say, Garth, if it happens to me, it happens to you."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"(with chair) I'm your Captain, Spock!"
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Can't you tell?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Shoot!
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Shoot!
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"(on floor) He's right, Spock."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"You must shoot, but shoot both of us."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,It's the only way to ensure the safety of the Enterprise.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Mister Spock.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Captain Garth, I'm James Kirk."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,The starship Enterprise.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, sir, the Enterprise."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I'm the captain.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,(Kirk and Garth shake hands) Can I help?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"No, Captain."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,No.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Mister Spock.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Tell me something.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Why was it so impossible to tell the difference between us?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, and congratulations."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,What took you so long?
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,I see.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,Mister Spock.
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Letting yourself be hit on the head, and I presume you let yourself be hit on the head, is not exactly a method King Solomon would have approved."
KIRK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Mister Scott, ready to beam up."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Governor.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Governor, you indicated one additional inmate since our last visit, making a total of fifteen."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Is that correct?
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,A total of fifteen incurably insane out of billions is not what I would call an excessive figure.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Who is the new inmate?
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"She sounds rational enough, Captain."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Very well indeed, thank you, Captain."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"(muttering) If you could create a diversion, I might be able to find the control room and open the force field."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"I find it mildly interesting and somewhat nostalgic, if I understand the use of that word."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Yes.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,It is somewhat reminiscent of the dances that Vulcan children do in nursery school.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Of course, the children are not so well co-ordinated."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"On what, precisely, is our friendship to be based?"
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Why?
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"How could you, a Starship fleet Captain, believe that a Federation crew would blindly obey your order to destroy the entire Antos race, a people famous for their benevolence and peaceful pursuits?"
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively and with undue emotion.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"However, what he says is logical and I do, in fact, agree with it."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Please forgive me, but exactly where is your fleet?"
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Captain Garth
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,As you wish.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"At any rate, you must be aware of the fact that you are attempting to recreate the disaster which resulted in your becoming an inmate in this place."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,On the contrary.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"You were treated with justice, and with compassion which you failed to show towards any of your intended victims."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Logically, therefore, one must assume"
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,She seems to have worked out an infallible method for assuring permanent male fidelity.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Interesting.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Thank you, Captain."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,(draws a phaser) We're now armed.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,I presume we shall try to reach the control room.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Force field is now off, Captain."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Captain, I suggest you return to the ship at once."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Your safety is vital to the Enterprise.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,I also request permission to remain here in charge of the security team when they beam down.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Mister Scott, the Captain's life is in immediate danger."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Beam him aboard at once.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,The security team will be entrusted to me.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"He's waiting for the proper reply, Captain."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Give him the countersign, Captain."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Queen to queen's level three.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Arranging to beam down a security team.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Are there any objections?
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,What maneuver did we use to defeat the Romulan vessel near Tau Ceti?
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Agreed, Captain."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Captains.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Gentlemen, whichever one of you is Captain Garth must at this moment be expending a great deal of energy to maintain the image of Captain Kirk."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"That energy level cannot be maintained indefinitely, and I have time."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Captain Kirk, I presume."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Queen to king's level one.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"I am Mister Spock, science officer on a Starship."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"It was not impossible, Captain."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Our presence here is proof of that.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"The interval of uncertainty was actually fairly brief, Captain."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,It only seemed long to you.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"I was waiting for a victor in the hand to hand struggle, which I assumed would be Captain Garth."
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,Because of your depleted condition.
SPOCK,Whom Gods Destroy,"Failing a resolution to the struggle, I was forced to use other means to make my determination."
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,"Gentlemen, you don't know what a treat this is for me."
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,It's been too long since I've had company.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,The force field's back in place now.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,"That means you two are trapped here, and I'm not accepting any excuses for your not dining with me."
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,It is.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,"The rehabilitation programme isn't progressing too well, and I have my doubts about the effectiveness of this medicine too."
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,I'm afraid I have.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,Garth.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,"Garth of Izar, a former Starship fleet Captain."
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,Of course.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,"Captain Kirk is pressed for time at the moment, Marta."
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,She's been saying that for days now.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,Our medical staff can't figure out why.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,Here's Garth.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,"He's been unusually disturbed, and we've had to impose additional restraint."
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,"(in cell) Yes, Jim, I'm Cory."
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,It's true.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,He tricked you.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,"Captain Garth, listen to me."
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,All right.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,There is no help for any of us if that madman is in command of the Enterprise.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,"He boasts that he's created the most powerful explosive in the universe, and I believe him."
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,The people of Antos taught him the techniques of cellular metamorphosis to restore the destroyed parts of his body.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,"By himself, he later learned to use the technique to recreate himself into any form he wished."
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,"The first time we knew about it was when a guard, seeing what he thought was me in Garth's cell, released him."
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,"Don't be a fool, Jim."
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,Go along with him.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,It helped many men back to health.
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,Will intramuscular injection be satisfactory?
CORY,Whom Gods Destroy,"How long before it takes effect, Doctor McCoy?"
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,(an Orion woman) Captain!
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,You're making a mistake.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,There's nothing the matter with me!
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Can't you see just by looking at me?
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Can't you tell just by listening?
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,I am rational.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,I can't tell you in front of him.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"He isn't really Governor Cory at all, that's just it."
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"Good bye, darling."
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,I'll miss you.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Why can't I blow off just one of his ears?
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,You're jealous!
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"Am I annoying you, dearest?"
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,He finds me fascinating and you're bothered by it.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Admit it.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"No, you won't, because I am the most beautiful woman on this planet."
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"Well, I'm the most beautiful woman in this galaxy!"
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,I'm beautiful!
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,And I'm intelligent too.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"I write poetry, and I paint marvellous pictures."
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,And I am a wonderful dancer.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,If you like.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, and summer's lease hath all too soon"
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yesterday, as a matter of fact."
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Which does not alter the fact that I wrote it again yesterday!
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"I think it's one of my best poems, don't you?"
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"In the midnight of November, when the dead man's fare is nigh, and the danger in the valley, and the anger in the sky."
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,I wrote that this morning.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Do you like it?
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Tell him what he wants to know and we'll go away together.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,But you must.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,I beg of you.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"No, you mustn't do that!"
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"Please, stop it!"
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Yes.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"Listen to me, my Lord Garth."
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,I can get him to tell me what you want to know.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"Slowly, darling, slowly."
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Rest.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,I told him I'd discover your secret.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,I lied.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,I would have told him anything to save you from that torment.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,I do.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,(kisses him) This is where I've longed to be.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,I think I knew I loved you from the moment I first saw you.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,That's not possible.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Garth is my leader.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"I'll help you, but you must wait."
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"You do see that, don't you?"
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Soon your friend Spock will be here and then
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,At least I've arranged that much.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,A convincing lie told to a guard who finds me desirable.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,Darling.
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,"No, you mustn't stop me."
MARTA,Whom Gods Destroy,He's my lover and I have to kill him.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You said you wanted to see me, Captain."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Well, here I am."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Your Vulcan friend is still alive, Captain."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"My phaser was set to stun, not to kill."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,He'll be quite comfortable.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Almost as comfortable as you and our esteemed governor.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You will address me by my proper title, Kirk."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"I am Lord Garth, formerly of Izar, and I lead the future masters of the universe."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You Earth people are a stiff necked lot, aren't you?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I'm afraid that subjugating you won't be enough.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,You must be confined.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,And all the people of the galaxy who will not bow to my will must be confined or destroyed.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Oh ho!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Our beloved governor has decided to address us, and we have not given him our permission to speak."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,(releasing Cory) I'm afraid of no one.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,You're all powerless against me.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,The medicine?
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,You mean the poison.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I destroyed it.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Silence!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"The chatter of inferior weaklings wearies me, and it's time I took command of the Enterprise."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You'll help me, of course."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,My crew mutinied.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,The first use I will make of the Enterprise is to hunt them down and punish them for that.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,But they won't.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You see, Captain, there's a helpful technique I've mastered."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"We are going to take the Enterprise, do you hear me?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,We are going to take her if I have to shatter every bone in Captain Kirk's body.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Captain?
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Captain Kirk?
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Well, I hope you haven't been too uncomfortable, Captain."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Good.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Still, I've been quite remiss in my duties as your host."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"I did invite you down to dinner, as you may recall."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,But I haven't.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,You and Mister Spock are to be my guests.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Right here.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Marta!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Stop that, Marta."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Mister Spock will think we're lacking in hospitality.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Won't you join us, Captain?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"No, the governor doesn't seem to be on the guest list."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,An intentional one.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,The governor's fasting.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,(draws a weapon) Captain.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Good advice, Governor."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Well, Captain?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You'll find we set a handsome table, and the entertainment is most enjoyable."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, I am."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I certainly am.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Keep your hands off Kirk!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,You treacherous thing!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I am above that sort of thing.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"The Captain is annoyed by your attentions, that's all."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I may have you beaten to death.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You're the only woman on this planet, you stupid cow."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,You're repulsive!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Lies!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,All lies!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,You are the greatest liar I have ever met!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Let me hear one poem you've written.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Gentlemen, courtesy for the performer."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,You wrote that?
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,It was written by an Earth man named Shakespeare a long time ago!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I may kill you with my bare hands!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"(Marta runs to the other men) Actually, Captain, she is a superb dancer."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Marta, my dear, won't you dance for our guests?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,That was not a request.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Marvellous, isn't she, Captain?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"What is your reaction, Mister Spock?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Nostalgic?
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"She's yours if you wish, Captain."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You'll find that I am magnanimous to my friends and merciless to my enemies, and I want you, both of you, to be my friends."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Upon the firmest of foundations, Mister Spock."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Enlightened self interest.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You, Captain, are second only to me as the finest military commander in the galaxy."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,And so have I been.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I have charted more new worlds than any man in history.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Well, I could say because they were actively hostile to the Federation."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Agreed.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Actually they were quite harmless, and they made me whole when I was maimed and dying."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"And in my gratitude, I offered them the galaxy."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"They rejected me, and I condemned them to death."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,That was my only miscalculation.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I had changed.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"I had risen above this decadent weakness which still has you in its command, by the way, Captain."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,My crew had not.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"I couldn't sway them, but my new crew, the men in this room, will obey my orders without question."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Gentlemen, you have eyes but you cannot see."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Galaxies surround us, limitless vistas."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,And yet the Federation would have us grub away like some ants on some somewhat larger than usual anthill.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,But I am not an insect.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"I am master of the universe, and I must claim my domain."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,As well it should be.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Peace mission!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Politicians and weaklings!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Mister Spock, do you consider Captain Kirk and yourself brothers?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Blind!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Truly blind!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Captain Kirk is your commanding officer and you are his subordinate.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,That is all.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yet, Mister Spock, you are a worthy commander in your own right, and in my fleet, you will surely have a Starship to command."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Out there waiting for me.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"They will flock to my cause, and for good reason."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Limitless power, limitless wealth, and solar systems ruled by the elite."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"We, gentlemen, are that elite, and we must take what is rightfully ours from the decadent weaklings that now hold it."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Lord Garth!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I was betrayed and treated barbarically.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Remove this animal!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Try some of this wine, Captain."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"It has a robust, full bodied flavour which you'll find diverting."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,And I prefer that you remain here.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Marta, my dear."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"We found your little divertissement enchanting, didn't we, Captain?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,But there's more to come.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,The entertainment has merely begun.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"By the way, I assume you play chess."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,So do I.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,How would you respond to queen to queen's level three?
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I'm interested in only one.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,For the life of me is a phrase well chosen.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,It could literally come to that.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"But I can make you long for death, beg for death."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Oh, don't beg, Marta!"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,It's degrading.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Queen to queen's level three, Captain."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,You'll talk freely and quite soon.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Appearances can be deceiving.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Once it was a part of the rehabilitation process, and as such, quite painless."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,And I might add useless too.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,It made men docile and of no use to me.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I've added certain refinements to the use of ultrasonic waves.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,The chair is no longer painless.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Put the governor in it.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Queen to queen's level three, Captain Kirk?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"It is, in fact, exquisitely painful, as you will now see."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Interesting, isn't it?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"The pain is real and can be prolonged indefinitely, because there is no actual destruction of tissue."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Of course, Captain."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,You have but to ask.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Now, as you can see, he has not been harmed physically, yet the memory of the exquisite torment remains."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Queen to queen's level three, Captain."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Too bad.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Remove our distinguished governor.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Put Captain Kirk in the chair.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You really are becoming offensive to me, my dear."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Don't make it necessary for me to put you in it.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Queen to queen's level three, Captain Kirk."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You want him, don't you?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Badly enough to join him?
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,It might be interesting to have you try.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Blast away, Captain, if you can."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Do you think I'm fool enough to give you a charged phaser?
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"I have done nothing with him as of yet, but I do have plans for him."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"The Vulcan will die rather horribly, and his death will be on your conscience."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Lord Garth!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"And I was the greatest of them all, wasn't I?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I have never been more healthy.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I can't remember.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,It's almost as if I had died and was reborn.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, I do remember that."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"It was a great responsibility, but one I was proud to bear."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I don't want to hear any more.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You're weak, you're trying to drain my strength."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I am Lord Garth!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Master of the universe!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,You doubt me only because I have not as yet had my coronation.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Stop!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,On your knees.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,On your knees before me!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,All the others before me have failed.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan, Krotus!"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,All of them are dust!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,But I will triumph!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I will make the ultimate conquest!
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,The throne must be higher.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,It must be higher than anything else in this room.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Use that table as a pedestal.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Ah, welcome back, Captain Kirk."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I'm glad you could make it for the coronation.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Yes.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Oh, I know that even a real throne is no more than merely a chair, but the symbolism is important, don't you agree?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"But again, just as a token."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Not impressive in itself, but it will serve as a standard around which our followers will rally."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You do refuse to enter into the spirit of the thing, don't you, Captain?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Perhaps you'd like a larger role in the ceremony.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You could serve as human sacrifice, for example."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,How true.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"All right, how about crown prince?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,That would make you our heir apparent.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Heir apparent, I believe, is the proper role for you."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Besides, we have other candidates for our human sacrifice."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Who knows?
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Ready.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Well, since there is no one mighty enough to perform this ceremony, we'll perform it ourselves."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Therefore, we hereby proclaim that I am Lord Garth, master of the universe."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,And we designate our beloved Marta to be our consort.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,And we further designate Captain James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise to be our heir apparent.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Now remove our heir apparent that we may conclude this ceremony.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Well done.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Well, Captain, you continue to resist."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,How stupid of you.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Put him in that chair right here.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I've arranged a small entertainment.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I wouldn't want him to miss any of it.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Well, Captain, even you must admit that I'm a genius."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,What you see here is my latest invention.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"This is an explosive, the most powerful one in history."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"If I were to drop this flask, the resulting explosion would vaporise this planet."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Now do you see why it is ridiculous to resist me?
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Well, perhaps you require the demonstration I've arranged."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Watch closely.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Now, it is true that she is deadly as a poisonous serpent, but she is also a beautiful woman, and you have held her in your arms, Captain."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I've ordered my men to drive her out of the protective dome.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"And, of course, she would choke to death on the outside in minutes."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"But I've arranged a more merciful end for her because after all, Captain, she is my consort."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"One tiny crystal implanted in her necklace, a portion of this explosive no bigger than a grain of sand."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I propose to detonate it from here.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Poor girl.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Poor, dear, suffering child."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I will help her now.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Here.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"How are your nerves, Kirk?"
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"You're an extraordinary fellow, Kirk."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Your stubbornness defies all logic.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Logic, that is the key."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Your friend Spock is a logical man.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,A very logical man.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Go and bring the Vulcan here to me.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Spock is not only a more logical man than you, Captain, but a more intelligent one, I'm sure."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I shall establish a rapport with him.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Fascinating.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Your Vulcan friend is a very ingenious fellow.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,This could be most amusing.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Starship.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,Starship.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"No, Captain."
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,The medicine seems to be taking effect.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,I can manage.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,It's very encouraging.
GARTH,Whom Gods Destroy,"Should I know you, sir?"
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Scott here, sir."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Queen to queen's level three.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"I said, queen to queen's level three."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"I'm following your orders, Captain."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Queen to queen's level three.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,I gave him the sign.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Why didn't he give me the countersign?
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Using the chess problem was the Captain's own suggestion.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"He couldn't have forgotten it, and I can't believe he was testing me."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Lieutenant, re establish communication."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Send an armed detail to the transporter room immediately.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Mister Sulu, what do your sensors show?"
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"We could blast our way through the field, but only at the risk of destroying the Captain, Mister Spock and any other living thing on Elba Two."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,No breakthrough?
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Sensor readings?
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Aye, you're right."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Even if they made it, they couldn't carry anything powerful enough to break through the asylum dome."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Only the ship herself could do that.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Scott here, Captain."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,You had us worried.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"They're already in the transporter room, sir."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Aye, aye, sir."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Waiting for your order, Captain."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Still waiting, Captain."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Queen to queen's level three.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Repeat.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Queen to queen's level three.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Give the countersign as ordered.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Security detail, standby to beam down."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Point nine five!
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Immediate probe.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Is the force field in place, Mister Sulu?"
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Doctor, I told you we couldn't do it without killing everyone in the asylum dome."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Well, there's one last thing we might try."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Perhaps the ship's phasers can cut through a section of the force field at its weakest point.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Where did you say that was located, Mister Sulu?"
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Prepare to change orbital path, Mister Sulu."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Break synchronous orbit.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Come to course one four mark six eight.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Ship's phasers to narrow beam.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Let's punch a hole in it.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Full power.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Another blast, full power."
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Enterprise here.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,Queen to queen's level three.
SCOTT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Aye, aye, sir."
MCCOY,Whom Gods Destroy,Something's wrong.
MCCOY,Whom Gods Destroy,How can we be powerful enough to wipe out a planet and still be so helpless?
MCCOY,Whom Gods Destroy,"It won't work, Scotty."
MCCOY,Whom Gods Destroy,They'd have to cover thousands of miles through poisonous atmosphere before they'd ever reach the asylum.
MCCOY,Whom Gods Destroy,Probably kill Jim and Spock.
MCCOY,Whom Gods Destroy,It must've wiped out everything.
MCCOY,Whom Gods Destroy,Got to break through it somehow.
MCCOY,Whom Gods Destroy,"I know it, Scotty."
MCCOY,Whom Gods Destroy,Will it leave a margin of safety for the people below?
MCCOY,Whom Gods Destroy,Intravenous is indicated unless circumstances make it impossible.
MCCOY,Whom Gods Destroy,Reversal of arterial and brain damage should begin almost immediately.
UHURA,Whom Gods Destroy,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,Whom Gods Destroy,"There's no response, Mister Scott."
UHURA,Whom Gods Destroy,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,Whom Gods Destroy,"No, Mister Scott."
UHURA,Whom Gods Destroy,Still no response from the planet.
UHURA,Whom Gods Destroy,"Mister Scott, it's the captain."
UHURA,Whom Gods Destroy,(at Spock's station) Life continues to exist on the planet.
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,"We can't beam anybody down, sir."
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,"The force field on the planet is in full operation, and all forms of transport into the asylum dome are blocked off."
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,The force field is weakest on the far side of the planet.
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,We can send down a shuttlecraft carrying a team in environmental suits.
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,There's been an explosion on Elba Two!
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, sir."
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,Solidly.
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,"On the far side of the planet, Mister Scott."
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,"Yes, sir."
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,"Orbital co-ordinates released, sir."
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,Course one four mark six eight.
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,"Synchronous orbit re-established, sir."
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,"Ship's phasers ready, sir."
SULU,Whom Gods Destroy,"Force field still holding, sir."
SCOT,Whom Gods Destroy,"Doctor, they may already be dead."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"I shall be interested in hearing your description, Captain."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Lieutenant Uhura.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Do we have final clearance from Gideon?
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"May I have them, please?"
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Eight seven five.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Zero two zero.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Zero seven nine.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Energising.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Put it on the screen.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"This is Mister Spock, Ambassador Hodin."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Captain Kirk was transported down minutes ago.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,I transported him myself.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,He was beamed directly to your council chambers.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Please verify your co-ordinates.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"I am not questioning that, sir."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"I do not deny that, sir."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,I am not attempting to blame your personnel.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Your Excellency, even with intricate machinery as delicately balanced as ours, there is still a margin for error which must be dealt with."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,It is possible that Captain Kirk materialised on some other part of Gideon.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Your Excellency.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,May I cut right to the heart of the matter?
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,I request permission to beam down to conduct a search for our captain.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Your Excellency, the wars between opposing star systems no longer prevail in our galaxy."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,If you will grant permission
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,We must acknowledge once and for all that the purpose of diplomacy is to prolong a crisis.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"We are representatives of the Federation, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Unfortunately, diplomacy is the only channel available to us at the moment."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"The planet is shielded from our sensors, therefore we cannot scan it."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Therefore we are unable to select co-ordinates.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,They must be provided by Gideon.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"We did not, Mister Chekov."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,The Federation did.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Lieutenant Uhura.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Contact Starfleet immediately.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Explain our problem.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Request permission to use every means at our disposal to press the search for Captain Kirk.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"There are endless, Mister Chekov."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Institute a sensor scan three hundred and sixty degrees, one degree at a time."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Then the sooner you begin, the better."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Lieutenant Uhura, has Starfleet honoured our request with a reply?"
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Did you advise them the captain's life is at stake?
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,What department?
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Contact them directly.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently, but they achieve exactly the same results."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,But that is not what we requested.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Your record on the subject is not precise, Your Excellency."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Your Excellency, a dispute is the farthest thing from our minds, and there's no need to check your records."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,I merely suggest that the language of our statement may not have been understood exactly as intended.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"True, Your Excellency."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Your Excellency, I am basically a scientist."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Clarity of formulation is essential in my profession also.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, Your Excellency."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, Your Excellency."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"I apologise for the noise, your Excellency."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"To summarise, I request permission to transport down to Gideon."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Mister Scott, you'll go to the transporter room and await my orders."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, Your Excellency."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"The ship's engineer was explaining that the malfunction, which did exist, has now been repaired."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,We would appreciate an opportunity to test the equipment.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"I, therefore, request permission"
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,To beam down to your council chamber.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Your Excellency, grant this one request."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Thank you, Your Excellency."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Your proposal is accepted.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Mister Scott.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Prepare to beam aboard a representative of the Gideon council.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Co-ordinates.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Your Excellency, your assistant has arrived safely, and I am now ready to transport down to Gideon."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Sir, our captain is still missing, and I now demand that I be allowed to transport to Gideon as we agreed."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Mister Scott, beam down the gentleman from Gideon."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Do not give up hope.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Command."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Demand an immediate reply to our request for permission to beam down to Gideon.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Admiral, the crew will not understand it."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,We wish only to save the life of the captain.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"I am positive that I can do so to your satisfaction, Admiral."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"I have been convinced, since my first exchange with the ambassador, that the captain has been taken prisoner."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"I now know where the captain is being held, if he is being held at the same place to which we transported him."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Sir, the captain is not being held in the Gideon council chamber."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,He is being held nearby.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Since the planet is shielded from our sensors, we cannot establish that without on the spot investigation."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Admiral, I wish to state for the record that your decision is completely arbitrary."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"They did not ask for our understanding, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Unfortunately, I must violate a direct order from Starfleet."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"I do not make it lightly, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"However, Command knows that Ambassador Hodin has not been totally honest with us."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Lieutenant Uhura, repeat original Gideon co-ordinates for beam down."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Mister Scott, the co-ordinates given you?"
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Precisely.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,I shall beam down at once.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Mister Scott, you have the conn."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Negative, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,I cannot accept the responsibility for ordering a fellow officer to violate a Starfleet directive.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,I can make such a decision only for myself.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"The situation forces me to do so, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,This will not take long.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,(into intercom) Captain Kirk.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Spock here.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Captain Kirk?
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,An exact duplicate of the Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,But completely inoperative.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,(into communicator) Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,I am speaking to you from the bridge of the Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"On the bridge of the Enterprise, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,And they were correct.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,I'm on board an exact duplicate of the Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"In orbit, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"In a manner of speaking, Gideon is in orbit and the ship is on Gideon."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,I'm sure he's on board somewhere.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,I'm picking up life readings.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Spock out.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Your Excellency.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Captain, you're looking well."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Evidently Starfleet's analysis was correct.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Three to beam up, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Negative.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,Lock in on my communicator signal.
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Your Excellency, please do not interfere."
SPOCK,The Mark Of Gideon,I already have one serious problem to resolve with upper echelons.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,You won't have long to wait.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Let's go, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Mister Spock?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,(goes to intercom) Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I have not yet transported down.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Why did you leave your post before confirming transport?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Mister Spock?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Spock?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Engineering?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Mister Scott?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Scotty!
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Lieutenant Uhura, report immediately."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"All bridge personnel, report immediately."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Kirk to crew.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Is anyone aboard?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Sickbay?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Doctor McCoy?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Bones?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Bones, answer me."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Bones.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Still orbiting Gideon.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I am alone on the Enterprise.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"I have searched every area of the ship and still cannot find a trace of the crew, or an indication of how its disappearance was managed."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"The one thing that is obvious is that I suffered a memory lapse, during which time I bruised my arm."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,It is causing me some irritation.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Who are you?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,What are you doing on my ship?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Not my personal property, but I'm the captain."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"It seems, at the moment, we have it all to ourselves."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Kirk.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I'm sorry.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,James Kirk.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,And I didn't bring you here.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,That's right.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Who has brought you here?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,You?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,What happened before you came here?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Try to remember.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,It's important.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Don't be afraid.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I seem to be the only one of my crew left on board the Enterprise.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Four hundred and thirty, and I, apparently, am the only one left."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Maybe you can.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Tell me the rest.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"You were fighting for oxygen, screaming to get out of there."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,How long have you been aboard the Enterprise?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,It might be.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Come with me.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Nine minutes of my life has been lost.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Between the time I tried to beam down to Gideon and the time I found myself here alone, nine minutes have disappeared just like that."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Now what happened during those minutes?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,That's your home.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,The planet that you come from.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,It must be.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,That's impossible.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,We were in synchronous orbit over the capital city of Gideon.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"I tried to beam down, something happened, and you were beamed aboard from Gideon."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,We're no longer over Gideon.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I don't know.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I'm not familiar with that quadrant.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Odona, you must realise that we're not here by accident."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Some force, some intelligence has arranged this for a purpose."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Enterprise to Starfleet Command.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Enterprise to Starfleet Command.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Captain Kirk here.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Red priority.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Red priority.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,It seems to be.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Captain Kirk here.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Please answer red priority.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Please answer red priority.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Well, if someone is listening, they're not answering."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,They wouldn't.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Took the ship out of warp speed.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Space terminology.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,We're no longer moving faster than the speed of light.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I've trimmed down to sublight speed until we find out where we are.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Of course it does.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Maybe it is the same.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"(referring to viewscreen) If you believe that, we have."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"It isn't really, you know."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Yes.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, it is."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Very, very beautiful."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,How long would you like it to last?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Well, let's see."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Power, that's no problem, it regenerates."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,And food.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,We have enough to feed a crew of four hundred and thirty for five years.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,So that should last us
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Most people are afraid of being alone.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Why?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Why are the people of Gideon like that?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,It might be Gideon.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Yes.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,It might help me pinpoint our location.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I've got to contact whoever is manipulating us.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,There must be a way.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Odona.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Odona, can you remember why your people dream of being alone?"
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Why?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,What makes it so impossible to be alone?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Who sent you here?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,You've come to kill.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Odona, have you come to die?"
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Now, all I have to do is find a medical kit, and I can completely cure this."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,(his arm)
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, the irritation would be gone."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,No.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Over something as simple as this?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"No, it'll cure itself eventually, but."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Do you know, uh I don't even remember how this happened."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Do you hear that?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"No, the ship's engines don't make that kind of sound."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I know every sound that this ship might make.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,That's coming from outside.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"A storm might, but you wouldn't be able to hear it."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Come on.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,This is a viewing port.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,We'll be able to see outside.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"If there's a storm, we'll be able to see it."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,If it works.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"It was like the heartbeat of all those people, and thousands upon thousands more pressing against the ship."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, I said that."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, they can."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,It could be a mirage.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,They could exist in our minds.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Or some power is creating the illusion in our minds that we are somewhere near your planet.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,But why?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I think I have an idea.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"So that we won't keep trying to find out where we are, that we'll be content to stay here."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Be content?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Be content?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Not until I find out what happened to my crew.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Are they dead?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Did you kill them so you could have the ship to yourself?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I've never felt like this before either.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"There's no sickness on your planet, remember?"
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Hodin.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Let me in there.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I can help her.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,But she's ill.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Let me see her.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,You don't know what she may have.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"It's very rare, and always fatal if not treated within twenty four hours."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"I know, it almost killed me."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,That's how my arm got hurt.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,You're mad.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Your report to the Federation was a tissue of lies.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"You described environmental, physical, cultural conditions that would make Gideon a paradise."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Those are conditions most people would envy.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Then why haven't you introduced any of the new techniques to sterilise men and women?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Then let your people learn about the devices to safely prevent conception.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,The Federation will provide anything you need.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,And the great misery which you now face.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Yet you can kill a young girl.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,You're killing your own daughter.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,How can you do that?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,The virus you need is very rare.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Who will provide it?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"No sir, not me."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,You have many methods available.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I've mentioned only a few.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,I do not offer my life for this purpose.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"I have many plans, and I have hopes other than death for Odona."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,What was said and what happened between us was for us alone.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,So that was your plan.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,That I would fall so under her spell that I would give up my freedom and become a willing sacrifice.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"If you don't allow me to bring Doctor McCoy down here, it'll soon be too late to do anything for her."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Her death is unnecessary.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Even if she lives, her blood will provide the same serum you need as mine would."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Very short.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,And it can continue.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"If only you'll allow me, I can cure you."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Mister Spock, we have a patient for Doctor McCoy."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Have Scotty beam us up.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Why, because you're well again?"
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,At least you owe me the privilege of letting me look at you.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Thank you, ma'am."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Is that what you want to do?
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"You're needed everywhere, Odona."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Oh, yes, it is."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,It's exactly the same.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,Only this one works.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, it goes to the whole galaxy."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,With another difference.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,This one is crowded.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,It does now.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, Odona, I have to."
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,(into intercom) Kirk to transporter control.
KIRK,The Mark Of Gideon,One to beam down to the planet Gideon.
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, Mister Spock."
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, Mister Spock."
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,They have provided us with the co-ordinates for beam down.
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,Eight seven five.
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,Zero two zero.
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,Zero seven nine.
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Gideon is contacting us, Mister Spock."
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, Mister Spock."
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,"At once, sir."
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,"There has been no response as yet, sir."
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,They insist that the matter must be referred to the Federation.
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,Bureau of Planetary Treaties.
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,"I did, Mister Spock."
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,They insist that we must go through Starfleet channels.
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,"The ambassador will speak, sir."
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,They're requesting visual communication.
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, he's infuriating, sir."
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,How can you stand it?
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, Mister Spock."
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,Enterprise to Starfleet Command.
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,Enterprise to Starfleet Command.
UHURA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Eight seven five, zero two zero, zero seven nine."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Captain Kirk, this is Ambassador Hodin."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,The council is still awaiting your arrival.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,That's impossible.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,He never arrived.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Eight seven five, zero two zero, zero seven nine."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,We gave you the exact co-ordinates which should have brought Captain Kirk directly to this very room.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"If he is not here, that is your own responsibility, Mister Spock, and that of your staff."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,We are glad to hear that.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,We shall enter it into the records of this most unfortunate event.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Let us hope it was on dry land.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Permission denied.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Your Federation must be aware
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Of our jealous tradition of isolation from all contaminating contacts
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,With the violent nature of planets of other star systems.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Of course, we shall institute a thorough search."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"In the meantime, Mister Spock, I suggest that you look to your machinery."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Good news.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Very good news indeed, Mister Spock."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Your captain is definitely not on Gideon.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"As you requested, we made a most thorough search, and you will be relieved to know that you may now investigate all the other possibilities and forget about Gideon."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,You requested a most thorough search.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,It is in the record.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,And we have used every means at our disposal to accommodate you.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Surely, Mister Spock, you do not intend, I hope, to create a dispute between the Federation and Gideon?"
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Mister Spock, you're an officer of a spaceship."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"In your profession, you use many instruments, tools and weapons to achieve your objectives."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"However, the only tool diplomacy has is language."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,It is of the utmost importance that the meaning be crystal clear.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,I'm glad to hear it.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Perhaps you could then make greater effort to choose your words more precisely.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Mister Spock!
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Mister Spock!
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Are you still there?
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,There was considerable interference with your transmission.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,A lot of noise drowned out
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,What was said.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Would you repeat, please?"
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Forgive me, Mister Spock."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,No criticism of your equipment was intended.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"But it has sent your captain on some strange journey, a safe one we all still hope."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"But it could create for us serious incidents with your Federation, and now you propose to"
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Repeat this disaster with another officer?
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,This would be madness.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"I could not quite make that out, Mister Spock."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Would you be so good as to repeat what you said?
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"But, Mister Spock, you"
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"You are a very persistent fellow, Mister Spock."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Very well, then, You shall test the skill of your very excitable"
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Repairman.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,There is one proviso.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,We cannot risk further incidents.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,You will therefore transport a member of my staff to your ship.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Let us first see if that works.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"My assistant will provide you with the proper, what is the word?"
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Thank you.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Proceed, Krodak."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Now, now, not so fast, Mister Spock."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,That is quite a different matter.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"We agreed to allow one representative on our soil, your captain."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Forgive me, Mister Spock, but I overstepped my authority when I made that agreement."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"However, your request will be taken up at the next full session of Gideon's council."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, Captain Kirk."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Our experiment has passed the first stage.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,We have no need of any of your medicines.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,And we're grateful to you for her illness.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"You have done well, my daughter."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Guard the captain well.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,We shall need him for a long time.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,That depends on the strength of the one infected.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,You have great strength.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Your body temperature will be very great.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"You will see us, but you will not know who we are."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Rest.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Now lie still.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Do you feel great pain?
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,What is it like to feel pain?
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Your courage gives me great pride.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Not yet.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,But we do.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,She has Vegan choriomeningitis.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Yes.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Our prime minister learned about you during our negotiations.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,That's why we brought you here.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Your blood provided the micro-organisms which infected her.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Yes.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"As Odona told you, we have no need for medical practitioners here."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Our apologies.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,We were unforgivably awkward to have hurt you.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,No.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,We are desperate.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,And so it was!
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"A long, long time ago what we described was true!"
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,The atmosphere on Gideon has always been germ-free.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,And the people flourished in their physical and spiritual perfection.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Eventually, even the life span increased."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Death became almost unknown to us.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"It occurred only when the body could no longer regenerate itself, and that happens now only to the very old."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,But Gideon did not find it enviable.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"The birth rate continued to rise, and the population grew, until now Gideon is encased in a living mass who can find no rest, no peace, no joy."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Every organ renews itself.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,It would be impossible.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"But you see, the people of Gideon have always believed that life is sacred."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,That the love of life is the greatest gift.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,That is the one unshakable truth of Gideon.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,And this overwhelming love of life has developed our regenerative capacity and our great longevity.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"That is bitterly true, Captain."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Nevertheless, we cannot deny the truth which shaped our evolution."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,We are incapable of destroying or interfering with the creation of that which we love so deeply.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"Life, in every form, from foetus to developed being."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"It is against our tradition, against our very nature."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,We simply could not do it.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,We're trying to re-adjust the life cycle of an entire civilisation.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,My daughter hoped to make you feel the agony of Gideon.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,But it was impossible.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,No stranger could realize the horror that life can be here.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"I will not beg for your understanding of my personal grief, nor will I parade it for you to gain your co-operation."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,My love for my daughter is too deep for display.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,My pride in her runs even deeper.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"My daughter freely chose to do what she is doing, as the people of Gideon are free to choose."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,You will stay.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Your blood will provide it.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,My daughter pleaded with you to stay.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,She hoped you would love her and wish to stay.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Stay with us.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,We're desperate.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"You see, you cannot leave us now."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,Go to her.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"We have told you, it is her wish and mine that there be no interference with the natural progress of the virus."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"No, her death at so young an age will let the people know for certain that our lifecycle can be changed."
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,It's the symbol that'll bring forth the dedicated young volunteers.
HODIN,The Mark Of Gideon,"The serum in their new blood will change Gideon, and it will once more be the paradise it was."
CHEKOV,The Mark Of Gideon,Co-ordinates confirmed.
CHEKOV,The Mark Of Gideon,We should never have agreed to such restrictions.
CHEKOV,The Mark Of Gideon,Are there any other possibilities?
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,"Well, what are we waiting for, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,We're not diplomats.
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,That doesn't mean we have behave like children and listen to some fool lecture by a diplomat!
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,"Well, where do we start, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,You mean you're going to scan space for him?
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,Are you going to let him get away with that?
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,We do not leave without being absolutely sure ourselves that everything has been done.
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,Now certainly you understand our feelings about that.
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,"Just when I was beginning to think you might find a whole new career as a diplomat, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,I don't understand how Starfleet can deny permission to beam down to search for the captain.
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,"That's the best possible decision you could make, Spock."
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,I'm with you.
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,Co-ordinates don't match.
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,I'll pick up my medical tricorder and meet you in the transporter room.
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,I'm not asking you to make the decision for me.
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,"In that case, it's the worst possible decision you can make, Spock."
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,An exact duplicate of the Enterprise?
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,"Is it in orbit, Mister Spock?"
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,"Well, that's a beginning, but what about the captain?"
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,"Well, that was close, but you made it."
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,Right.
MCCOY,The Mark Of Gideon,Just like the captain.
SULU,The Mark Of Gideon,"But, sir, that could take years."
SULU,The Mark Of Gideon,"Aye, sir."
SULU,The Mark Of Gideon,"With the captain lost, sir, that's the best they could come up with?"
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Odona.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, my name is Odona."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Why did you bring me here?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Is this entire ship yours?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,And you have it all to yourself?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"You're hurting me, Captain"
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,If you didn't bring me
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I don't know.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"It seems I was standing in a, yes."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I was standing in a large auditorium crowded with people.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Thousands pressed in against me.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I could hardly breathe.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"I was fighting for oxygen, screaming to get out."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"I'm not, but you are troubled."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I'm sorry.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I wish I could help.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"And then I, suddenly I was here on this, on your ship."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,And there was all this space.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,And the freedom.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I just wanted to float.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,And then there you were.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I don't know.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Not long.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Is it important?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I don't understand.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,What is Gideon?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Is it?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Gideon?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I don't know any Gideon.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I do not think so.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Where are we?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Captain, before I said I wasn't afraid."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Now I am.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Isn't it in working order?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Then someone should have heard you.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Why should they do that?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,What did you do?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Out of what?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,It feels the same.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Well, has the ship slowed down?"
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Oh, please!"
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Don't tell me the sky is out of order now.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,It's so quiet.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,So peaceful.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,And it's beautiful.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,And we're alone.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Can you make it last a long, long time?"
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Forever.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Forever.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,All my life I've dreamed of being alone.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Where I come from, people dream of it."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Gideon?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"I told you, I don't know where I come from, what my planet is."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Does it matter so much?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,And then you might find your crew.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Being here with you, I forgot there must be others."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I envy you your sense of loyalty.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"I want to ease your feeling of dread, your fear that all your crew no longer exists."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Because they never can be.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Because there are so many of us.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,So many.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"There is no place, no street, no house, no garden, no beach, no mountain that is not filled with people."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Each one of us would kill in order to find a place alone to himself.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"They would willingly die for it, if they could."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,No one commands Odona.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I was not sent here.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I don't know.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I don't care.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I only know I'm here.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I only know I'm happy.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Cure?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,What will happen if you do not find one?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Will you become sick and die?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, it sounds like an engine."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,But there is something wrong with the equipment.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Could that be it?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,A storm might
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,People.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,The faces of people.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,And then the stars.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,What's happening?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,What's out there?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,The sound is gone.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,But you said we were moving through space.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Then the people can't be out there.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Please don't frighten me.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,You mean that we're going mad.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I don't know.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I don't know.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Oh, be content!"
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I don't know.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Captain.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Captain, something's happening to me."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I never felt like this before.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Is this the way one looks when one is developing a sickness?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Now there will be.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,There will be sickness.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,There will be death.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Will it last long?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,How will you know when I am to die?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"I must see him before then, Father."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Yes, in my arms and thighs."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"It is like, like when you see the people have no hope for happiness, Father."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"You feel great despair, and your heart is heavy because you know you can do nothing."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Pain is like that.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I'm glad that you are here.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Is the time short?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,And I asked you to make our journey last forever.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Oh.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,It began here.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"I'm not afraid of what will happen, but it's just that now I wish with all my heart to stay with you forever."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I am cured?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"Instead of smiling at me, you should be shouting in anger."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,No.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Because I pretended to be (pause) How can you bear to look at me after the way I deceived you?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"You are a gentleman, Captain Kirk."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,You are no longer needed on Gideon.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I can take your place there.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,That is what I must do.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,I am needed there now.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,It is not like our ship.
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,It goes to many other planets?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,It seems crowded to you?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,Are you going to stay on the ship?
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"As crowded as my planet is, I could wish for it to hold one more person."
ODONA,The Mark Of Gideon,"I will miss you, Captain James Kirk."
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,"No matter what you say, Mister Spock, he'll twist your meaning."
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,"I'll not take that, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,That transporter was in perfect condition.
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,I guarantee that myself.
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,"Transport me down right this minute, and I'll prove to those gentlemen."
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,"Aye, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,Scott here.
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,"Aye, aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,Eight seven five.
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,Zero two zero.
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,Seven zero nine.
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,Energising.
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,"Mister Spock, the gentleman from Gideon is here."
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,I don't see how they expect us to sit here and wait for the captain to reappear.
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,"Eight seven five, zero two zero, seven zero nine."
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,Isn't that just about what Captain Kirk said before he left?
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,"Scott here, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,You're where?
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,Those were the co-ordinates you insisted on.
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,Scott here.
SCOTT,The Mark Of Gideon,Same co-ordinates?
KRODAK,The Mark Of Gideon,(standing) Eight seven five.
KRODAK,The Mark Of Gideon,Zero two zero.
KRODAK,The Mark Of Gideon,Seven zero nine.
KRODAK,The Mark Of Gideon,Odona's fever is rising.
KRODAK,The Mark Of Gideon,She's calling the name of James Kirk.
ADMIRAL,The Mark Of Gideon,"I sympathize deeply, but Starfleet cannot override Federation directives in this matter."
ADMIRAL,The Mark Of Gideon,Has your crew suddenly become interested in provoking a war?
ADMIRAL,The Mark Of Gideon,That is not Starfleet's mission.
ADMIRAL,The Mark Of Gideon,"You have not proved your case to the Federation, or to Starfleet, for that matter."
ADMIRAL,The Mark Of Gideon,"Granted as fact, Mister Spock."
ADMIRAL,The Mark Of Gideon,They would not dare harm him in the Gideon council chamber.
ADMIRAL,The Mark Of Gideon,You have answered what and where.
ADMIRAL,The Mark Of Gideon,I'm waiting for your explanation of why.
ADMIRAL,The Mark Of Gideon,Do you have evidence the captain's life is threatened?
ADMIRAL,The Mark Of Gideon,Permission denied.
ADMIRAL,The Mark Of Gideon,So noted.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"You're the sanest, the smartest, the nicest woman that has ever come aboard this ship."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Anything else, I'll keep to myself for the moment."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,(turning from Mira) Hmm?
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Excuse me.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Mira!
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Mira!
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Mira!
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,(her eyes and mouth are open) What's that you're saying'?
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Well, after the disturbance was over, she just collapsed."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"How's she doing, Doctor?"
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Easy, now."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Easy.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,You had quite a fall.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Aye, they are."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Now you just do what Doctor McCoy ordered.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, would it be all right if I went along to Sickbay?"
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,But Captain
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"She might have something there, Doctor McCoy."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"This is her first deep space trip, and you know that affects people."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Come on now, Mira."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,We must help the doctor.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Tell us what happened.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,I'm sure that's what the lieutenant wants.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,She just didn't understand.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Did you now, lass?"
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Oh, you will not!"
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,That's ridiculous.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"This getting used to space travel, that takes some doing."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,And not everybody takes to it.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Well, me, that's different."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,I was practically born to it.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,You will.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,You passed your Starfleet preliminary examinations.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,And this is just getting used to what you might call your space legs.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Scott here.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,In the Sickbay.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Och, no."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,I was just checking on the lass.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,She's going to be fine now.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,There's nothing wrong with her.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"I'm afraid this light'll have to do, Captain."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,The generator is inoperative.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Captain!
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Mira!
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,The captain has some questions.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Wait, Captain."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,We've lost Mira.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Stabilise her!
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Let me.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Listen to me.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,I've told you what strange tricks a space trip can play on your mind.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Now, that's all it is."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Have you ever had visions of the future events before this?
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Well, if you ask me, nobody ever has."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"That seeing to the future, it's pure bunk."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"You know that, don't you?"
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,And you were perfectly right.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Space.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Space, that's all it is."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Well, if you want to spend the rest of the trip in Sickbay."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,But what good would that do?
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Doctor McCoy can no more cure it than he can a cold.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,What?
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Mira.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Mira.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Mira!
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Mira.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Captain!
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, the phaser shots, they're killing Mira!"
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Aye.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"When you fired the phasers, they stunned her and she crumpled."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Another shot and you'll kill her!
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Mira has tried to tell me all along that she was seeing things in advance.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,You don't report space sickness.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,That's all I thought it was.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"The first attack on the ship, the attack on Memory Alpha and the time we nearly lost her."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,And?
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,And?
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"I thought for a moment there was something else, but I guess I was wrong."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,We've lost her to them.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Stay with us, Mira."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Please stay.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,You won't let them.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Mira.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Mira!
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Captain.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Mira will not kill me.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,I told you she wouldn't kill me.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"(intercom) It's all right, Mira."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,They're gone.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,They're gone!
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,Now we have all the time in the world.
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Scott here, sir."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Beautiful, Captain."
SCOTT,The Lights Of Zetar,"Positively, Captain."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Anything else?
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"We're ready, sir."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Thank you.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"I'm, I'm fine."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"I'm fine, Doctor."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Really, I am."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Is everybody else all right?
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Why?
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I feel
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, sir."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"What's that you're doing, Nurse?"
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,But why?
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I haven't had a single response worth noting.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Well, have l?"
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I want to know why too.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"You're the doctor, you tell me."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,This is a new experience for me.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,All of you are accustomed to new experiences.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,It's part of your work.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I'm not.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Nothing.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Absolutely nothing.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Doctor, there is nothing more I can tell you."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Are you putting that into my record?
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,It's not true.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"When the record of this is forwarded, I'll be sent back, won't I."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Did you?
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I want to continue.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I hope that's all it is.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, Captain."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,What did I say?
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,What did it sound like?
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,What technician?
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,We must get back to the ship!
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"That storm, it's returning."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I know.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,You'll be killed if we stay.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I tell you t will kill us.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"I saw those men dead, in their exact positions!"
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"No, Scotty."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Never.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I've always believed it.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Then what is it, Scotty?"
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,What's frightening me?
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Ever since that storm hit, I've, I've had such strange thoughts, such feelings of terror."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Then I don't have to report it?
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Help, Scotty!"
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Hold me.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,It's happening again.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,No!
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"No, Scotty."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,No!
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,No.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Scotty!
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"I didn't mean to be unco-operative, Doctor."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I'll tell you everything I know.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I trust all of you implicitly.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I want to help.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,You mustn't worry about hurting me.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, there was one other time."
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I saw Scotty.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I don't know.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,He was dying.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Now I understand what's been happening.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I've been seeing through another mind.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I've been flooded with thoughts not my own that control me.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Oh, Scotty, Scotty!"
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I'd rather die than hurt you.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I'd rather die.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Tell me what to do.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Don't touch me, Scotty!"
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Stay away.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I'm trying.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I want to be with you.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,They are too strong.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I am Mira Romaine.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I will be who I choose to be.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I will.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Stay away, Scotty!"
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,They are with me.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,They will kill you.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,Life was given to me.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,It is mine.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I want to live it out.
MIRA,The Lights Of Zetar,I will
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"When a man of Scotty's years falls in love, the loneliness of his life is suddenly revealed to him."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,His whole heart once throbbed only to the ship's engines.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,He could talk only to the ship.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Now he can see nothing but the woman.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Mister Scott.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Mister Scott?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"As soon as we're within viewing range of Memory Alpha, you and Lieutenant Romaine will go to the emergency manual monitor."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,You’ll prepare for direct transfer of equipment.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Lieutenant, may I offer my congratulations on what will be your first assignment for the Federation?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Yes.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Good luck, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Is that Memory Alpha?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Magnification eight.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,What is that?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Readings?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Check that.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,No natural phenomena can move faster than the speed of light.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Deflectors on.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Condition yellow.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Mister Sulu, get us the devil out of here!"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Full scan on the disturbance that penetrated the Bridge.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Lieutenant, all decks, damage report."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Doctor McCoy to the Bridge.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Emergency.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Emergency.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,I don't know.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Did you notice, Scotty?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Get to Sickbay, Lieutenant."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,That's an order.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"No, Mister Scott."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Stay at your post for the moment.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Lieutenant Uhura.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Damage report.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Mister Spock?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Any damage to the warp engines?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Good.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"From the action of that storm, we'll need all the speed we can get."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Mister Spock, explanation."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Or attack.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,And Lieutenant Romaine seems most susceptible.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Main screen projection.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Lieutenant, try and warn Memory Alpha of the proximity of that phenomena."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Give me an ETA for its possible impact.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,No shields?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Wonderful.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,I hope the storm is aware of that rationale.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Are we within orbit range, Mister Chekov?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Lieutenant, try and warn them of"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Mister Spock, how many people are on Memory Alpha?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Lock into orbit.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Any life readings?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Let's find out what's going on down there.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Kirk to Engineering.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Mister Scott, report."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Kirk to Engineering.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Mister Scott.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Where the devil is he?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Scotty, report to the Bridge."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Report to the Bridge.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Have the transporter room stand by.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,I'm taking a landing party down.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Scotty, where've you been?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Where are you?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Are you sick?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Well, I'm relieved to hear your prognosis, Mister Scott."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Is the doctor there with you, or will I find him in Engineering?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Doctor, how's the girl?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Well, Mister Scott seems to agree with you."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,The two of you meet me in the transporter room on the double.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Scotty, can you get us some more light?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Damage report, Spock."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Locate him and keep him alive.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,We need more information about this enemy.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Bones, can you do something?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Are you sure?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Beam down Lieutenant Romaine immediately.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Spock, have you seen anything like that before?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Bones?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,What did she die of?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,What did the others die of?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"A different centre of the brain, you say?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Lieutenant, when you were unconscious, you were speaking."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,I don't know.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,The words were unfamiliar to me.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,They sounded exactly like the last words spoken by the technician.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Lieutenant.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Lieutenant.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Why?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Tell me why.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,How do you know?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,What's its course?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Beam us up.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Mister Sulu, this is the captain."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Get the Enterprise out of here.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Delay that order, Mister Sulu!"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"All right, Mister Sulu, get us out of here."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Mister Scott, check emergency manual monitor for transporter control."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Plot the new course, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Plot it.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Mister Spock, you made a statement that phenomenon is not a storm."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Explain.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,What is it?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Then deductive reasoning will have to be substituted.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Activate shields.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Mister Chekov, change course to one four three mark three."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Storm's course, Mister Sulu?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Take evasive action.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Hard starboard, two one seven mark five."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Hard port, one one seven mark two."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Is it closing?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Your analysis, Spock."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,What is it?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Who are they?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Where are they from?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,It's clear we can't outrun them.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Can we shield against them?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,There must be some defence we can use.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Maybe we can avoid another attack.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Lieutenant Uhura, open all channels."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Tie in the universal translator.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Mister Spock says it's alive.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Maybe I can talk to it.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,We wish you no harm.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Physical contact between us is fatal to our life forms.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Please, do not come any closer to our ship."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Perhaps it understands another kind of language.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Condition Red Alert.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Prepare for phaser firing.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Lock in phaser tracking controls.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Adjust phasers to fire across its course.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Do not hit it.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Fire.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Reaction, Mister Sulu?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Apparently a shot across the bow is insufficiently convincing.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Prepare to lock phasers into the heart of the community.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Fire.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Lock in for another blast.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Killing Lieutenant Romaine?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Get her to Sickbay at once.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Cancel that order.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Another attack on that alien life form will kill Lieutenant Romaine.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"If she is to survive, we can't attack."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Can the computer supply a defence based on the data you've been accumulating?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,And yet isolate the girl from its deadly effects.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Captain Kirk to Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Is the girl well enough to be questioned?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Have the Lieutenant and Mister Scott in the briefing room as quickly as possible.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Bring all available biographical material with you.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Mister Spock, come with me."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,I'll try.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Lieutenant Romaine.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,We must get to understand what is happening.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Ship's investigative procedures are sometimes confusing to a new crewman.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Don't let us upset you.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,This investigation has been prompted by two events.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"First is the time you passed out on the Bridge, and the second is when we fired our main phasers into that force that is attacking us and seriously injured you."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Now this is how we'll proceed.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Mister Spock has all the information available to us about our attackers.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Doctor McCoy has access to Starfleet's exhaustive files on you.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,A comparison of the two may turn up some improbable connection which may protect you and ourselves.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"All right, gentlemen?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Doctor McCoy, will you proceed?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Mister Spock, are you prepared with the background history of the attackers?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Thank you.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Mister Sulu, what is the status of our friends?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Continue evasive manoeuvres.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Keep me informed.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Doctor, do you have a medical record of Lieutenant Romaine available?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,I'd like a few items from her psychological profile checked.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Any history of psychosomatic illness?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Any evidence of involuntary or unconscious telepathic abilities?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Any pathological or unusual empathic responses?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Go ahead, Doctor."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Go ahead.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,That's impossible!
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Let's see it.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Check it, Spock."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Continue evasive action.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Keep me informed.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Why didn't you report it?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,What did she see?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Those were all acts carried out by our attacker.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, Scotty?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,What else?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Was he wrong, Lieutenant?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,What did you see?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Where?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,What was he doing?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,What success did you have?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Warp eight, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,They'll be here very soon.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,They may destroy you and us as they did Memory Alpha.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,You are especially susceptible to their will.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,But we have one chance to survive.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Don't resist.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Let them begin to function through you.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"If we can control that moment, we have a chance."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Will you try?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Captain Kirk to medical lab.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Prepare the antigrav test units.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Let's go.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"As soon as she has entered the gravity chamber, secure all ports."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Stay where you are.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Don't lose yourself to them.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Hold on.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,That's not Mira talking.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,I'm Captain James Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Do you understand?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Who are you?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,You can't be from Zetar.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,All life was destroyed there long ago.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Then what are you?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,All things die.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,The body of the one you inhabit has its own life to lead.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,She will not.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,She is fighting for her own identity.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Will she learn the way people on Memory Alpha learned?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,But you did kill!
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,The price of your survival is too high.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,You can't have her.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"You're entitled to your own life, but not another's."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,They'll be forced to accept it.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,We must get her into the pressure chamber.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Secure the chamber.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Neutralise gravity.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Pressurise the unit.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Bring pressure to two atmospheres and then increase one atmosphere per second.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Continue increasing pressure.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Pressure, Spock."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Pressure.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Continue, Spock."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Pressure!
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Bones, are you able to judge the long range effects on Lieutenant Romaine?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Would either of you credit Scotty's steadfast belief in her as a factor?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Do I take it both of you agree that Lieutenant Romaine need not return to Starbase for further treatment?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Captain Kirk to Mister Scott.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Mister Scott, how's Lieutenant Romaine?"
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, Mister Scott."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Do I take it you say that she is fit for duty?
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Thank you.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Kirk to Bridge.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Mister Sulu, set course for Memory Alpha."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Lieutenant Romaine has a lot of work to do there.
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Well, this is an Enterprise first."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and Engineer Scott find themselves in complete agreement."
KIRK,The Lights Of Zetar,Can I stand the strain?
CHEKOV,The Lights Of Zetar,I didn't think Mister Scott would go for the brainy type.
CHEKOV,The Lights Of Zetar,Captain.
CHEKOV,The Lights Of Zetar,It was not hands that were paralysed.
CHEKOV,The Lights Of Zetar,It was eyes.
CHEKOV,The Lights Of Zetar,I could not force my eyes to look down and set a new course.
CHEKOV,The Lights Of Zetar,"I cannot, sir."
CHEKOV,The Lights Of Zetar,It has the ability to change speed.
CHEKOV,The Lights Of Zetar,Completing approach to planetoid.
CHEKOV,The Lights Of Zetar,Making final approach.
CHEKOV,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, we are within orbit range."
CHEKOV,The Lights Of Zetar,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,The Lights Of Zetar,Present course is one two six mark twenty.
CHEKOV,The Lights Of Zetar,One four three mark three.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,I don't think he's even noticed she has a brain.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, I'm picking up a high intensity reading."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"No, sir."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, it's approaching at warp factor two point six and accelerating."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Shields activated, Captain."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"No, it was speech that was affected."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,I couldn't utter a sound.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, I've plotted the storm's path."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"On its present course, it will hit Memory Alpha planetoid as it did us."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"It is already over Memory Alpha, Captain!"
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Its speed is incredible.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,It's hitting the planetoid.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"It is leaving Memory Alpha, Captain."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Sulu here.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, sir."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Bridge, sir."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,The storm has reappeared on the long range scanner and is closing fast.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Coming back in this direction.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, it's changing course."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, it's heading straight for us."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Shields activated.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,One four three mark three.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Evasive action.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Two one seven mark five.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Still with us, sir."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,One one seven mark two.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Still with us, sir!"
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, change in velocity recorded."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,They are passing our starboard side and manoeuvreing in front of us.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Switching to forward scanner.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, change in velocity recorded."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,It has accelerated its approach.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Locked in, sir."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"None, sir."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,They're still approaching us.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Locked in, sir."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,The phasers seem to have stopped their approach.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,They're holding position.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Locked in, sir."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Ready for firing, Captain."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Status unchanged.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,They're still with us and keeping the same distance.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,The alien is no longer maintaining its distance.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Sulu, Captain."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,All evasion tactics carried out as ordered.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"It’s been useless, Captain."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, sir."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Attention.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"All personnel, attention."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Alien force has penetrated the ship.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Take defensive action.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Attention, all personnel."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,The alien being has penetrated the ship.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,Take defensive action.
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Sulu, Captain."
SULU,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Indications are a storm, Captain, although I've never seen one of such great intensity or strange confirmation."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,All sensor readings are at maximum calibration.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"It is definitely doing so, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Therefore it cannot be a phenomenon of nature.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Some equipment was temporarily out of order.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,My sensors were inoperative.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"None, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, it was not a storm."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Only of the result, not of the cause."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"In each case, a different area of the brain was affected."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Our voluntary nerve functions were under some form of pressure.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Attack might be a more precise formulation, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"It is of little consequence, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Memory Alpha has no protective shields.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"None, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"When the library complex was assembled, shielding was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Since the information on the Memory planet is available to everyone, special protection was deemed unnecessary."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"It varies with the number of scholars, researchers, and scientists from the various Federation planets who are using the computer complex."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,None.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"A disaster for the galaxy, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,The central brain is damaged.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,The memory core is burned out.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,The loss to the galaxy may be irretrievable.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"A very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Negative.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,The attack was thorough.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Lieutenant, I assure you that unexplained phenomenon was headed away from the planet."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,It is probably seeking other victims.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,No known conditions in space would support that type of natural phenomenon.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,I'm having difficulty with the ship's sensors.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,They seem to be under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants of Memory Alpha were.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Ship's sensors are operating at the moment.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Perhaps the elusive creature will now reveal something about itself.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Maintaining its distance.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"However, it is matching each manoeuvre we execute, and I am receiving increasing magnitude of energy."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Not what is it, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,What are they?
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"There are ten distinct life units within it, all powerfully alive and vital."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Impossible to determine without programming for computer analysis.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,I do not believe the Enterprise shields would prove an effective defence.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, we are dealing with a community of life units."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Their attack is in the form of brain waves directed against the brain, which is most compatible."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Perhaps it did not understand.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,It appears so.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Not directly.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,I have not been able to gather sufficient data for that.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, there is only one possible defence."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,If we can find an environment which is deadly to the alien form.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"I am, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,I have fed all obtainable data to the main computer.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,It should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are possible.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Doctor McCoy, according to your records, Lieutenant Romaine showed no abnormal telepathic powers."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,And you are sure that this is the correct slide?
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Gentlemen, it also happens to be tape H, the impulse tracking obtained from the alien life units."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"As I said, Captain, this is the tracking obtained during the last shielded run."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Computer, run a detailed comparison brain circuitry patterns, tape D and tape H."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Fascinating.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,There is an identity of minds taking place between the alien beings and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Their thoughts are becoming hers.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"At their present force, they will get through the shields this time, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has planned."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, we must deal with them directly, now, while she still retains partial identity."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,We can speak to them.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,They will answer using her voice.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was destroyed.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,They will not accept their own deaths.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Captain, if we cannot complete the plan, they will carry out their threat."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,The weightless state has become their natural condition.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"We may tax Mister Scott's patience, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Particularly where humans are involved, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"While the truth was difficult to accept, when it was revealed, the girl reacted well."
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,I would say her struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,"You mean, love as motivation?"
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Humans do claim a great deal for that particular emotion.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,I suppose it is possible.
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,However
SPOCK,The Lights Of Zetar,Logical.
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Condition yellow, sir."
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,"All stations are operative, sir."
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,Captain.
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,"During the disturbance, Memory Alpha was hailing."
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,"I wanted to respond, but I couldn't make my hand move."
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Sir, I'm unable to establish contact with the planetoid."
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,I'm hailing on all frequencies.
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,No response.
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,"I'm sorry, sir."
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,I can't break through this interference.
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,All channels open.
UHURA,The Lights Of Zetar,Translator tied in.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,Was she hurt by the fall or the action of the disturbance?
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Well, I think she's coming around now."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,You let me be the judge of that.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,Do you feel like walking to Sickbay?
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Are the readings corresponding, Nurse?"
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,Thank you.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Lieutenant, there are four hundred and thirty people aboard this ship."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"You're the only one that passed out, and I want to know why."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,This whole thing is a new experience for all of us.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Well, if we can get on with this, Scotty, we might make that determination."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Now then, tell me."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,What did you feel before you passed out?
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,Nothing?
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,Lieutenant
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Lieutenant, you're being completely unco-operative!"
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"I'll put the facts into your record, if I can get them."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,Perhaps you can explain to her that any career she hopes for in Starfleet requires discipline and co-operation.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"McCoy here, Jim."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,I think she's in good shape.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Somehow, I find transporting into the darkness unnerving."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Over here, Captain!"
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Not a thing, Jim."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,(the woman's mouth is moving) The same garbled sounds Lieutenant Romaine made when she fainted after the storm.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,Absolutely sure.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,She's dead.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Severe brain haemorrhaging due to distortion of all neural systems, dissolution of autonomic nervous system."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"All basic personality factors, Captain."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Each had a different centre of brain destroyed, cause unknown."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, Captain."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,I can be more detailed when we return to the ship and use the ship's computers.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,We found one person in there just barely alive.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"The rest were dead, and we"
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, Captain."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,I can have her ready in a few minutes.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Go easy on her, Jim."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,She's in a pretty bad state.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,Of course you didn't.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,I told the Captain.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Romaine, Mira."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,Lieutenant.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Place of birth, Martian Colony Number Three."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Parents, Lydia Romaine, deceased."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Jacques Romaine, chief engineer, Starfleet, retired."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, Captain."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,Occasional and teenage routine incidents.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,None.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"No, Captain, not empathic."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"However, an extremely flexible and pliant response to new learning situations is highly marked."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"After our phasers hit that thing, I gave Lieutenant Romaine a standard Steinman analysis."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,The results might be interesting.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"The comparison of our Steinman with Starfleet records shows that Lieutenant Romaine's fingerprints, voice analysis, all external factors remain exactly the same as before."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"However, according to two hyperencephalograms, her brain wave pattern has been altered."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,That's what I was taught.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,But the BCP is just as consistent as fingerprints.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"That's right, Spock."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,But exceptional pliancy was indicated.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,That might be a factor.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"That is tape deck D, brain circuitry pattern of Lieutenant Mira Romaine."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,Nurse Chapel followed this every step of the way.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,There can be no error.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,There has been no error.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,She could kill us all in this state.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,The girl’s life reading is becoming a match to the Zetarians.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,She's losing.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Jim, you realize the pressure needed to kill the Zetars might kill the girl too."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,The Zetars are growing stronger.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"The pressure is dangerously high, Captain."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,It may damage her.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"We've done it, Jim."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,They're gone.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Reduce the pressure very, very gradually, Spock."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Lie perfectly still, Lieutenant."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,Try not to move at all.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Take deep, regular breaths."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Now, don't hold it."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,Continue to breathe deeply.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"In, out."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"In, out."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,That's it.
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Now, you'll be in there another twenty minutes, so why don't you just try to relax?"
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions are hazardous."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"However, despite Starfleet judgment of the pliancy of the Lieutenant, she put up a valiant struggle to retain her identity, and I find that encouraging."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"There are no howevers about it, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"It was a factor, and it will be a factor in the girl's recovery."
MCCOY,The Lights Of Zetar,"Well, I should think work would be a better therapy."
CHAPEL,The Lights Of Zetar,"Everything appears normal, Doctor."
CHAPEL,The Lights Of Zetar,Recording your responses in this computer.
CHAPEL,The Lights Of Zetar,"Lieutenant, please."
CHAPEL,The Lights Of Zetar,"With a bedside manner like that, Scotty, you're in the wrong business."
KYLE,The Lights Of Zetar,Something's interfering with the transporter signal.
KYLE,The Lights Of Zetar,"I have her co-ordinates, but she's suspended in transit."
COMPUTER,The Lights Of Zetar,"Comparison tape D's brain circuitry patterns of Lieutenant Mira Romaine and tape H, brain circuitry patterns of alien life unit, identical."
COMPUTER,The Lights Of Zetar,Identical.
CREWMAN,The Lights Of Zetar,"Medical lab here, sir."
SECURITY,The Lights Of Zetar,General quarters.
SECURITY,The Lights Of Zetar,Security condition three.
SECURITY,The Lights Of Zetar,Intruder alert.
SECURITY,The Lights Of Zetar,Repeat.
SECURITY,The Lights Of Zetar,General quarters.
SECURITY,The Lights Of Zetar,Security condition three.
SECURITY,The Lights Of Zetar,Intruder alert.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,(through Mira) She cannot stop us.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,You cannot prevent it.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, we understand you."
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,We have searched for a millennium for one through whom we can see and speak and hear and live out our lives.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,We are from Zetar.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,"Yes, all corporeal life was destroyed."
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,"The desires, the hopes, the mind and the will of the last hundred of Zetar."
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,The force of our life could not be wiped out.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,At the proper time.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,Our planet was dying.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,We were determined to live on.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,"At the peak of our plans to go, a sudden final disaster struck us down."
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,But the force of our lives survived.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,At last we have found someone through whom we can live it out.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,She will accept ours.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,Her mind will accept our thoughts.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,Our lives will be fulfilled.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,We did not wish to kill.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,No.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,Resisting us killed those people.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,We did not kill them.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,We only want the girl.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,Do not fight us.
ZETAR,The Lights Of Zetar,You will all die.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"(dictating) At Federation orders, we're proceeding at top warp speed to the planet Ardana, where the only source of zenite exists."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,It is the one substance that can halt the plague.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,On Stratos?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"That's their cloud city, isn't it, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,There must be some mistake.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Do you have the co-ordinates to the mine entrance available?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Kirk to transporter room.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Mister Scott, are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their cloud city, Stratos?"
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Fine.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Uhura.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Tell the High Advisor that we request to dispense with the welcoming ceremonies due to the emergency, and that we're beaming directly down to the mine entrance in order to ensure the fastest possible delivery of the zenite."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,The need is urgent.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Mister Spock, come with me."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Oh, and tell them that we appreciate the honour and that we look forward to some visit in the future."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Looks as tranquil as its reputation, doesn't it."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Once.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I didn't have time to look around.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Yes, art is the population's chief occupation."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,There's the mine entrance.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,The zenite consignment should have been there.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I don't understand it.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Those Troglyte miners were supposed to have made delivery when we beamed down.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Perhaps.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Who are you?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,What's the meaning of this attack?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,We're here by permission of your government council on an emergency mission.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"No, just a little shaken up."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Captain Kirk, Enterprise."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"My first officer, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,It was rather warm.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Well, I'm more concerned with the zenite consignment."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Why wasn't it in its specified location?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,They agreed to the delivery.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Your council assured us of it.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Hostages?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,For what purpose?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Very well.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"I do hope the search will be brief, Mister Advisor."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Pleasure, madam."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,What are their demands?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the delivery of zenite to Merak Two.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I hope so.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Ardana is a member of the Federation, and it is your council's responsibility that nothing interferes with its obligation to another member of the Federation."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,You again!
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Yes, duty is a good teacher."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I see you've changed your dressmaker.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,So you can attack me again?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,That would be foolish.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I'm not afraid.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"In fact, I find this rather enjoyable."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"All right, I'll make a deal with you."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,You answer some questions and I'll let you up.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Your word first.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Spock?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Then why this?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"No, not at all."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,In fact her visit was quite enlightening.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Yes, it seems the Troglytes are under the impression that the Enterprise is here to intimidate them."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"We're here to get that zenite consignment, and that's it."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"In times of emergency, they do anything."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"And believe me, this botanical plague is an emergency."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Unaccustomed to light and warmth?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,That's necessary to all humanoids.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Surely, you don't deny it to the Troglytes."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"They can be taught to understand, especially in a society that prides itself in enlightenment."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Yes, I should have realised."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Mister Advisor!
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"You said you were going to question Vanna, not torture her."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Surely there are better methods than this.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Yes, but I won't stand by while someone is tortured!"
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,The abstract concepts of loyalty and leadership seem clear to Vanna.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,But obviously no more consideration.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,The only way you'll use that device again is on one of us.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Of course, but Starfleet command won't take kindly to having either rays or physical force used against one of its command personnel, Mister Advisor."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Beyond plain humanitarianism, my orders are to get that zenite."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,You won't get it through torture.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Mister Scott, we're ready to beam up."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Lieutenant Uhura, advise Starfleet command that the zenite has not been delivered."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"In my opinion, Plasus' method of accomplishing delivery will not succeed."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"If the zenite is not delivered shortly, I shall have to violate Plasus' order of non-interference and win the confidence of the Troglyte leader with the use of reason."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"That's impossible, Bones."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"The Troglytes have accepted personal sacrifice, a common cause."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Mentally inferior beings aren't capable of that.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Natural growths?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,What kind?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,And the mines are full of that gas.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Bones, the Disrupters, Vanna."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,It seems impossible.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"They've outwitted a highly organised, scientific culture for months."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Does the brain return to normal?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Can you neutralise the gas?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Find one.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Meet us in the transporter room.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"This mask automatically eliminates all substance injurious to humanoid life, chemical as well as bacterial."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,We have used these filter masks frequently on
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Doctor McCoy has analysed the zenite thoroughly.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,We've checked his findings through the computer and they're absolutely valid.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,There's no time to argue about the findings now.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I simply propose to tell Vanna all about them.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,This nonsense might mean a great deal to the Troglytes.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I would like to offer them a supply of these filter masks in exchange for the zenite consignment.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Are you afraid the filter masks will work?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Is that why you don't want the Troglytes to try them?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I am here to get that zenite.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"If these will help me get them, I'll use them."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,My diplomacy is somewhat inadequate.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Doesn't give us much choice, does it."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Beam me down to Vanna's confinement quarters.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"If Vanna doesn't have something definite to gain for her people, she'll die rather than turn over that zenite consignment."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,This is the only thing that might convince her.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"If you’re about to suggest that you contact Vanna, the answer is negative, Spock."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"That goes for you too, Bones."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Officially, yes."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,But this mission is strictly unofficial.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Nobody's to have any part in it, any responsibility for it, but myself."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"That's an order, Spock."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,You have the conn.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Stand by till I contact you.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Vanna, I've brought you a gift."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,There's a dangerous gas in the mines that affects the development of the Troglytes exposed to it for a period of time.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,This mask will prevent any further damage.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Yes.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,That's true.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,But an idea can't be seen or felt.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"That's what's kept the Troglytes in the mines all these centuries, a mistaken idea."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Yes.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I'll see to it that the Federation engineers construct them.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Plasus is not the whole government.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"As soon as the zenite is delivered to Merak Two, I'll come back."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I'll request permission to mediate for the Troglytes.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Vanna, you must trust me."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I give you my word.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,The zenite can be delivered in a few hours.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,You won't have long to wait now.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Vanna, you must trust me."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"If you don't, millions of people will die."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,A whole planet.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,This zenite is all that can save them.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,This filter mask is all that can save the Troglytes.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Trust me.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Please.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,(wearing the mask) We had a bargain.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Why did you break it?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I trusted you.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Then you are a fool.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"These masks will free you, just as I said."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Holding me won't help you.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,My men'll still come for that zenite consignment.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,They'll still come.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Without that mask, I haven't"
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,It takes a while for its effects to be noticed.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Is that what Disrupters are bargaining for, the right to kill everyone?"
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,The masks can change that.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"How long do you plan on keeping me here, providing Midro doesn't kill me, of course?"
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,That's quite a while.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Longer than I expected.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Completely.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Die from something that can't be seen?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"You astound me, Vanna."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Nothing.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Are you locked in on me?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Circumstances dictate a slight variation, Spock."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Hold on these co-ordinates.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Locate the High Advisor and beam him to these co-ordinates immediately.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Without advance communication.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Repeat, without advance communication."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Have you got that, Spock?"
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I am preparing a demonstration on the effects of unbelieved gas.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Not until you're convinced of the effects of the zenite gas, Mister Advisor."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Perhaps you need closer exposure.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Fill that container.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I insist.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"You too, Vanna."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,You too!
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Dig!
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,What is it?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Your orders are to stand by.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Now, carry them out!"
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Kirk out.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,We'll leave when the gas has effect.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Dig!
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I said dig!
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,One more step and I'll kill you.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Both will kill.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,The zenite gas.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Well, it seems my little demonstration was quite a success."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,They will be very effective.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,sir.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"They've been severely tested, and the Troglytes will no longer suffer from retardation and emotional difficulties."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Thank you, Vanna."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Perhaps some form of mediation can be helpful in your difficulties.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,The Federation Bureau of Industrialisation may be of aid to you.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Believe me, sir, I have neither the time nor the desire to return here."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Only answering your charges against me will force me back.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,You're guilty of attacking a starship commander and plotting against his life.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"Yes, Vanna."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,They never happened.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Mister Advisor?
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,"(Plasus nods) Mister Spock, let's get that zenite delivered."
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,I believe we only have three hours left.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,The Cloud Minders,Mister Scott beam us up.
UHURA,The Cloud Minders,"Captain, the High Advisor of Ardana is ready to receive you on Stratos, sir."
UHURA,The Cloud Minders,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,The Cloud Minders,"Aye, sir."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"It is, Captain."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"They've already been provided to the transport officer, Captain."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Along with those of the council chamber of the High Advisor.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Stratos, Captain."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,A city actually floating in the sky.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,It is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Have you ever visited here, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,I've never had the opportunity.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"However, I hear its art forms are incomparable."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,It is a totally intellectual society.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,All forms of violence have been eliminated.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Perhaps there is another entrance, Captain."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,It would seem the Troglytes have changed their minds about delivery.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Greetings, Mister Advisor."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,The Disrupters?
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Who are they?
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Remarkable.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,The finest example of sustained antigravity elevation I've ever seen.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Nor I a work of art, madam."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Despoil?
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,For what purpose?
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Mister Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that planet."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed, the humanoid life will follow."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,But why do they destroy art forms?
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,That is a loss to everyone.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"That would be most welcome, Mister Advisor."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,This troubled planet is a place of the most violent contrasts.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Those who receive the rewards are totally separated from those who shoulder the burdens.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,It is not a wise leadership.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Here on Stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"The High Advisor's charming daughter Droxine, particularly so."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,The name Droxine seems appropriate for her.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"I wonder, can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind and be aware of the life of the people on the surface of the planet?"
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"There, the harsh life in the mines is instilling the people with a bitter hatred."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,The young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down was filled with the violence of desperation.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"If the lovely Droxine knew of the young miner's misery, I wonder how the knowledge would affect her."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Your movements awakened me.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Only Vulcan ears would find the noise discernible.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,The same may be said of Stratos inhabitants.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,We do pride ourselves on our logic.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,The seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all Vulcan’s.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"At that time, the mating drive outweighs all other motivations."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing, madam."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Am I intruding, Captain?"
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"In other words, they perform all the physical toil necessary to maintain Stratos."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,But they are not allowed to share its advantages.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,The surface of the planet is almost unendurable.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,To restrict a segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable in an evolved culture.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient Earth term.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Its technical translation is cave dweller.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Violence in reality is quite different from theory, is it not, madam?"
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"All the little things you and I understand and expect from life, such as equality, kindness, justice."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,But they're all the same species.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Those who live on Stratos and those who live below all originated on the planet.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Their physical and mental evolution must be similar.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,That is basic biological law.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Incredible.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there is danger of plant bacteria.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,No side effects have ever been reported.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"As part of the staff of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure for a long period."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"It is likely that without such exposure, the effect slowly wears off."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Unequal evolution did not begin until after your ancestors removed themselves from constant exposure to the gas, Mister Advisor."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Nor much time.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,We have ten hours and forty minutes to deliver that consignment to Merak Two.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Captain, if you are apprehended deliberately violating the High Advisor's orders, he will be within his rights to have you executed, if he chooses."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Allow me to point out that a first officer is more expendable than either a doctor or a captain.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Spock here.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"We've been trying to make contact, Captain."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Is anything wrong?
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Locked in and ready to beam up consignment.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Standing by for instructions.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Instructions clear.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,I shall carry them out immediately.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Spock out.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"That's not an exact quote, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"However, it does express the thought."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,You will have that opportunity.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Now that is an exact quote, Mister Scott, and I suggest you handle the transporter yourself."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,This could be very delicate as a problem in transporting for us and in diplomacy for the captain.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Spock here.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,You'll have to delay.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Picking up two life-forms in the gallery.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,They are inseparably close to one another.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,We cannot transport one
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Without the other.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Precisely, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Until the High Advisor is alone or can be isolated, the captain will have to wait."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Unless you have an alternative?
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Spock to transporter room.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Lock in on Council Gallery co-ordinates.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Energise.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"How are you doing, Mister Scott?"
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Beam him down to Captain Kirk immediately.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Good work, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,The captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Contact check, Captain."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,It has been over an hour since your last communication.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Standing by, Captain."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"However, let me remind you, we have only five hours left to"
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,That is very unlike the captain.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Enterprise, Spock here."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Captain, the zenite gas has affected you."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,Captain!
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,The zenite gas!
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"It is less technical, therefore less accurate, but perhaps more generally descriptive of the function."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"There is great beauty in the knowledge that lies below, and only one way to really experience it."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,No.
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"No, Vulcan is quite different."
SPOCK,The Cloud Minders,"Two hours, fifty-nine minutes to be exact, Captain."
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,"Ready to transport, Captain."
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,The mine entrance.
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,"That's what you ordered, Captain."
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,"Enterprise, Captain."
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,"Beam the High Advisor down without warning, did he say?"
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,I'd like to see the Advisor's face.
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,"The captain did say immediately, did he not?"
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,Aye.
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,Transporter room to Mister Spock.
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,I've locked into the co-ordinates of the Cloud City Council Gallery.
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,Ready to transport the High Advisor.
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,What's wrong?
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,Did you say the word immediately was an exact quote of the captain's order?
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,"Well, are we going to do anything about it?"
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,I’ll give it further thought.
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,Scott here.
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,"Locked in, sir."
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,Energising.
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,"Fine, Mister Spock."
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,The High Advisor's materialising on the platform.
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,"Energising, sir."
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,He's on his way to the captain.
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,The Advisor looked mighty angry.
SCOTT,The Cloud Minders,I hope he doesn't give the captain too much trouble.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"(a woman in blue) Interference breeds attack, Captain."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Come on!
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Move on, Captain!."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"You sleep lightly, Captain."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Release me.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Call the guards if you’re afraid, Captain."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,I do not!
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,What questions?
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,I will answer.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"I did not come here to kill you, Captain."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,To take you hostage.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Droxine.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,To welcome our honoured guests as I was taught to do when I served in your father's household.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"It is not impression, Captain."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,It is the truth.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Starships do not transport cargo.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Lies will not keep the Troglytes in the caverns, and neither will your starship."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,I speak for my people.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,They have as much right to the clouds as the Stratos dwellers.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Live in the sunlight and warmth, as everyone should."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,There are no Disrupters!
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Gas from zenite?
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,It's hard to believe something which is neither seen nor felt can do so much harm.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Would all the Troglytes wear these masks?
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Suppose Plasus does not agree?
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"That is true, but the city council will not listen to Troglytes."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Centuries ago, Stratos was built by leaders that gave their word that all inhabitants would live there."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,The Troglytes are still waiting.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Hours can be centuries, just as words can be lies."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Very well, Captain."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,I will trust you.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,The consignment lies deep in the mines in a place known only to Troglytes.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,I cannot direct you.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,I must take you there.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"You asked for my trust, Captain."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Are you unwilling to give yours?
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,It's the sentinel with my refreshment.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Wait.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,We'll need a transport pass to leave the city.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Midro.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Anka.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,And I've brought with me a hostage.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Seize him!
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Did you really think I would trust you, Captain?"
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,I'm not such a fool.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,You thought you would trick me with your talk of your filter and your unseen gas.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,I don't believe you any more than Plasus does.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Our weapons are our freedom.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,And you’ve just furnished me with two very valuable ones.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Yourself and this.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,(phaser)
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Without your communicator, you will be hard to locate."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Perhaps.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"In the meantime, a taste of our existence, Captain."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Dig as the Troglytes do.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,As the Troglytes do.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"With your bare hands, Captain."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"You dig well, Captain."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,The unseen gas doesn't seem to be harming you.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Nevertheless, you won't be needing this."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Anka, deposit this on the transport platform so Plasus will know we have something more valuable to bargain with than our mortaes and thongs."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Searchers will be coming soon, Midro."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Go to the other mines and tell the Troglytes to post watchers.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,I will see that he doesn't escape.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"A dead hostage is of no value, Midro."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,I brought him here and I will say what is to be done.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Can you do nothing but argue?
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,The searchers will be here soon.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Midro is a child.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Return to the digging, Captain."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Until we have help in the mines and our homes are in the clouds.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,We're sealed in!
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,But soon the atmosphere will go.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,We'll die.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,You would seal Plasus here also?
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,For what purpose?
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,I grow faint.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,The oxygen is going.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,The gas!
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Captain, you were right."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,It's taking effect!
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Captain, you were right!"
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Enterprise!
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Enterprise, help!"
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Enterprise!
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,They'll kill each other.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Help us.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Help us!
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Enterprise!
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Enterprise!
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"The captain will have his zenite, just as I agreed."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,The captain will have his zenite.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Because it is the only way we can obtain what is due us.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,It served your purpose at the time.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Yes.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,Our demands have just begun.
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Here is the zenite, Captain, just as I promised."
VANNA,The Cloud Minders,"Captain, perhaps both incidents are best forgotten."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Troglytes, halt!"
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Surrender or we'll fire!
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Are you harmed, gentlemen?"
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"I'm Plasus, High Advisor of the planet council."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,My regrets for the unpleasantness of your welcome to Ardana.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Unfortunately, violence is habitual with the Troglytes."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"But I assure you, this insult will not go unpunished."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Apparently the Disrupters have confiscated it, as I knew they would."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,A small group of Troglyte malcontents.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,All the other Troglytes are completely dominated by them.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,It's the Disrupters who are responsible for their refusal to continue mining for zenite.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,They agreed obviously as a ruse to get valuable hostages.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,To force the council to meet their demands.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,(to guards) Organise a search party immediately and find the zenite consignment.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Meanwhile, Captain, I would suggest that you and First Officer Spock be our guests on Stratos."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,We'll do everything possible to make it so.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Come, gentlemen."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,A most gracious act.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,One of our planet's most incomparable works of art.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"My daughter, Droxine."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Captain James Kirk.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,And First Officer Spock.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Come, gentlemen."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,There is much to see in our city.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,This is our council gallery.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,It is open to all city dwellers.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,We have some of the finest of our various art forms assembled here for the viewing and contemplation of every
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Disrupters again.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"By keeping us in constant turmoil, they hope to force the council to accede to their demands."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Completely unreasonable, Captain, but nothing you need be concerned with."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"I assure you, gentlemen, you will get what you came for."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Of course, and we accept the responsibility."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Art means nothing to the Disrupters.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,This (the dagger) is the only form they understand.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,The disturbances accompanying your arrival have been most wearying.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,No doubt you would like to rest.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Chambers have been prepared for you.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,A sentinel will guide you to them.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,It's fortunate that they were not seriously hurt.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Further violence could create grave difficulties between Ardana and the Federation.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,They grow more daring and determined every day.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Now they seek to find allies in the galaxy.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,All this time I thought you were worried about our diplomatic relations.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Remove his shields.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"What is your business in Stratos, Troglyte?"
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Speak!
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,I command you!
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Repair what?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Indeed.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Then you must have a repair permit.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Where is it?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Did you also forget your transport card?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,And where was your cavern implement lost?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Could this perhaps be it?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,And you shall make them by giving us the names of the Disrupters.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,I would advise you to increase your knowledge.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Secure him to the rostrum.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,How unfortunate.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,How unfortunate.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,You still refuse to disclose the names of the other Disrupters.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Very well, if you prefer the rays."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"She's stubborn, and as you yourself pointed out, Captain, the search for your zenite consignment must be short."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Physical discomfort is extremely persuasive, Captain."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Is it preferable to spare Vanna and allow an entire planet to be destroyed?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Troglytes are not like Stratos dwellers, Mister Spock."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,They're a conglomerate of inferior species.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,The abstract concepts of an intellectual society are beyond their comprehension.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,A few Troglytes are brought here as retainers.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Vanna was one of them, as are the sentinels."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,They've received more training than the others.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,I fail to see the purpose of this continued criticism.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"An imposing display of primitive gallantry, gentlemen."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"You realise, of course, that the sentinels could remove you."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Why are you so concerned with this Disrupter's well-being?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Then stop interfering, and I'll get it for you."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"We will get it for you, and in our own way."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Remove the prisoner to confinement quarters.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,You will return to your ship at once or I shall contact your Starfleet command myself and report your interference with this planet's government.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"(to sentinel) If Captain Kirk appears again, kill him."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Do you really expect me to believe that that mask can achieve intellectual equality for the Troglytes?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,How can a mere filter accomplish what centuries of evolution have failed to do?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"And do your computers explain how my ancestors, who also dwelt in caverns, evolved sufficiently to erect Stratos while the Troglytes did not?"
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Preposterous.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,I doubt whether even Vanna will believe such nonsense!
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"I'm sorry, Captain."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Such an offer could only cause more unrest among them.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,I cannot allow it until our scientists have checked the findings.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"You are here to complete an emergency mission, not conduct tests, Captain."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,And I forbid it.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Your Federation orders do not entitle you to defy local governments.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,This communication has ended.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Something's upsetting you, Droxine."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,What is it?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Tell me.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,He will never return.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,I've seen to that.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,It will be delivered.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"If we have to kill every Troglyte, it will be delivered."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,He knows nothing except how to destroy our power and our society.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"I forbid you ever to speak of Captain Kirk, or even to think of him."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Oh, he's no better than his friend."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,What is it?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Where is Captain Kirk?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,This is the kind of reason they use to persuade us.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,I will hear no more defence of them.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Leave here at once.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Go to your music.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Abduction of a planet official is a serious crime.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"You will pay for this, I promise you."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,What effects?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,I've been here nearly an hour of your Earth time.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,You and Vanna even longer.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,I see no changes in any of us!
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Are you suggesting that I dig zenite?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,You will indeed pay for this.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,She's right.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"Kirk, transport us out of here."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,It will never take effect.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Transport us out of here!
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Imbecile!
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,We'll die!
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,I am High Advisor of all the planet.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,I will take no more orders!
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Are you as brave with mortae as you are with a phaser?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,It appears you have what you came for after all.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Agreed?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,There's no such word in the Troglyte vocabulary.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,No thanks to any agreement by you.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,It had to be obtained by force.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,How about your education?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,Was that by force?
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,You could have had those filters for all the good it will do you.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,They will all be like her.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"ungrateful, vindictive."
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,I will tolerate absolutely no interference!
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,You will not set foot here as long as I rule!
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,And I shall press them.
PLASUS,The Cloud Minders,"You are guilty of abduction, Captain!"
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"The sentinel told me of our honoured guests, my father."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,I came to extend greetings.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"Indeed, yes, Captain."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"I have never before met a Vulcan, sir."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,How dreadful!.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,They're despoiling the whole city.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,I'm sorry they were so poorly treated on their first visit to our planet.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"Oh, yes, that would have been dreadful."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,The Disrupters must be mad to attack two such charming strangers.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,Do you think that Captain Kirk and his very attractive officer will feel that we're responsible for their injuries?
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"Mister Spock, I thought you had accompanied Captain Kirk to the rest chamber."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,My apologies.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,I did not realise they would disturb you.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,It seems that Vulcans are fascinatingly different in many ways.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,Vulcan eyes are very discerning too.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"I hear that, intellectually, Vulcans are as highly evolved as Stratos city dwellers."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,You only take a mate once every seven years?
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"And is there nothing that can disturb that cycle, Mister Spock?"
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,Vanna!
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,Why have you come here?
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"Has she injured you, Captain?"
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,Oh?
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,(into intercom) Send a sentinel to the rest chamber immediately.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"You talk like a Disrupter, Vanna."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,But Stratos is for advisors and studiers.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,What would Troglytes do here?
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"The caverns are warm and your eyes are not accustomed to light, just as your minds are not accustomed to logic."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"The Troglytes are workers, Captain."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"Oh surely, you must be aware of that."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"They mine zenite for shipment, till the soil."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,Those things cannot be done here.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,That is their function in our society.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,How can they share what they do not understand?
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"The complete separation of toil and leisure has given Ardana this perfectly balanced social system, Captain."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,Why should we change it?
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"The surface is marred by violence, like the Troglytes."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"But here in Stratos, we have completely eliminated violence."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"But what else can they understand, Mister Spock?"
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"No, Father."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"No, really."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,I'm not upset.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,I was just standing here looking into space and wondering whether or not he would return.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,But the zenite is so important to him.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,He must have it.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"By that time, it may be too late."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,Perhaps he does have a method
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"No, I wasn't thinking of Captain Kirk."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,It's the one with those exquisitely shaped ears.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,His name is Spock.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,He's the one I was thinking about.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,Did you know that he has the most incredibly sensitive hearing?
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"Why, I almost believe that if I stood here and called out to him, he would hear my invitation to come and visit with us for a little while longer."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,Shall we try?
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,They are desperate.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,I'm sure Mister Spock would not behave so.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"Father, are we so sure of our methods that we never question what we do?"
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"I don't like filters, or even masks."
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,"I like the word protector much better, don't you?"
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,Stratos is so pleasant and so beautiful.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,I think I'm afraid to leave it.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,I shall go to the mines.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,I no longer wish to be limited to the clouds.
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,Is your planet like this one?
DROXINE,The Cloud Minders,Someday I should like to visit it.
SENTINEL,The Cloud Minders,"Apologies, Mister Advisor, but this Troglyte was apprehended leaving the city."
SENTINEL,The Cloud Minders,He is without a transport card so we thought you would want to question him.
SENTINEL,The Cloud Minders,The Disrupter Vanna has disappeared.
SENTINEL,The Cloud Minders,Her guard was found half unconscious.
SENTINEL,The Cloud Minders,He'd been attacked by Captain Kirk.
SENTINEL,The Cloud Minders,"He did not know, sir."
SENTINEL,The Cloud Minders,He did not regain his senses until I came to his aid.
TROGLYTE,The Cloud Minders,My business is to repair.
TROGLYTE,The Cloud Minders,There are damaged entrance panels.
TROGLYTE,The Cloud Minders,It was forgotten.
TROGLYTE,The Cloud Minders,It was lost when your sentinels attacked me.
TROGLYTE,The Cloud Minders,I came to make repairs.
TROGLYTE,The Cloud Minders,I know nothing.
TROGLYTE,The Cloud Minders,That is not possible for a Troglyte.
TROGLYTE,The Cloud Minders,The Stratos city dwellers have said it.
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,"That may not be easy, Jim."
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,Medical analysis indicates the Troglytes are mentally inferior.
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,"Look, I've checked my findings thoroughly."
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,Their intellect ratings are almost twenty percent below average.
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,"That's true, Spock, but obviously the ancestors of those who live on Stratos removed themselves from the environment of the mines."
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,Therefore they avoided the effects of certain natural growths.
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,Well.
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,I had this zenite sample sent up from the surface.
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,"Now unsealed, it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here."
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,There are none after it’s refined.
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,"But in its raw state, it emits a odourless, invisible gas that retards the intellectual functioning of the mind and heightens the emotional."
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,"Therefore, it releases a violent reaction."
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,That's right.
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,And the Troglytes are constantly exposed to it.
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,"That's right, Spock."
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,The other Disrupters were probably removed from exposure too.
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,"According to findings, it should."
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,"No, but a filter mask should remove the exposure."
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,"There's every indication that the effect of the gas is temporary, even after repeated exposure."
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,But that could take days.
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,It's pretty hard to overcome prejudice.
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,You mean you're going back to Stratos against government orders?
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,Can the zenite be affecting him?
MCCOY,The Cloud Minders,"Look out, Jim!"
MIDRO,The Cloud Minders,Vanna.
MIDRO,The Cloud Minders,What of him?
MIDRO,The Cloud Minders,"If we kill him, there will be no need to see."
MIDRO,The Cloud Minders,Only the Troglytes will know.
MIDRO,The Cloud Minders,You are not the only Disrupter.
MIDRO,The Cloud Minders,"I, too, can say."
MIDRO,The Cloud Minders,"When Anka returns, we will all say."
ANKA,The Cloud Minders,You have returned.
ANKA,The Cloud Minders,"You are clever, Vanna."
ANKA,The Cloud Minders,Very clever.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"It is definitely the stolen space cruiser, Captain, the Aurora."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,I read six aboard.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,I read no evidence of malfunction.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Their engines are seriously overheating, Captain."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Power approaching critical.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,They cannot continue.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Power beyond critical.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Explosion is imminent.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Captain, with your permission"
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,One.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,One is the beginning.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,I am not Herbert.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"If you will state your purpose and your objectives, perhaps we can arrive at a mutual understanding."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,I would prefer that you state it.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,What is your destination?
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Many myths are based on truth, Captain, and they are not unintelligent."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Their leader, Doctor Sevrin, is a man"
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Yes.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"A brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics, communications and electronics on Tiburon."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,He was dismissed from his post when he started this movement.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Tong Rad inherits his father's extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,There are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,It is almost a biological rebellion.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"A profound revulsion against the planned communities, the programming, the sterilised, artfully balanced atmospheres."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,They hunger for an Eden where spring comes.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Yes, that is true, Captain."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"It is not sympathy so much as curiosity, Captain."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,A wish to understand.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"They regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds, a condition with which I am somewhat familiar."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"It is somewhat uncomplimentary, Captain."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Herbert was a minor official notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"I shall make an attempt, Captain."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,They respect you.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,They will listen to your reasoning.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"For their sake, you must stop them."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Doctor Sevrin, I'm in a position to help you and your group."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,I can use the resources of the Enterprise to determine whether or not Eden actually exists and to plot its exact location.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,I can present a case to Federation to allow you and your group to colonise that planet.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Neither you nor your people are at present charged with a crime.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"However, incitement to disaffection is criminal."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,The Federation will never allow the colonisation of a planet by criminals.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"If they persist, they will be so charged and forever barred from Eden."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Then you knew you were a carrier.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,What I fail to understand is why you disobey those orders.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Your very presence will destroy the people you seek.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Surely you know that.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Yes, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Yes, Doctor."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Doctor Sevrin is insane.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"I've not consulted Doctor McCoy, but I have no doubt of it."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,His condition does not affect my interest in the movement.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,There is no insanity in what they seek.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,I made a promise which I should like to keep.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"With your permission, I must locate Eden."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,I shall work in my quarters.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,May I have the assistance of Mister Chekov in auxiliary control?
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Come in.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,No.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"If I understand you correctly, I believe the answer might be yes."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"I am not receiving, Mister Chekov."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Spock to Chekov.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Repeat, I am not receiving."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"He has the capability, Captain."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Negative.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Adam, there is a file on Doctor Sevrin in our computer banks."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,In it you'll find a report attesting to the fact
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,That he is a carrier of a bacillus strain known as Synthococcus novae.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"You'll also find a report from the same hospital, giving a full psychological profile on him and projecting these actions of his."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Adam.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,You know I reach you.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,I believe in what you seek.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,But there is a tragic difference between what you want and what he wants.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,We are within sensor range of Eden and continuing to approach.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"No, Captain, it hasn't stopped."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,It has gone beyond
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Captain, they're using"
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"(in pain) Captain, go."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,I.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,You must destroy the
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Ultrasonics.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,The panel.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Negative, Captain."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,However I am picking up the shuttlecraft.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,It has landed.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"Except for those aboard the craft, I read no life at all, either humanoid nor animal."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"The legends were true, Captain."
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Fantastically beautiful planet.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Captain.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,His name was Adam.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Stand by to beam aboard injured parties.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Medical team to the transporter room.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,Miss Galliulin.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,It is my sincere wish that you do not give up your search for Eden.
SPOCK,The Way To Eden,"I have no doubt but that you will find it, or make it yourselves."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Hailing frequencies.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Aurora, this is the USS Enterprise, Captain James T. Kirk commanding."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Acknowledge.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Aurora, this is the Enterprise."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Do you read me?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Repeat.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Federation orders to detain you for
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Change course.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Pursue and overtake.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Stand by tractor beams.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Engage.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Bring them in.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Aurora, cut power."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,You are overtaxing your ship.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Emergency power to tractor beams.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Bridge to Transporter room.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Scotty, are you ready to transport?"
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Are we within transportation range?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Aurora personnel, stand by to be transported aboard."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Energise.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Are they aboard?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Scotty, are they aboard?"
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Scotty, take them to the briefing room."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,What's going on?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Why?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"No, I'll be right down."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Which one of you is Tongo Rad?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,You can thank your father's influence for the fact you're not under arrest.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"In addition to piracy, you've left yourself open to charges of violating flight regulations, entering hostile space and endangering the lives of others as well as your own."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,In addition you've caused an interstellar incident which may have destroyed everything that's been negotiated between your planet and the Federation.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"If you have an explanation, I am prepared to hear it."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Mister Spock, take them to Sickbay for a medical check."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,There may have been radiation from the explosion.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,By all means.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,That planet it is a myth.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Well, whether you recognise authority or not, I am it on this ship."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,I am under orders to transport you back to Starbase peaceably.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,From there you'll be ferried to your various planets.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Because of my orders, you are not prisoners, but my guests."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,I expect you to behave as such.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Mister Spock, you seem to understand these people."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,You will deal with them.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"And after they are finished in Sickbay, see to it that they're escorted back to their proper quarters and given whatever care they need."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,I have orders to the contrary.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,This is not a passenger ship.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Lieutenant Palmer, notify Starbase we have the six aboard who stole the space cruiser Aurora."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Regrettably, the space cruiser itself was destroyed."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Personal note to the Catullan ambassador.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,His son is safe.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Yes, what is it?"
KIRK,The Way To Eden,One of those was in the Academy?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Do you wish to see her?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Permission to leave your post.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Are they in the Sickbay?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Mister Spock, do they really believe that Eden exists?"
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Doctor Sevrin is their leader?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Well.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,But they've rejected all that and all that this technology provides.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,And they seek the primitive.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,All do.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,The cave is deep in our memory.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,But we don't steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible children.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,What makes you so sympathetic toward them?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Spock.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,What does Herbert mean?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Well, I shall try to be less rigid in my thinking."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"What's going on, Bones?"
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Does he have it?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,What about the others?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Is the crew in danger?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Put him in isolation.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Yes, I'm ready."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Kirk to Security.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,I want a guard maintained on Doctor Sevrin until further notice.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Bones, how long before we know whether the crew has been endangered by this infection?"
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Mister Sulu.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Mister Sulu, explain."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Doctor Sevrin will be released when we think he is medically safe.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Yes, Scotty, what is it?"
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Thank you, Scotty."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Mister Spock, I don't seem to be able to communicate with these people."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Do you think you can persuade them to behave?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"If it weren't for that ambassador's son, they'd all be in the brig."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,I'll have Bones check him out.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Spock, I'm sorry."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,You had great respect for him.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,But it does explain some of what they've done.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Certainly.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Mister Chekov, assist Mister Spock."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Bridge to Sickbay.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Bones.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,I'd like to talk to you.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"I used to get into a little trouble when I was that age, Scotty."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Didn't you?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Bridge to auxiliary control.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Bridge to auxiliary control.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Can he do it?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Start a trace-back of all circuits.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,See if you can bypass him.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Any patrols?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,There will be soon.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Doctor Sevrin.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,You are violating Romulan space and endangering the peace of the galaxy.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,The Romulans will view this as a military intrusion and attack.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Bring the ship about now.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,If you bring her about
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"And return to Starbase, no charges will be leveled."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"If you do not, you will never reach Eden."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,You and this ship will be destroyed.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Adam.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Rad.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,You are being led by a man who is insane.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,You are being used by him.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Spock, you tell them."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Whatever they're going to do, they're going to do now."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,We have no choice.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Mister Spock, Mister Scott."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Spock!
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"It's all right, Spock."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,It stopped.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,What is it?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Kirk to Engineering.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Bridge?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Hangar deck?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Kirk to Transporter Room.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Kirk to Bridge.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Do you read me?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Come in.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Never mind.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Do we have control of the ship?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Can we break out of orbit if we have to?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Kirk here.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Stand by.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Do you read any Romulans?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Where?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Auxiliary control to Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Bones, are you all right?"
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Stand by, transporter room."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Full medical gear.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,No.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"No, they tried to destroy us."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Let them think they succeeded.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"I want the co-ordinates zeroed in so that when we beam down, we won't be visible to them."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Scotty, you have the conn."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"If any Romulans appear, try to make them understand."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,I do not want to provoke combat.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Mister Spock.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Mister Chekov, join us in the transporter room."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Is this what they believed they'd find?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Then I can understand.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Spread out.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Approach with caution.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,(into communicator) Doctor Sevrin.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,What is it?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Will our clothing protect us?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Bones?
KIRK,The Way To Eden,There's the shuttlecraft.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Here, we'll help you."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Doctor Sevrin.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Bones!
KIRK,The Way To Eden,We can help you aboard the ship.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Be sensible, Doctor."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Sevrin, don't!"
KIRK,The Way To Eden,You'll kill yourself!
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Stop!
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Alert them that we have the four and we're ready to beam them down.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,And mark the incident closed.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Bridge to Transporter.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Scotty, are they there?"
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Stand by.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Mister Chekov, do you wish to attend?"
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"Thank you, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,The Way To Eden,You did what you had to do.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,As did we all.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,Even your friends.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,You may go.
KIRK,The Way To Eden,"We reach, Mister Spock."
PALMER,The Way To Eden,"They are receiving us, Captain."
PALMER,The Way To Eden,"Aye, sir."
PALMER,The Way To Eden,"I have Starbase now, Captain."
PALMER,The Way To Eden,"Aye, sir."
SULU,The Way To Eden,"They're veering off, sir."
SULU,The Way To Eden,"Standing by, sir."
SULU,The Way To Eden,Tractor beam engaged.
SULU,The Way To Eden,"They've not cut power, sir."
SULU,The Way To Eden,They're struggling to escape.
SULU,The Way To Eden,How do you know what I want?
SULU,The Way To Eden,You make it tempting.
SULU,The Way To Eden,"No explanation, sir."
SULU,The Way To Eden,"Captain, I get no response from controls."
SULU,The Way To Eden,We're going off course.
SULU,The Way To Eden,"Captain, it seems as though someone else is running the ship."
SULU,The Way To Eden,"Captain, we're now leaving the Neutral Zone."
SULU,The Way To Eden,Bearing into Romulan space!
SULU,The Way To Eden,"Sulu here, Captain."
SULU,The Way To Eden,What happened to us?
SULU,The Way To Eden,"I heard a whistle, and then"
SULU,The Way To Eden,"I think so, sir."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"Aye, aye, sir."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"If it continues on course, it will enter Romulan space."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"Not yet, sir."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Irina?
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Captain.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"Sir, I believe I know one of them."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"At least, I think I recognise her voice."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Her name is Irina Galliulin.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,We were in Starfleet Academy together.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"Yes, sir."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,She dropped out.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,She
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"Thank you, sir."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Excuse me.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Is Irina Galliulin with you?
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Irina.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,You knew I was on the Enterprise?
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"Irina, why?"
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Come.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,How could you do this to yourself?
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,You were a scientist.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"And now, look at you."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Why did you do it?
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,I am proud of what I am.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,I believe in what I do.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Can you say that?
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Yes.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,You even talk like them.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Why did you go away?
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,I came back to look for you.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,I looked.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Where did you go?
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,You never felt as I did.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Never.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,You don't have it in you to feel so much.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"Even when we were close, you weren't with me."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,You were off thinking of something else.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Why did you stay away?
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Go to your friends.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Yes.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Auxiliary control.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"Should the main control room breakdown or suffer damage, we can navigate the ship from here."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,What do you want?
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,It does not matter.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Let us not discuss your beliefs.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Then why do you do such things?
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,I am assisting Mister Spock in locating your Eden.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,I am not.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"These tapes contain star charts, and we project the orbits of the various planets here."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"By mathematical process, we determine whether or not they are affected by other bodies not yet charted."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,What I do not know I find out from the computer banks.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"If, if I knew nothing at all, I could navigate the ship simply by studying what is stored in there."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,They contain the sum of all human knowledge.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,They solve our problems of navigation.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Of control.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Of life support.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,No.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,We use our own judgment also.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,You could never listen to anyone.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,You always had to be different.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"I am sorry, Mister Spock."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,I was momentarily delayed.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"No, sir."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Control is in auxiliary.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"Do you wish to open communication, sir?"
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,Eden.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"The flower, sir."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,I touched it.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,It's like fire.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"Captain, I wish first to apologise for my conduct during this time."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,I did not maintain myself under proper discipline.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,I endangered the ship and its personnel by my conduct.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,I respectfully submit myself for disciplinary action.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,"Thank you, sir."
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,I was coming to say goodbye.
CHEKOV,The Way To Eden,And you be correct.
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,"Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,"Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,"They are, and a nice lot too."
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,"They refuse, sir."
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,I don't know.
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,"They're sitting on the floor, the lot of them."
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,You can hear for yourself.
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,Shall I send for security?
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,Engineering to Bridge.
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,"Captain, I just had to give one of those barefooted what do you call 'ems the boot out of here."
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,"She came in bold as brass, tried to incite my crew to disaffect."
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,At least we know where they are and what they're doing.
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,I don't know why a young mind has to be an undisciplined one.
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,They're troublemakers.
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,It's shorted.
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,"No, it's channeled over somewhere."
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,To auxiliary control.
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,He’s got everything channelled over.
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,Enterprise here.
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,"Three of them, sir."
SCOTT,The Way To Eden,Expecting a fourth any minute.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"We are not in the mood, Herbert."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Pavel Andreievich.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,I had thought we might encounter each other.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,I had heard.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"Look at yourself, Pavel."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Why did you?
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Yes.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"Oh, we should not tear at each other so, Pavel."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,We should meet again in joy.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"Today when I first knew it was your ship that followed us, I thought of you and wondered what I would find."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,And I remembered so much.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"In spite of that uniform, I still see the same Pavel I used to know."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Are you happy in what you do?
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Then I accept what you do.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,It was you who went.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"I stayed in the city, with friends."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,I did.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"Because you disapproved of me, Just as you do now."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"Oh, Pavel, you have always been like this."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,So correct.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"And inside, the struggle not to be."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Give in to yourself.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,You will be happier.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,You'll see.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Am I allowed in?
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"I have been looking for you, Pavel."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,What room is this?
IRINA,The Way To Eden,What's it for?
IRINA,The Way To Eden,To apologise.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,I should not have teased you.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,It was cruel.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"Oh, but it does."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,It is against everything I believe in.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"And I do not like having you angry with me, or disapproving."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,What are you working on?
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"Oh, now you are teasing me."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Do you know all these things?
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"They tell you what to do, and you do what they tell you."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,I could never obey a computer.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Not different.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,What I wanted to be.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,There is nothing wrong in doing what you want.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Everything can be handled from auxiliary control.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,The computers contain all the information we need.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,We can do it.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Pavel said they would.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Our original course must have been somewhat in error.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,What will that do to them?
IRINA,The Way To Eden,What is it?
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"Sound pitched that high doesn't stun, it destroys."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,I remember when we read in the text that it
IRINA,The Way To Eden,It was so beautiful.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,And I was coming to say goodbye to you.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,"(a kiss) Be incorrect, occasionally."
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Occasionally.
IRINA,The Way To Eden,Thank you.
MAN,The Way To Eden,Tell Herbert it's no go.
ALL,The Way To Eden,No go.
ALL,The Way To Eden,No go.
ALL,The Way To Eden,"No go, no go, no go."
ALL,The Way To Eden,"No go, no go, no go."
ALL,The Way To Eden,"Herbert, Herbert, Herbert."
ALL,The Way To Eden,"Herbert, Herbert, Herbert."
ALL,The Way To Eden,Free Doctor Sevrin!
ALL,The Way To Eden,Free Doctor Sevrin!
ALL,The Way To Eden,We want to see him right now!
ALL,The Way To Eden,Herbert!
ALL,The Way To Eden,Herbert!
ALL,The Way To Eden,Herbert!
ALL,The Way To Eden,Herbert!
ALL,The Way To Eden,Herbert!
ALL,The Way To Eden,Herbert!
ALL,The Way To Eden,What?
RAD,The Way To Eden,I'm bleeding.
RAD,The Way To Eden,"You've got a hard lip, Herbert."
RAD,The Way To Eden,"Say, tell me, why do you wear all those clothes?"
RAD,The Way To Eden,How do you breathe?
RAD,The Way To Eden,"His name is Sulu, specialist in weapons and navigation."
RAD,The Way To Eden,His hobby is botany.
RAD,The Way To Eden,Can.
RAD,The Way To Eden,I reach botany.
RAD,The Way To Eden,It's my favorite of studies.
RAD,The Way To Eden,What's yours?
RAD,The Way To Eden,When will it?
RAD,The Way To Eden,Can you suggest any special ways to swing them?
RAD,The Way To Eden,There it is.
RAD,The Way To Eden,"They've established Eden, Brother Sevrin."
RAD,The Way To Eden,"At this speed, three hours."
RAD,The Way To Eden,How do you plan to stop them?
RAD,The Way To Eden,By cutting off their life support?
RAD,The Way To Eden,"Approaching right on the dot, just as they plotted it, Brother Sevrin."
RAD,The Way To Eden,"We are in orbit over Eden, Brother Sevrin."
RAD,The Way To Eden,It does destroy.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,(An older male with alien ears.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,Obviously the leader) We are One.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"If you understand One, you know our purpose."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,We turn our backs on confusion and seek the beginning.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,The planet Eden.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"And we protest against being harassed, pursued, attacked, seized and transported here against our wishes."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,We do not recognise Federation regulations nor the existence of hostilities.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,We recognise no authority save that within ourselves.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,We respectfully request that you take us to Eden.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,We respectfully request that you take us to Eden.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,I refuse to accept your findings.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"They're the product of prejudice, not science."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,Untrue!
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,Fantasy.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,Fantasy.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,This is outrageous.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"You're not isolating me, you're imprisoning me."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"You invent a crime, find me guilty and sentence me!"
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,No!
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,It was an infringement on my rights.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,I have no influence over what they do.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,As I have been barred.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,Of course I knew.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,You've researched my life.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,You've read the orders restricting me to travel only in areas of advanced technology because of what my body carries.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,Because this is poison to me.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"This stuff you breathe, this stuff you live in, the shields of artificial atmosphere that we have layered about every planet."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"The programs in those computers that run your ship and your lives for you, they bred what my body carries."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,That's what your science have done to me.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,You've infected me.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,Only the primitives can cleanse me.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,I cannot purge myself until I am among them.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,Only their way of living is right.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,I must go to them.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,I shall go to them and be One with them.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,And together we shall build a world such as this galaxy has never seen.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,A world.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,A life.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,A life.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"So now you're going to try to persuade me that your technologies will find a cure for me, and then I'll be free to go."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,And for that reason I should persuade my friends to behave so that they too will be allowed.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"All right, you send them in."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,I'll talk to them.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"That's right, someone else is running this ship."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,I am.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"All functions, life support as well."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"You cannot interfere, as I have frozen the doors to the control room."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,I do not intend to hand over the helm to you until and unless we reach Eden.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"If I am in any way prevented from reaching that destination, I shall destroy this ship and all aboard."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"Do that, and I shall retaliate."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,I shall not warn you again.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,When will we get there?
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,They'll try to persuade us to change course presently and then they'll attack.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,I have another weapon.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"Take control, Brother Rad."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,Making an adjustment on their circuits.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,At the proper time.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,Let me know when we're in orbit.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"Well, I'm using sound against them, beyond the ultrasonic."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,It will stun them and allow us time to leave.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,We'll go in one of their shuttlecraft.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"I've gone beyond those texts, Irina."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"It's correct for you to be concerned, but be assured also."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,We cannot allow them to come after us.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,It will not reach us in here.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,I can control it all.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,I have adjusted it so that it will suspend its effects after a few moments and allow us time to escape.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"Then, after we've gone, it will automatically reactivate."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"Rejoice, brethren."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,Soon we shall step together into Eden.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,Now we may leave.
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"No, we're not leaving."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,"We're not leaving Eden, none of us."
SEVRIN,The Way To Eden,We're not leaving.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"(A red-headed youth) Are you One, Herbert?"
ADAM,The Way To Eden,He is not Herbert.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,We reach.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Right, brother."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Oh, Herbert, you are stiff!"
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Herbert, Herbert, Herbert."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"(playing a guitar without a sound box) Looking for the good land, Going astray."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Don't cry, don't cry."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Oh, I can't have honey, And I can't have cream."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Gonna live, not die."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Gonna live, not die."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,(Rad plays bongos) Stand in the middle of it all one day.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"I'll look at it shining all around me and say, I'm here, I’m here, In the good land."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,In the new land.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,I'm here.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,She's getting her physical.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Gonna crack my knuckles and jump for joy.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,I got a clean bill of health from Doctor McCoy.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,You know Irina?
ADAM,The Way To Eden,We want to see him now!
ADAM,The Way To Eden,(singing) Stiff man putting my mind in jail.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,And the judge bang the gavel and say no bail.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Gonna lick his hand and wag my tail.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Am I crossing you?
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"I was just thinking, I (sees the lyre) Hey, brother, do you play?"
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Is it Vulcan?
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Can I try it?
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Oh ho, that's now."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,That's real now.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"I reach that, brother."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,I really do.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Give.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Hey, how about a session, you and us?"
ADAM,The Way To Eden,It would sound.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,That's what I came for.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"I wanted to ask, you know, great white captain upstairs, but he don't reach us."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,But would he shake on a session?
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"I mean, we want to co-operate, like you ask, so I'm asking."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,I'll spread the word.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Can?
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Vulcan.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Spock is practically One now.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,It starts to chime.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Soon.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Like he said now, we should all go out and swing as many as possible over."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Just be friendly.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,You know how to be friendly.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Then they'll be friendly.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"(singing) I’m talkin ''bout you, I’m talkin ''bout me."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Long time back when the galaxy was new.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Man found out what he had to do.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Found he had to eat and he found he had to drink.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,And a long time later he found he had to think.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Uh huh.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Yes, think."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,I'm standing here wondering.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,If a man tells another man out of my way.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,He piles up trouble for himself all day.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,But all kinds of trouble come to an end.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"When a man tells another man be my friend, uh huh."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,My friend.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Well, what's it going to be?"
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Can't reach across it, hardly even see."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"(with chorus) Let's say goodbye, or let's say brother."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Brother.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Brother.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Hey, out there."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Hey, out there."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Hey, out there."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Hey, out there."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,I see you.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,I see you.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,I see you.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,I see you.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Let's get together and have some fun.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,I don't know how to do it but it's got to be done.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Like you said, Brother Sevrin."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,He's got jelly in the belly.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Real scared.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,(sarcastic) Ain't that just awful.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Yay, brother."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,You're making me cry.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,What are you doing?
ADAM,The Way To Eden,(singing) Headin' out to Eden.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Yea, brother."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Headin' out to Eden.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,No more trouble in my body or my mind.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Gonna live like a king on whatever I find, Eat all the fruit and throw away the rind."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Yea, brother."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Yea.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,When will you use that?
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Steppin' into Eden.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Yea, brother."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Steppin' into Eden.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Yea, brother."
ADAM,The Way To Eden,No more trouble in my body or my mind.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Gonna live like a king on whatever find.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,Eat all the fruit and throw away the rind.
ADAM,The Way To Eden,"Yea, brother."
CHAPEL,The Way To Eden,(to Sevrin) You're next.
CHAPEL,The Way To Eden,I thought all the animals were kept in cages.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,Trouble.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,Your friend here didn't want a checkup.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,Turns out there's a reason.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,You don't have the choice.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"I don't know what this man was planning on doing on a primitive planet, but assuming one did exist, I can tell you what would have happened had he settled there."
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,There wouldn't have been enough primitives left to bury their dead.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,I wish it were.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"There's a nasty little bug evolved in the last few years, Jim."
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"Our aseptic, sterilised civilisations produced it."
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,Synthococcus novae.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,It's deadly.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"We can immunise against it, but haven't learned to lick all the problems yet."
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,All the others are clear.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,He doesn't have it.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,He's a carrier.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,Remember your ancient history?
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,Typhoid Mary?
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"He's immune, as she was, but he carries the disease and spreads it to others."
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,I don't know.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,They all had full spectrum immunisations before boarding.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,Now my guess is that his friends have had their shots too.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,But a regular programme of shots is necessary.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,I'll have to check everyone on the ship.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,There could be some skips.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"In the meantime, he should be placed in total isolation."
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"Would you like to run the test, Doctor?"
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"You knew you were a carrier before you came aboard, didn't you?"
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,Then why did you fight the examination?
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"Be ready for the objections, Jim."
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,They are a vocal lot.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,It'll show in twenty four hours.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,It's a virulent strain.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,McCoy here.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"Yes, Captain."
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"Yes, Jim."
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,It's burned.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,All this plant life is full of acid.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"Even the grass, Jim."
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,It should for a while.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,Poison.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,The fruit is deadly.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"He should be beamed aboard, Jim."
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,He needs more than I can do for him here.
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,"Come back here, you fool!"
MCCOY,The Way To Eden,Don't bite into that!
WOMAN,The Way To Eden,You don't belong with them!
WOMAN,The Way To Eden,You know what we want.
WOMAN,The Way To Eden,You want it too.
WOMAN,The Way To Eden,"Come, join us."
WOMAN,The Way To Eden,You're young.
WOMAN,The Way To Eden,"Think young, brother!"
GIRL,The Way To Eden,(singing) There's a mile wide emptiness between you and me.
GIRL,The Way To Eden,Someone ought to take a step one way or other.
CREWMAN,The Way To Eden,Hangar Deck to Captain.
CREWMAN,The Way To Eden,"Sir, one of the shuttlecrafts has been taken."
CREWMAN,The Way To Eden,We were all knocked out.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Report.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Let's get that ryetalyn.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Inoperative.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,I'm Captain James Kirk
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Then if you know who we are, you know why we're here, Mister?"
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Mister Flint, I have a sick crew up there."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,We can't possibly reach another planet in time.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,You can't refuse us the ryetalyn.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,We're in need!
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"We'll pay for it, work for it, trade for it."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,But you have the ryetalyn that we need!
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"If necessary, we'll take it."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Mister Scott, lock phasers onto our co-ordinates."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Mister Flint, if anything happens to us, four deaths and then my crew comes down and takes that ryetalyn."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,We need only a few hours.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,With all due gratitude.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"A most impressive home, Mister Flint."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"If that ryetalyn isn't here in one hour, we'll go prospecting, right over Mister Flint if necessary."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Please.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Would be?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,You mean you think they're fakes?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Well, this could be what it seems to be, or it could be a cover, a setup, or even an illusion."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Spock, at your earliest opportunity, take a full tricorder reading of our host."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,See if he's human.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Mister Scott?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Mister Scott, run a full computer check on Mister Flint and on this planet, Holberg Nine One Seven G. Stand by with your results."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,I'll contact.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Kirk out.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Let's enjoy this brandy.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,It tastes real.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Easy.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Bones?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Beam up to the ship and start processing.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Thank you, Mister Flint."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,I don't think we have the time.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,I thought you lived alone.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Rayna.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Why not all three?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Did you teach her that?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"You said something about savagery, Mister Flint."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,When was the last time you visited Earth?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Thank you.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Our missions are peaceful, our weapons defensive."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"If we were barbarians, we would not have asked for ryetalyn."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Indeed, your greeting, not ours, lacked a certain benevolence."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Yes, well, those pressures are everywhere in everyone, urging him to what you call savagery."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"The private hells, the inner needs and mysteries, the beast of instinct."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"As human beings, that is the way it is."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,To be human is to be complex.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,You can't avoid a little ugliness from within and from without.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,May I have the pleasure?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Is something wrong?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Time factor, Bones?"
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Epidemic?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,But would we have made the error?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Go with Flint.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Keep an eye on procedures.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Later, Spock."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,I think I will go to the laboratory.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,There may be a way of reversing the irillium's effect and saving the existing antitoxin.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Stay here.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Let me know when Flint and McCoy return.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,You left us.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,The room became lonely.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,What?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,What's in there?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Then why are you here?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Are you troubled now?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,By what?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Are you happy here with Flint?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Then why are you afraid?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,(he embraces her) Don't be afraid.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"If it were around right now, it would correct"
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"In your own words, it would be an interesting test of power."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,I don't like the way he orders her around.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,He loves her?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Jealousy.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Yes, that would explain the attack, but he seemed to want us together."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,The billiard game.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,He suggested we dance.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Mister Scott.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Report on the Rigelian fever.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Just a little while longer, Scotty."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Report on the computer search.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Run a computer check on Rayna Kapec.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Status, legal ward after the death of her parents."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Kirk out, Mister Scott."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Can you confirm that, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Time factor.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,What's keeping the processing this time?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,As though he's keeping us here for some reason.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Kirk here.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,No award of custody?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Kirk out.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Like Flint.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,People without a past.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,What hold does he have over her?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Let's find McCoy.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,I'll meet you in the lab.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,I don't want to say goodbye.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Come with me.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,I offer you happiness.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Childhood must end.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"You love me, not Flint."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Why is Flint playing tricks on us?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Apparently we're supposed to go in and get it, if we can."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Well, let's not disappoint the chess master."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Phasers on full.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Why you?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Let's find out.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,We'll all go.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Spock, you knew?"
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,: You brought me here to learn this?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Does she know?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Let's go.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Why?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Clear out of the area.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Inform Starfleet Command.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Enterprise?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Scotty?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,My crew.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,You'd wipe out four hundred lives?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Why?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Worse than dead!
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Restore them.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Restore my ship!
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,What needs?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Give me back my ship.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Your secret is safe with us.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,That's why you delayed the processing of the ryetalyn.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,You realised what was happening.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"You kept us together, Rayna and me, because you knew I could bring her emotions alive."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,And now you’re just going to take over.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Impossible?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Impossible.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"From the beginning, you used me."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"I can't love her, but I do love her."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,And she loves me.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Stay out of this.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,We're fighting over a woman.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,She's human.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Down to the last blood cell, she's human."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Down to the last thought, hope, aspiration, emotion, she’s human."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,The human spirit is free.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,You have no power of ownership.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,She's free to do as she wishes.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,I don't want to beat you.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,This is no test of power.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Rayna belongs to herself and she claims the human right of choice to be as she wills, to do as she wills, to think as she wills."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Rayna, come with me."
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,What happened?
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,Spock.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,A very old and lonely man.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,And a young and lonely man.
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,"We put on a pretty poor show, didn't we?"
KIRK,Requiem For Methuselah,If only I could forget.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Jim, there's a large deposit bearing two seven three, four kilometres away."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"I've got four hours to process that stuff, otherwise the epidemic will be irreversible."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Everybody on board the Enterprise will
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Have you ever seen a victim of Rigelian fever?
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,They die in one day.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,The effects are like bubonic plague.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Yes, a Shakespeare first folio."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,A Gutenberg Bible.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,The Creation lithographs by Taranullus of Centauri Seven.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"That's one of the rarest book collections in the galaxy, spanning centuries."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Do we trust him?
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Well, I'll need two hours to process that ryetalyn into antitoxin."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Saurian brandy, one hundred years old."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Jim?
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Mister Spock, I know you won't have one."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Heaven forbid those mathematically perfect brain waves be corrupted by this all too human vice.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Do you think the two of us can handle a drunk Vulcan?
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Once alcohol hits that green blood
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,I'll drink to that.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,What emotion?
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Well, that could explain the paintings."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Similar to the real thing.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Ryetalyn, ready to be processed into antitoxin."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"I would like to supervise that, of course."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"With most impressive results, sir."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"What else interests you besides gravity phenomena, Rayna?"
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,The totality of the universe?
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,All knowledge?
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"At her age, I rather enjoyed errors with no noticeable damage, but I must admit you're the farthest thing from a bookworm I've ever seen."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"The misfortune of men everywhere, and our privilege."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Thank you, sir."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Yes, there's something wrong."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,The ryetalyn is no good.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"It contains irillium, nearly one part per thousand."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Thank you.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Nearly two and a half hours.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,I guess we've got time to get in under the wire.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,I’ve never seen anything like the speed of that robot.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,It'd take us twice as long to process that stuff.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Jim, what if all the ryetalyn on this planet contains irillium?"
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Like a hawk.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"I tell you, Spock, I was waiting for the robot to finish the processing, and the next thing I knew it was gone and so was the ryetalyn."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Well, I think we'd better tell Jim."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Flint lied.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,The ryetalyn isn't here.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Why?
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Get to the point, Spock, if there is one."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,The ryetalyn.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Physically human but not human.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"These are earlier versions of Rayna, Jim."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,She's an android.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Instant tissue regeneration coupled with some perfect form of biological renewal.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,You learned that you were immortal and
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,You have been such men.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,You've known and created such beauty.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"You've watched your race evolve from cruelty and barbarism throughout your enormous life, and yet now you would do this to us?"
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"All emotions are in play, Mister Flint."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"You harm us, she hates you."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,Jim.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Oh, thank heaven, sleeping at last."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Oh, those tricorder readings on Mister Flint are finally correlated: He's dying."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"You see, Flint, in leaving Earth with all of its complex fields within which he was formed, sacrificed immortality."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"He'll live the remainder of a normal life span, then die."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Yes, I told him myself."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,He intends to devote the remainder of his years and great abilities to the improvement of the human condition.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,And who knows what he might come up with.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Well, I guess that's all."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,I can tell Jim later or you can.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Considering his opponent's longevity, truly an eternal triangle."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"You wouldn't understand that, would you, Spock?"
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"You see, I feel sorrier for you than I do for him because you'll never know the things that love can drive a man to."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"The ecstasies, the miseries, the broken rules, the desperate chances, the glorious failures, the glorious victories."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,All of these things you'll never know simply because the word love isn't written into your book.
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,"Goodnight, Spock."
MCCOY,Requiem For Methuselah,I do wish he could forget her.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Strange.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Readings indicate a life form in the vicinity, apparently human."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Yet ship's sensors indicated this planet was uninhabited.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Did you say your planet, sir?"
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Mister Flint, unless you are certain, I would suggest you refrain from a most useless experiment."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Are you a student of history, sir?"
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Then you live here alone.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,It would seem logical to do so for the moment.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"This is the most splendid private collection of art I've ever seen, and the most unique."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"The majority are the works of Leonardo da Vinci, Renaissance period, some of the works of Reginald Pollack, 20th century, and even a sten from Marcus Two."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Thank you, Doctor."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,I will have a brandy.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"If I appear distracted, it is because of what I have seen."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,I am close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Envy.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,None of these da Vinci paintings has ever been catalogued or reproduced.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"They are unknown works, all apparently authentic to the last brush stroke and use of materials."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"As undiscovered da Vinci’s, they would be priceless."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Most strange.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable taste scarcely needs to hang fakes.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Yet my tricorder analysis indicates that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Indeed.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,I would appreciate such a talk.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,It is an interest of mine.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Captain.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Something else which is rather extraordinary.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,This waltz I just played is by Johannes Brahms.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Captain, it is written in manuscript."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"In original manuscript, in Brahms' own hand, which I recognise."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"It is totally unknown, definitely the work of Brahms, and yet unknown."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Fortunately, the robot did not detect my presence and deactivate my phaser."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Fascinating.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Since we are dependent on Mister Flint for the ryetalyn, Captain, may I respectfully suggest that you pay less attention to the young lady if you should encounter her again."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Our host's interests do not appear to be confined to art and science.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Strongly indicated.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,It does appear to defy the male logic as I understand it.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"We have still a greater mystery, Captain."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,I was able to run a tricorder scan on Mister Flint.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"He is human, but there are certain biophysical peculiarities."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Some body function readings are disproportionate.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"For one thing, extreme age is indicated on the order of six thousand years."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,I shall programme the readings through Doctor McCoy's medical computer when we return to the ship.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,We must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and eighteen minutes or the epidemic will prove fatal to us all.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,The delay may be deliberate.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Most interesting.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Our host appears to wish us to linger, yet he is apprehensive."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,It is logical to assume that we are being monitored and that he is aware of our every move.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Captain, I would suggest that our immediate concern is the ryetalyn."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Interesting.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Obviously, Mister Flint is not yet ready for us to depart."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,The captain wanted us to wait here.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Picking up tricorder readings, Captain."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Apparently the ryetalyn is behind this door.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Captain, I shall get the ryetalyn."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,There may be dangers within.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Let me go alone, Captain."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces, Mister Flint, they appear to have been recently painted on contemporary canvas with contemporary materials."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"And on your piano, a waltz by Johannes Brahms, an unknown work in manuscript, written in modern ink."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Yet absolutely authentic, as are your paintings."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,And da Vinci?
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,How many other names shall we call you?
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,You were born?
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of acquisition.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,You knew the greatest minds in history.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"You wanted a perfect, ultimate woman, as brilliant, as immortal as yourself."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Your mate for all time.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,I had hoped I was wrong.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"We have discovered what he is, Captain."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,We can remain silent.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,What will you feel for him after we are gone?
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Captain, your primitive impulses will not alter the circumstances."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"No, you're not, for she is not."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Gentlemen, I urge you to stop."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,There is a danger.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"She loved you, Captain."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"And you, too, Mister Flint, as a mentor, even as a father."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,There was not enough time for her to adjust to the awful power and contradictions of her new-found emotions.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,She could not bear to hurt either of you.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"The joys of love made her human, and the agonies of love destroyed her."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,The epidemic is reduced and no longer a threat.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"The Enterprise is on course five one three mark seven, as you ordered."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Your report, Doctor."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"On that day, I shall mourn."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Does he know?
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Indeed.
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,"Goodnight, Doctor."
SPOCK,Requiem For Methuselah,Forget.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Do not kill.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I know who you are.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I have monitored your ship since it entered this system.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Flint.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,You will leave my planet.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"My retreat from the unpleasantness of life on Earth, and the company of people."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"You're trespassing, Captain."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,You have nothing I want.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"If you do not leave voluntarily, I have the power to force you to leave or kill you where you stand."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,An interesting test of power.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Your enormous forces against mine.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Who would win?
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Constantinople, summer 1334."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"It marched through the streets, the sewers."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"It left the city by ox cart, by sea, to kill half of Europe."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"The rats, rustling and squealing in the night as they, too, died."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,The rats.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I am.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"The Enterprise, a plague ship."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"You have two hours, at the end of which time you will leave."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,M4 will gather the ryetalyn which you need.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,(the device leaves) Permit me to offer you more comfortable surroundings.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Come in, gentlemen."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,My planet is surrounded by screens which create the impression of lifelessness.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"A protection against the curious, the uninvited."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Except for M4, which serves as butler, housekeeper, gardener and guardian."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Be comfortable, gentlemen."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Help yourselves to brandy.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Other men.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,The Vulcan.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Even he is not your intellectual equal, nor mine."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"They are selfish, brutal, a part of the human community which I rejected and from which I've shielded you."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Rayna.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,(nearly kisses her) Have you been lonely?
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,It is thirst.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,It is a flower dying in the desert.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Exciting?
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,You have never made a demand of me before.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Do not be sorry.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,It might be interesting.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"That will not be necessary, Captain."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,M4 can prepare the ryetalyn for inoculation more quickly in my laboratory than you could aboard your ship.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"And when you are satisfied as to procedures, I hope you will do me the honour of being my guests at dinner."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I regret my earlier inhospitality.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Let me make amends.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Gentlemen, may I present Rayna."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I meant there are no others besides my family.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Doctor McCoy.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Mister Spock.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Captain Kirk.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Her parents were killed in an accident while in my employ.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Before dying, they placed their infant, Rayna Kapec, in my custody."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I have raised and educated her.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Rayna possesses the equivalent of seventeen university degrees in the sciences and arts.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,She is aware that the intellect is not all.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"But its cultivation must come first or the individual makes errors, wastes time in unprofitable pursuits."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"If you would accompany my robot to the laboratory, Doctor, you can rest assured that the ryetalyn is being processed."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Your pleasure, gentlemen."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Chess, billiards, conversation?"
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,We play often.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,You would tell me that it is no longer cruel.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"But it is, Captain."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Look at your starship, bristling with weapons."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Its mission to colonise, exploit, destroy, if necessary, to advance Federation causes."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,The result of pressures which are not your concern.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Why don't you play the waltz, Mister Spock?"
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"To be human is also to seek pleasure, to laugh, to dance."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Rayna is a most accomplished dancer.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Most unfortunate that it was not detected.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I shall go with M4 to gather more ryetalyn and screen it myself.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"You're welcome to join me, Doctor."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,M4 was programmed to defend this household and its members.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,No doubt I should have altered its instructions to allow for unauthorised but predictable actions on your part.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,It thought you were attacking Rayna.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,A misinterpretation.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Too useful a device to be without, really."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I created another.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,It will now go to the laboratory and join Doctor McCoy.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Be thankful that you did not attack me, Captain."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"I might have accepted battle, and I have twice your physical strength."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"How childish he is, Rayna."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Would you call him brave or a fool?
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Of course!
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Death, when unnecessary, is a tragic thing."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Doctor McCoy's in the laboratory with the new ryetalyn.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,He's satisfied as to its quality.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"May I suggest that you wait here patiently, safely."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,You have seen that my defence systems operate automatically and not always in accordance with my wishes.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Come, Rayna."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Rayna!
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Come.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,It came to protect you.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"It was defective, then."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I would have destroyed it myself.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Have I lied to you?
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Believe what I say.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I would not want Captain Kirk dead.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,What did you feel?
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Yes.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Go to them, if you wish."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Say your farewells.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"A last tender encounter, Captain Kirk, to end your usefulness."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Created here by my hand.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Here, the centuries of loneliness were to end."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I am Brahms.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Yes.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Solomon, Alexander, Lazarus, Methuselah, Merlin, Abramson."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,A hundred other names you do not know.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"In that region of earth later called Mesopotamia, in the year 3834 BC, as the millennia are reckoned."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"I was Akharin, a soldier, a bully and a fool."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"I fell in battle, pierced to the heart and did not die."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,And to conceal it.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"To live some portion of a life, to pretend to age and then move on before my nature was suspected."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Galileo, Socrates, Moses."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"I have married a hundred times, Captain."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Selected, loved, cherished."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Caressed a smoothness, inhaled a brief fragrance."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Then age, death, the taste of dust."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Do you understand?
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Designed by my heart.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I could not love her more.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"You cannot love an android, Captain."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I love her.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"She is my handiwork, my property."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,She is what I desire.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,She will never know.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,You will stay.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"If you leave, the curious would follow, the foolish, the meddlers, the officials, the seekers."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,My privacy was my own.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Its invasion be on your head.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"The disaster of intervention, Spock."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I've known it.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I will not risk it.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"They cannot answer, Captain."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,The test of power.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,You had no chance.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,It is time for you to join your crew.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I have seen a hundred billion fall.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I know death better than any man.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I have tossed enemies into his grasp.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,And I know mercy.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Your crew is not dead, but suspended."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,In time.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"A thousand, two thousand years."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"You will know the future, Captain Kirk."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,The flowers of my past.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I hold the nettles of the present.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"I am Flint now, with my needs."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Tonight I have seen something wondrous, something I've waited for, laboured for."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Nothing must endanger it.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"At last, Rayna's emotions have stirred to life."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Now they will turn to me in this solitude which I preserve.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Rayna.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I must.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,I shall take what is mine when she comes to me.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"We are mated, Captain, alike, immortal."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,"You must forget your feelings in this matter, which is quite impossible for you."
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,No!
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Rayna!
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,No man beats me.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,That's what I've worked for.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,Stay.
FLINT,Requiem For Methuselah,You can't die.
SCOTT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Aye, Captain, all phasers locked on."
SCOTT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Nearly everybody aboard has got it, Captain."
SCOTT,Requiem For Methuselah,We're working a skeleton crew and waiting for the ryetalyn.
SCOTT,Requiem For Methuselah,"Mister Scott, sir."
SCOTT,Requiem For Methuselah,There’s no record of a Rayna Kapec in Federation legal banks.
SCOTT,Requiem For Methuselah,No background at all in any computer banks.
SCOTT,Requiem For Methuselah,Like Flint.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,At last I have seen other humans.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,One is not human.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,"Oh, so that is a Vulcan."
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I would like to discuss sub-dimensional physics with him.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,You've taught me all you know in the area and you say Vulcans know more.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Let me meet them.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Soon they will be gone.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Let me meet them.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,What is loneliness?
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,"Flint, don't take this opportunity away from me."
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,It's so exciting.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I'm sorry.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,"Mister Spock, I do hope we can find a moment to discuss field density and its relationship to gravity phenomena."
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Captain Kirk.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Everything.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Less than that is betrayal of the intellect.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Flint is my teacher.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,You are the only other men I've ever seen.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,"May I show you, Captain?"
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,"It is a thirst, a flower dying in the desert."
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I do not know.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Flint told me never to enter.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,He denies me nothing else.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I do not know.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,"I come here when I am troubled, when I would search myself."
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Yes.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,"He is the greatest, kindest, wisest man in the galaxy."
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Stop command.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Stop.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I'm glad he did not die.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,You sent the robot to kill him.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,My mind could not have summoned it.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I was not frightened.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Never.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,You will let them have the ryetalyn?
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Captain?
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I've come to say goodbye.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I've known security here.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,No.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,You must not do this to them.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I cannot be the cause of this.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I will not be the cause of this.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Please stop.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Stop!
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I choose where I want to go.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,what I want to do.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I choose.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I choose.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,No.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Do not order me.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,No one can order me!
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I was not human.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,Now I love.
RAYNA,Requiem For Methuselah,I love.
UHURA,Requiem For Methuselah,There is no report on Mister Flint.
UHURA,Requiem For Methuselah,He doesn't seem to have any past.
UHURA,Requiem For Methuselah,"The planet was purchased thirty years ago by a Mister Brack, a wealthy financier and recluse."
UHURA,Requiem For Methuselah,"Aye, sir."
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain","All observation stations, take final
readings."
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain",This'll be our last orbit.
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain","I'm reading it now, Mister Spock."
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain","It seems to indicate artificial
power being generated in factor seven quantities."
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain","Completing final orbit, sir."
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain","Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain",Perfect oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain","(in the captain's chair) All ship's systems
going dead."
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain",Switch to reserve power.
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain",All decks report status.
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain",Bridge to Engineering.
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain",Come in.
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain",What's happening to our power?
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain","Bridge to Engineering, report."
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain",No answer yet on what caused it.
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain",They're standing by.
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain",Captain!
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain",How can we warn him?
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain","Is that you, Captain?"
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain",Are you all right?
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain","We should be on warp power within thirty minutes, sir."
SULU,"The
Savage Curtain","Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Spock, any answers?"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Which is scientifically impossible under conditions there.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Lieutenant, anything from the planet?"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Transmit to Starfleet our sensor readings and log entries on the
planet."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Surface conditions make it impossible for us to beam down and
investigate further."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",We are therefore going on to our next assignment.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Prepare to warp us out.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Alert status.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Uhura
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",I recognise what you appear to be.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Spock.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","I was requesting your analysis, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","We'd be honoured to have you aboard, Mister President."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","We can convert to it, sir."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","(signing a PADD) Thank you, Mister Mulney."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Magnification four, helm."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Security, send a detachment to the transporter room immediately,
phaser side arms, and be prepared to give presidential honours."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",It's obvious he believes it.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock, full
dress uniforms."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","If so, we'll execute appropriate honours to each, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Gentlemen, I don't for a moment believe that President Lincoln is
actually coming aboard, but we're dealing with an unknown and
apparently highly advanced life-form."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Until we know, when in Rome,
we'll do as the Romans do."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Doctor McCoy, take tricorder readings and see if it is human."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Appropriate ruffles and flourishes, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Security, stand
ready."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Energise.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","The USS Enterprise is honoured to have you aboard, Mister
President."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","That's taped music, sir."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","A starship on active duty never carries
an honour detachment."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","An energy-matter scrambler, sir."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","The molecules in your body are
converted into energy, then beamed into this chamber and reconverted
back into their original pattern."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister President, may I present my officers."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Commander Spock,
second in command, Engineering Officer Scott and Security Officer
Dickerson."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Lieutenant Dickerson, you and your men may return to quarters."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Mister President.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Yes, if I recall, your Union Army observation
balloons were tendered six hundred or so feet high."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","We're six hundred
and forty three miles above the surface of this planet."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Yes, Lieutenant."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","May I present our communications officer, Lieutenant Uhura."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",We've each learned to be delighted with what we are.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","The Vulcans
learned that centuries before we did."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Certainly.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Our engineering officer
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Oh, dear."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","If you’ll forgive me, our communications officer"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Forgive me again.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",We'll rejoin you shortly.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Sorry to have been delayed, gentlemen."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","I doubt that, Bones, but continue."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Yes, of course he's an alien."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Gentlemen, as you know, Mister Spock and I have been invited to
beam down to the planet surface with him."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Any comments on that?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",But why would he want to kill only two of us?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Why Lincoln, Spock?"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Any speculation on that?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","But not only to me, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","The very reason for the existence of our starships is contact
with other life."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Although the method is beyond our comprehension, we
have been offered contact."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Therefore, I shall beam down."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister Spock,
as for you"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",And you're on the edge of insubordination.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Gentlemen, your concern is noted and appreciated."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister Spock,
standard dress, tricorders and phasers."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","We will guide President Lincoln
to the transporter room."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",We'll beam down immediately.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Standing by, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","All right, Mister Scott, energise."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Enterprise?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Kirk to
Enterprise."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Your explanation, sir?"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Why were our weapons taken?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Why can't we communicate with our
ship?"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",The game is over.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",We've treated you with courtesy.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","We've gone
along with what and who you think you are."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Who?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Spock, we'll not go along with these charades any longer."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",We know nothing of your world or your customs.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","What do you mean,
drama about to unfold?"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","We perceive we were invited to come here, and we came in
friendship."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","And you have deprived us of our instruments to examine your
world, to defend ourselves, to communicate with our vessel."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","What do you mean, survival?"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Mister Spock and I refuse to participate.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Analysis, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Why do they want us to fight?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",And they'll get their answers if it kills us.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",What do you want?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","You're somewhat different than the way history paints you,
Colonel Green."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Where do you come from?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",What do you propose?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","You were notorious, Colonel Green, for striking
at your enemies in the midst of negotiating with them."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Anyone hurt?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Mister Spock?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","No, I think Colonel Green is right."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","That rock-like thing is our
enemy, not those illusions."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Scotty, do you read me?"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",What caused the red alert?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Scotty, beam us up fast."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",What happened?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",What caused that?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",What if they defeat us?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Scotty, inform Starfleet Command."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Disengage
nacelles, Jettison if possible."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister Spock, assist them."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Advise and
analyse."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Scotty?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Scotty?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","There's nothing immoral about fighting an
illusion, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","We play their game, fight, or lose the ship and
all the crewmen aboard."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",We'll use this as a base.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",It's defensible.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","They can't approach
without being seen."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","No, we don't have time."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","But if things go against us, I want a
place to retreat to."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","What I want to do now is scout them out, find
their weaknesses and attack."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Occasionally.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Why?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Thank you.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Thank you.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister Spock, we'll need weapons."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","I believe
the ancient Vulcans made something like a boomerang?"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",And slings and spears.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Slings.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Mister President.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","You used a sling
as a boy."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","We don't have much time, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Circumstances were different then, Surak."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",I'm afraid that kind of logic doesn't apply here.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",My ship is at stake.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","So are mine, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","If I believed that there was a peaceful way
out of this"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",You saw how treacherously they acted.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",I have no authority over you.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",You may do as you think best.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","The weapons, gentlemen."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",In case he fails.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Your Surak is a brave man.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","You show emotion, Spock."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","I hope he accomplishes something here, and soon."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Surak?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Yes, I know that."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",I should never have let him go.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",How can you ignore that?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Whether he's a Vulcan or not, he's in agony."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",But you can just listen to it and do nothing.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",I can't.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",I can’t just let him stay there.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Do what they want, sir?"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",And what will you do?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",No.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","I can't let you risk it, Mister President."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Your campaign, Mister President."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Mister Lincoln!
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",You established the methods and the goals.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",What did you offer the others if they won?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",You offered me the lives of my crew.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",How many others have you done this to?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","What gives you the right
to hand out life and death?"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",We came in peace.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Come in.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Yes, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",We're all right.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",You may beam us aboard.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister Scott, report."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Mister Sulu.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Good.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Mister Chekov.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Thank you, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister Spock, any explanation?"
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",Well?
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",They seemed so real.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","And to me, especially Mister Lincoln."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","I feel
I actually met Lincoln."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain",It was so hard for me to see him die again.
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","I feel I understand
what Earth must have gone through to achieve final peace."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","There's still so much of their work to be done in the galaxy,
Spock."
KIRK,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister Sulu, break us out of orbit and continue to our next
assignment."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","I still read a suggestion of carbon cycle life forms on the
planet surface, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Agreed.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister Sulu, switch to the planet area I have under
observation."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Which would indicate a considerable civilisation there.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Our readings could be false, Captain, perhaps caused by some
natural phenomena."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","We're being scanned, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","A deep probe, incredibly swift."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","They did scan us and our vessel, Captain, and doubtless obtained
sufficient information to present this illusion."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Small change occurring there, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",An area of approximately one thousand square kilometres.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","It
measures completely Earth-like."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Fascinating.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","For a moment, it appeared almost mineral."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Like
living rock with heavy fore claws."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","It’s settling down now to completely
human readings."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Band honours ready, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","We do, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Six hundred forty three miles, two thousand twenty
one feet, two point zero four inches at this moment, using your
old-style measurements."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","It is basic to the Vulcan philosophy, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","The combination of a
number of things to make existence worthwhile."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","More that direction, Engineer."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","I am, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",I am observing the alien.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",It would be illogical.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","With such abilities, they could as easily
trick us into destroying the entire vessel."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","No, I'm not, Doctor."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","There's no doubt they want us down there
for some hidden purpose."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Otherwise, they would have revealed some
logical reason for all of this."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Speculation is unnecessary, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",The answer is clear.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",President Lincoln has always been a very personal hero to you.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","What
better way to titillate your curiosity than to make him come alive for
you."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Agreed.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","I, too, experienced his charm."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","It is a magnificent work
of duplication."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Captain, since I was included in the invitation to make contact,
I must beam down with you."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Captain.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Our phasers and tricorders did not beam down with us.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Undamaged, yet something is preventing them from functioning."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Surak.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","The greatest of all who ever lived on our planet, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","The
father of all we became."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",It is not logical that you are Surak.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","There is no fact,
extrapolation of fact or theory, which would make possible."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Live long and prosper, image of Surak, father of all we now hold
true."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","As I turned and my eyes beheld you, I displayed emotion."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","I beg
forgiveness."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","It may be exactly as explained, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Our concept of good and
evil is strange to them."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Perhaps they wish to determine which is
strongest."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","I'm all right, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","However, I suggest that we prepare
ourselves for another attack."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","And if they’re real, Captain?"
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Captain.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Logic dictates that we consider another course.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","His convictions are most profound in this matter, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","The captain knows that I have fought at his side before and will
do so now, if need be."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","However, I too, am a Vulcan, bred to peace."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Let
him attempt it."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",I deeply respect what he has accomplished.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","They're trying to goad us into attacking, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","They expect
us to act rashly."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",He was aware of what might happen when he went.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","You had no choice, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",You could not have stopped him.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain",A Vulcan would not cry out so.
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","I am not insensitive to it, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Captain, that is what they are waiting for."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","They're waiting for
us to attempt a rescue."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","No, sir."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Conjecture, Captain, rather than explanation."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able
to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was
desired."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","So they were able to create images of Surak and Lincoln after
scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Yes, and Surak."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Perhaps in a sense they were real, Captain."
SPOCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Since they were created out of our own thoughts, how could they be
anything but what we expected them to be?"
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","What's all this poppycock about life forms on this planet,
Spock?"
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",The surface is molten lava.
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",The atmosphere is poisonous.
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","Well I think Starfleet should forget about those old space
legends."
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",There's no intelligent life here.
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",Jim!
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","Jim, do you really believe he's Abraham Lincoln?"
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","Human, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",Just what was it you locked onto before you beamed him aboard?
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",And that became Lincoln?
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",I'm not quite sure.
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",Where the devil are they?
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","Jim, I would be the last to advise you on your command image."
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",Do I have to lay it out for you?
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","Practically the entire crew has
seen you treat this impostor like the real thing when he can’t possibly
be the real article."
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",You're the science officer.
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","Why aren't you, well, doing whatever
a science officer does at a time like this?"
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",At last!
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",At least somebody agrees with us he's an alien.
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","Yes, a big one."
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","Suddenly, miraculously, we see a small spot of
Earth-type environment down there."
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","Now is it really there, or do we
just think we see it down there?"
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","Are you implying, Mister Spock, that it's probably safe to beam
down there?"
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","But he holds a special involvement to you, Jim."
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","I think it's
interesting, in as much as you're the one who's going to make the
decision whether to beam down or not."
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",You're both out of your heads!
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","Would I be on the edge of insubordination to remind the captain
that this smells of something happening to him that I might not be able
to patch together again?"
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",If they’re wrong and they do beam into a pool of lava
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",Scotty.
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","If they’re all right, they should've reported in."
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",At least the captain and Spock are safe.
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",Can we beam the captain and Spock back up?
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","Well, can we send the phasers down?"
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","But they're not real, any more than that Lincoln or Surak."
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain","What
do the sensors read?"
MCCOY,"The
Savage Curtain",Could they be aliens projecting an illusion?
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain","I've repeatedly tried on every hailing frequency, sir."
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain","There's
no response on any channel."
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain","Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain","Excuse me, Captain Kirk."
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain",Mister Scott
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain","But why should I object to that term, sir?"
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain","You see, in our
century we've learned not to fear words."
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain","Has been waiting in the briefing room for you, sir, for over two
hours."
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain",All decks report status.
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain",All decks report status.
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain","No damage report, Mister Scott."
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister Scott, I have the captain."
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister Scott, I have the captain."
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain","Red Alert, Captain."
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain",Mister Scott is standing by.
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain","I don't know yet, sir."
UHURA,"The
Savage Curtain","Captain Kirk, the planet has resumed its normal appearance."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Captain Kirk, I believe."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","A pleasure to make
your acquaintance, sir."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",No need to check your voice telegraph device.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",Do I gather that you recognise me?
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","And appearances can be most deceiving, but not
in this case, James Kirk."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",I am Abraham Lincoln.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","I have been described in many ways, Mister
Spock, but never with that word."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",Illusion?
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Captain, will you permit me to come
aboard your vessel?"
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","No doubt you have devices which can check my
reality."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",Do you still measure time in minutes?
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Then you should be directly over my position
in."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",There.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",Exactly twelve and one half minutes.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Until then, Captain."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",Strange.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",Where are the musicians?
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Taped music, you say."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Well, perhaps Mister Spock will be good
enough to explain that to me later."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","A most interesting way to come
aboard, Captain."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",What was the device used?
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Well, since I'm obviously here, and quite whole, whatever you
mean apparently works very well indeed."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Gentlemen, if those are
weapons, please lower them."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","At my age, I'm afraid I'm not very
dangerous."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","All too human, Doctor McCoy."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",Happy to make your acquaintance.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister Spock, Mister Scott, Mister Dickerson."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Gentlemen, I
hope to talk to each of you."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","But meanwhile, your captain is consumed
with questions and I shall do my utmost to answer them."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",And I trust your duties will permit time to answer some of mine.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","At
your service, Captain."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",A most interesting vessel.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",You can measure great distances that closely?
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",Bless me.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",What a charming negress.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Oh, forgive me, my dear."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","I know in my
time some used that term as a description of property."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","The foolishness of my century had me apologising where no
offense was given."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",Yes.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Philosophy of Nome, meaning all."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",How did I know that?
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Just as I seem to know that on the planet surface you will meet one of
the greatest living Vulcans in all the long history of your planet."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","My
mind cannot recall his name, but I know he will be there."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","What is it
that powers your vessel, Captain?"
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",May I see your engine room?
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",I would be delighted to have her as guide.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Well, I have none."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",To me this seems quite as it should be.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Please, believe me."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","I know nothing other than what I have
already told you."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Despite the seeming contradictions, all is as it appears to
be."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",I am Abraham Lincoln.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","I'm afraid none of us may leave, gentlemen, until we do what
it demands of us."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","I fear my clothing is somewhat damaged, but how delightful to
discover at my age that I can still wrestle."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","For an illusion, my opponent carried a considerable punch."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Oh,
I forgot."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",You consider me an illusion too.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","James, the war is forced upon us."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",History repeats itself.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Are we fighting a defensive war, James?"
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",Do you drink whiskey?
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Because you have qualities very much like those of another man
I admire greatly."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",General Grant.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",Indeed I did.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Perhaps we can rescue him, Mister Spock."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Now, I suggest that
we do whatever they want."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Not the way they want it, however."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","We must first convince them
that they have provoked us to recklessness."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","James, I do not mean to
presume upon your authority."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","What I propose is that I circle around to
their rear while you two provide a frontal assault."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","It should be
sufficiently violent to cover whatever I do."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Why, slip into their camp and free him."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","James, James."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Remember, I was something of a backwoodsman."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","I
doubt that you could do what I was bred to."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",I am no longer president.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister Spock, any comment?"
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","One matter further, gentlemen."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",We fight on their level.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","With
trickery, brutality, finality."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",We match their evil.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","I know, James."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",I was reputed to be a gentle man.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","But I was commander in
chief during the four bloodiest years of my country's history."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","I gave
orders that sent a hundred thousand men to their death at the hands of
their brothers."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","There is no honourable way to kill, no gentle way to
destroy."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",There is nothing good in war except its ending.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","And you are
fighting for the lives of your crew."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",Surak.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","Surak, the others have drawn them away."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",We will circle around.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","It was a worthy effort, Surak."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain",Worthy.
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","No need to blame yourself before
its failure."
LINCOLN,"The
Savage Curtain","James, stay back."
CHEKOV,"The
Savage Curtain","He called it to the second, sir."
CHEKOV,"The
Savage Curtain","We'll be over it in exactly
twelve minutes now."
CHEKOV,"The
Savage Curtain",Bridge to Transporter room.
CHEKOV,"The
Savage Curtain","One minute to overhead
position."
CHEKOV,"The
Savage Curtain","We are now locked in synchronous orbit, Mister Scott."
CHEKOV,"The
Savage Curtain","Sensors continue to show the area as completely Earth-like in all
respects."
CHEKOV,"The
Savage Curtain",As life-forms.
CHEKOV,"The
Savage Curtain",They are living beings.
CHEKOV,"The
Savage Curtain",The readings are those of humanoids.
CHEKOV,"The
Savage Curtain","The deterioration in the shielding has stopped and is reversing
itself."
CHEKOV,"The
Savage Curtain",I have no explanation.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Full dress?
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Presidential honours?
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","What is this nonsense, Mister
Dickerson?"
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Ha!
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","You're daft, man."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","I'd have expected sanity from the ship's surgeon, at least."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","President Lincoln, indeed."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","No doubt to be followed by Louis of France
and Robert the Bruce."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Locked on to something.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Does that appear human to you, Mister
Spock?"
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","We can beam it aboard anytime now, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",You heard Mister Spock yourself.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Mineral he called it, like
living rock."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",I couldn't tell.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","It may have been another figure down there
standing by."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",What do you make of it?
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Why, they're probably looking up a plate of haggis in the
galley."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",They've been everywhere else.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Lincoln died three centuries ago on a planet hundreds of light
years away."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Mad.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Loony as an Arcturian dogbird.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",You might beam down into a sea of molten lava.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Don't do it, Captain."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Aye!
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Transporter room to bridge.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Standing by.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Then they're dead men.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",I couldna pull them back in time.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Come in, landing party."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Report.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Enterprise
to Captain Kirk."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Can you read us?
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","How is it, Mister Sulu?"
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Shut down all but the most necessary systems.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Engage restart cycle.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Start emergency procedures.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",It's a confrontation of some sort.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Those are all figures out of
history."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Notoriously evil.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",We don't have the power.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","They'll come aboard a mass of dying
flesh."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","There's nothing we can do, Doctor."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Nothing but watch them.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","He's
skimmed the worst ones in history to face them."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Scott to Engineering.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Report,
Lieutenant."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Give me that again, man."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",I cannot hear you.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Engineering, check for radiation."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","Get a repair crew on it at
once."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Is there a danger of detonation?
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Captain.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",I cannot.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",We have a complete power failure.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",We're on emergency battery power only.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","I can't explain it, sir, but the matter and
antimatter are in red zone proximity."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",There's no knowing and there's no stopping it either.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","The
shielding is breaking down."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","I estimate four hours before it goes
completely."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",Four hours before the ship blows up.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain","The ship is functioning normally again, sir, and the restart
cycle is in operation."
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",You'd never know anything had been out of order.
SCOTT,"The
Savage Curtain",I can't fathom it.
DICKERSON,"The
Savage Curtain","I understand President Lincoln's coming aboard, sir."
DICKERSON,"The
Savage Curtain","All I know is what the captain tells me, and he says he'll
have the hide of the first man that so much as smiles."
DICKERSON,"The
Savage Curtain","Phaser team, set ready for a heavy stun."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",Just as I am whom I appear to be.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Live long and prosper, Spock."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","May you also,
Captain Kirk."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Whatever I am, would it harm you to give response?"
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","The image of Surak read in your face what is in your mind,
Spock."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",The cause was more than sufficient.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Let us speak no further of
it."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","In my time, we knew not of Earth men."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","I am pleased to see that we
have differences."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","May we together become greater than the sum of both
of us."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",The captain speaks wisely.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",Those four are not our enemy.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","We
should arrive together at a peaceful settlement."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","In my time on Vulcan, we also faced these same alternatives."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",We'd suffered devastating wars which nearly destroyed our planet.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",Another was about to begin.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",We were torn.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","But out of our suffering some
of us found the discipline to act."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","We sent emissaries to our opponents
to propose peace."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","The first were killed, but others followed."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Ultimately we achieved peace, which has lasted since then."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","The face of war has never changed, Captain."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Surely it is more
logical to heal than kill."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",That is precisely why we should not fight.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","I will not harm others, Captain."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",The risk will be mine alone.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","If I fail, you lose nothing."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","After
all, I'm no warrior."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Oh, yes."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","But perhaps it's our belief in peace that is actually
being tested."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",Thank you.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",May you live long and prosper.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",I come in peace to propose peace.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","No, I speak for myself because I abhor violence."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","But if you
accept the solution I offer, they, too, will accept it."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","No, Colonel."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","They are at their base awaiting an
answer."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",He talks peace if it is the only way to live.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",Nothing but the knowledge that I have done what I believe in.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",Your life and the lives of the others.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","You said yourself,
Colonel, that we have common cause to survive."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",Together we can.
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","But not
by warring."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Colonel, surely you accept the logic of this."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","What is your
answer?"
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Men of peace usually are, Captain."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","On Vulcan, he is revered as
the father of our civilisation."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","The father image holds much meaning for
us."
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Help me, Spock!"
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Spock, help me!"
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",Spock!
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Help me, Spock!"
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",Spock!
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain",Help me!
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Help me, Spock!"
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Help me, Spock!"
SURAK,"The
Savage Curtain","Help me, Spock!"
ENGINEER,"The
Savage Curtain",Everything's out.
ENGINEER,"The
Savage Curtain",We've switched to reserve power.
ENGINEER,"The
Savage Curtain","Lost
all power in the warp engines."
ENGINEER,"The
Savage Curtain","No indication of engine damage, sir."
ENGINEER,"The
Savage Curtain",I can't.
ENGINEER,"The
Savage Curtain",I don't understand it.
ENGINEER,"The
Savage Curtain","Aye, aye, sir."
ENGINEER,"The
Savage Curtain","Emergency increasing, sir."
ENGINEER,"The
Savage Curtain","Deterioration has just started, sir."
ENGINEER,"The
Savage Curtain","We have already, sir."
ENGINEER,"The
Savage Curtain",We can't seem to stop it.
ENGINEER,"The
Savage Curtain","Estimating four hours, sir."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","You'll have an answer soon, Captain."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Our world is called
Excalbia."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Countless who live on that planet are watching.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Before this drama unfolds, we give welcome to the ones named Kirk and
Spock."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","You're intelligent life form, but I'm surprised you do not
perceive the honour we do you."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Have we not created in this place on our
planet a stage identical to your own world?"
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Your objection is well taken.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","We shall communicate with your
vessel so your fellow life forms may also enjoy and profit from the
play."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Behold.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Captain, Mister Spock, some of these you may know through
history."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Genghis Khan, for one."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","And Colonel Green, who led a genocidal
war early in the 21st century on Earth."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Zora, who experimented with the
body chemistry of subject tribes on Tiburon."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Kahless the Unforgettable, the Klingon who set the pattern for his
planet's tyrannies."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",We welcome the vessel Enterprise
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","To our solar system and to
our spectacle."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",We ask you to observe with us
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","The confrontation of the two opposing
philosophies you term good and evil."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Since this is our first experiment
with Earthlings, our theme is a simple one."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Survival, life and death."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Your philosophies are alien to us, and we wish to understand them and
discover which is the stronger."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",We learn by observing such spectacles.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",The word is explicit.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","If you and Spock survive, you return to
your vessel."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","If you do not, your existence is ended."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Why do you hesitate?
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Do you wish further clarification?
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Your
choice of action is unlimited, as is your choice of weapons."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Should you
wish to use any, you may fabricate anything you desire out of what you
can find around you."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Captain?
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",You will decide otherwise.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",I am disappointed.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","You display no interest in the honour we do
you."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","We offer you an opportunity to become our teachers by
demonstrating whether good or evil is more powerful."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","You find my body
heat distressing, Captain?"
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",You forget the nature of this planet.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","I must
conclude that your species requires a cause to fight for."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","You may now
communicate with your ship."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",The estimate is quite correct.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Your ship will
blow itself to bits within four hours, Captain, unless you defeat the
others before then."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Is that cause enough to fight for?
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","To save your ship and your
crew, you have to win."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Your communicators no longer function, Captain."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","You may proceed
with the spectacle."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",You are the survivors.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",The others have run off.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","It would seem
that evil retreats when forcibly confronted."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","However, you have failed
to demonstrate to me any other difference between your philosophies."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","Your good and your evil use the same methods, achieve the same results."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Do you have an explanation?
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",For you to use as you chose.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",What they wanted most.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",Power.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",I perceive you have won their lives.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",The same right that brought you here.
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain","The need to know new
things."
ROCK,"The
Savage Curtain",And you may go in peace.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","Captain Kirk, may I speak with you?"
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","I quite agree with your
attitude toward this charade."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","It's ridiculous to think that we should
take part in it."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","The same thing as you do, to get out of here."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","I have no quarrel
with you any more than you have with me."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",History tends to exaggerate.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","I suggest we call a halt to this at
once and see if we can't find some way out of our difficulties."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","My
associates are in full agreement with me."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","Captain, you were tricked
into coming here, weren't you?"
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",So were we all.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",I can't remember.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",Isn't that strange?
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","My memory used to be quite
remarkable."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","Well, wherever it was, I want to get back."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","So it seems to
me, Captain, that we have a common cause, and our enemy is that
creature."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","That we combine forces, and
reason some way to overcome it."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","But that was centuries ago, Captain, and not
altogether true."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","No, there is much I would change now if I could."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","Don't
let prejudice and rumour sway you."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",Did you set the traps?
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",What did you find out?
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",What are they doing?
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",With what?
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",These?
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",(pointed sticks)
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","No, it's not advantage enough."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","I want to make sure the odds are
in our favour."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","Overwhelm and devastate, that's the way to get power and
to hold it, and I mean to do that."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",No.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",Let's hear what he has to say.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",We may find it useful.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","Stop
there, Vulcan."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",State your purpose.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",Are you surrendering?
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",Why are you doing this?
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",Do you speak for the others?
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",How can I be sure?
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","I think
you’re trying to trick me, Vulcan."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","I think that while you're here
talking peace, the others are preparing to attack."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",How can I believe that?
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","No one talks peace
unless he's ready to back it up with war."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","Then tell me, what do you have to gain if we accept?"
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",What do I get out of it?
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","I fight for gain, Vulcan."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","What do I
gain here?"
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",No.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",He's our means to finish them all.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","You're very persuasive, Vulcan."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","I'd like to come out of this
with a whole skin."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","Perhaps I can convince my associates that it would
be to their advantage also."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","Mister Spock, your friend wants you."
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",He seems to be hurt.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",You can't let him suffer.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",They should be coming soon.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",Zora!
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",Kahless!
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain","No, wait!"
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",How many do you see?
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",Zora.
GREEN,"The
Savage Curtain",Now can you cry like Lincoln?
KAHLESS,"The
Savage Curtain",Yes.
KAHLESS,"The
Savage Curtain",They've done nothing.
KAHLESS,"The
Savage Curtain","They've not armed themselves nor
prepared for any kind of defence."
KAHLESS,"The
Savage Curtain",I say attack now and finish them.
KAHLESS,"The
Savage Curtain",Better than what they have.
KAHLESS,"The
Savage Curtain",Colonel!
KAHLESS,"The
Savage Curtain","One of those peace lovers, Colonel."
KAHLESS,"The
Savage Curtain",Why don't we kill him?
KAHLESS,"The
Savage Curtain",Two.
KAHLESS,"The
Savage Curtain","(as Surak) Help me, Spock."
KAHLESS,"The
Savage Curtain","Help me, Spock."
KAHLESS,"The
Savage Curtain","(as Lincoln) Help me, Kirk."
KAHLESS,"The
Savage Curtain","Help me, Kirk!"
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","The power source we detected is in this building, Captain."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",No signs of sapient life forms.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Reports deny that they had any space flight capability.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","This
appears to be an archive or library of some kind."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Forgive me, sir."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",It is my fault.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I must have miscalculated.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Our
readings indicated that there was no one here at all."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Three hours, thirteen minutes."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Exactly what is it that I'm expected to select?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I see.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",This is a fascinating machine.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",What is it?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Interesting nomenclature.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",How does it work?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",May I
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Thank you, Mister Atoz."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Yes, and where is the captain?"
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Heating this boulder may provide some
temporary heat."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Something's preventing my phaser from operating.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Captain, we hear you, but we cannot see you."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Are you all right?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Agreed.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Apparently they've all escaped the
destruction of their world by retreating into its past."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Indeed not.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",We're in a wilderness of arctic characteristics.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","There is no library, Captain, at least not
that we can see."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",We are at the base of an ice cliff.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Just before you disappeared, Captain, I
discovered a machine which Mister Atoz called the atavachron."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Opening time portals to the past.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","You cross
through into the period which you were viewing."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","I am here, evidently, because I stepped through at the same
instant as Doctor McCoy."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Captain!
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",You must be close to the portal.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",We may be in trouble ourselves.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",We must find shelter.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","In this severe cold, we cannot survive much longer."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",We go together or not at all.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",We go together.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",He's suffering from the severity of your weather.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Unfortunately,
he is the doctor, not I. I'll avoid giving him any medication at this
time."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Perhaps, if he's kept quiet and warm, he may recover naturally."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",It is agreeably warm here.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'm called Spock.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Prisoners?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Yes, we came through the time portal, but not as prisoners."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","We
were sent here by mistake."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",That is true.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I am not from the world you know at all.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","My home
is a planet millions of light years away."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Listen to me.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I am firmly convinced that I do exist.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","I am
substantial."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",You are not imagining this.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",McCoy.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","McCoy, wake up."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","No, we are still in the Ice Age, but safe for the moment."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Doctor, you're in no condition to get up."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",You lie down and rest.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I shall attempt to find the captain.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",He's our commanding officer and our friend.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",He did not come with us.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","He was sent through the time portal to
another period in history much later than this one."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","If I am to find
him, there is only one possible avenue."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Zarabeth, will you show me
where the time portal is?"
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Yes, that is true."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","If I leave him, there's a chance he may never
regain the ship."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",He would then be marooned in this time period.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","But he
is no longer in danger of death, so my primary duty to him has been
discharged."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","If I remain here, no one of our party would be able to aid
Captain Kirk."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",It should be an equation.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","I should be able to resolve this
problem logically."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",If only I knew more about how it worked.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Zarabeth, you said that you
were brought here as a prisoner."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",May I ask
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I remember that name from the history tapes in the library.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Zor
Kahn the Tyrant."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Zarabeth, I must return to Mister Atoz and the atavachron."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","We
will carry Doctor McCoy, and you must come with us."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","I will send you and
the doctor to the ship, and I shall search for Captain Kirk."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",You cannot go back?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Come, Doctor, back to bed."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","It is impossible to look for him, Doctor."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",We cannot go back.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Zarabeth explained it to me.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","When we came through the time
portal, it altered our physiological structure."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","If we attempt to return
to the library, we shall die."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Yes, Doctor, we are trapped."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Just as Jim is trapped wherever he
is."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Really?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Doctor McCoy is making excellent progress.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the
Enterprise."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Five thousand years in the future.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Who knows.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",What was there to do?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","We've been through all that, Doctor."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","What's the point of
rehashing that subject?"
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",We can't get back.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Wasn't that clear to you?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Then perhaps you were too ill to understand what can't get back
means."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Then I'll repeat it for you.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Get this through your head.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","We
can't get back."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","That means we are trapped here in this planet's past
just as we are, and we'll stay here for the rest of our lives."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Now do
you understand?"
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I don't like that.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","I don't think I ever did, and now I'm sure."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'm sorry.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I know of no way to return you to your own time.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Yes.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I know what it is like.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",If it pleases you.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",This is animal flesh?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Naturally, because of the climate."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","What is the source of heat in
the shelter?"
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Excellent.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of
sorts."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Meanwhile, this will have to do as the only source of
nourishment."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",But he evidently intended that you continue living.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","But insensitive, to send such a beautiful woman into exile."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","The
cold must've affected me more than I realised."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Please pay no attention.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'm not myself.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'm behaving disgracefully.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","I have eaten animal flesh
and I have enjoyed it."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",What is wrong with me?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","I tell you you're
beautiful."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",But you are beautiful.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Is it so wrong to tell you so?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",You are beautiful.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've
ever known."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","I've given you the facts, Doctor."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",You were told the truth.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","If Zarabeth is the source, what
difference does it make?"
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",She would not jeopardise other lives.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",What are you doing to her?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",This is impossible.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Impossible.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I am a Vulcan.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",My ancestors are barbarians.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Warlike barbarians.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I've lost myself.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I do not know who I am.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Can we go back?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","There's no portal here, Doctor."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",It's hopeless.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",You're too ill to remain out here any longer.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Give it up.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","We hear you perfectly, Captain."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",This must be it.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","You start ahead, Doctor."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I do not wish to part from you.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",How much time do we have?
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","There's no further need to observe me, Doctor."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","As you can see,
I've returned to the present in every sense."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Yes, it happened."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",But that was five thousand years ago.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays","And she
is dead now."
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Dead and buried.
SPOCK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Long ago.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Any sign of survivors?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","If they knew that their sun was dying, it could be anything up to
mass suicide."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Then we're certainly in the right place to find out what
happened, where the inhabitants are, and if there are any left now."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Perhaps you can, Mister"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",You say everyone is gone?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Where'd they go?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",What about recent history?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","It doesn't have to be extensive, Just the answers to a few
questions."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","You're a very agile man, Mister Atoz."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Just how many of you are
there?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",We came as soon as we knew what was happening.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Did you say they were safe?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Where did they go?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I see.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","And you personally sent all these people on the planet to
safety?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","You are the real one, Mister Atoz?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Of course.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I am the real Mister Atoz.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Let us take you with us to a place of safety.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",We'll choose it as quick as we can.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",How long till nova?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",This gentleman is not
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","(Kirk hears a woman scream from behind a doorway)
 Spock."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Bones.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","I'm a free man, sir."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",What's that?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Are you all right?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",You better come back with me to the library.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","You'll be safe
there."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Doctor McCoy can see to those bruises.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",It's right over there.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",No.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Do you remember when you first saw me?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Do you remember
whether I came through some kind of door?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",No.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",No.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",It must be here someplace.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Bones?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Spock?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",We must've missed each other somehow.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","No, no."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","No, no, no."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","These are friends of mine, and they're"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Spock, are you in the library?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Can you get to the library?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Explain.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","It must have been tied in to the tape viewer
somehow."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Yes.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","(a mob approaches) My friends are coming
back with reinforcements."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",On what charge?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",That's a mistake.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'm no thief.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Keep talking!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'm a stranger.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",An island.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",It's called Earth.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I never saw that woman before tonight.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","When she screamed, as far
as I could tell, she was being attacked."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Yes, I deny it."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","I was reading in the library when I heard her
scream."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","My lord, the library?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Do you remember where the library is, my
lord?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Surely you don't believe
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","What he heard, my lord, were only my friends behind the wall in
the library."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",In the library.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","My lord, at least arrange for me to meet Mister Atoz."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Yes!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Yes!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Atoz!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Let me speak to you!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",At least let me talk to you!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Cry out and I'll break it.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Don't move.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'm being falsely accused.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",You know that.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",There are no such things as witches!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","You're the only one that can hear me, and that's the truth."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","There
are no witches."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Why do you deny it?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'll denounce you to the inquisitor.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","You came here from the
future just as I did."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Therefore, you, too, are a witch."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Then help me.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Help me return to the library.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I've lost my way.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","I must get back
there."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I tell you I must!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","I had two friends with me, who are lost in
another time period."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I must find them.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",You'll come back with us.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Prepared?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I was not prepared.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Your Mister Atoz did not prepare me
in any way."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Spock?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",McCoy?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Come in.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",How much time before the sun blows up?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","We can't, Scotty."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Spock and McCoy are missing.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",No.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Under no circumstances send anyone else here without my
orders."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Prepare to warp out and stand by.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Kirk out.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Mister Atoz, where
are you?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",No.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Mister Atoz, my friends and I are from another planet."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","We
don't belong in your history."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",We don't belong on your planet at all.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",No.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I want to find the exact disc that they were viewing.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","I'm sorry, Mister Atoz."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Mister Atoz!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'll let you out in a minute.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Still up to your little game of
replicas?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Which are you this time, real or not?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","If you help me, we won't die."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I promise you that.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Which one are you now, the replica or the real one?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","You don't really want to hurt me, do you?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","You've been trying to
save my life."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I realise that.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Put that thing away.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Now, you're going to help me look for my friends."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Kirk here.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",No time to explain.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Are you ready to warp out?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Stand by to beam us up.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","But when that star explodes, don't wait."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Get out fast.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Kirk out.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Now we're going to start looking.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","They were in
a frozen waste."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I could hear the wind.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","We'll both look, Mister Atoz."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I don’t know.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I didn't see it.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Bones?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Spock!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",McCoy!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",You've got the wrong one.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Try again.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Bones.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Spock!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I've found them.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Can you still hear me?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Follow my voice.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Spock, McCoy, follow my voice."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Do you
hear me?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Keep following my voice.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Spock.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",McCoy.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",What are you waiting for?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Hurry!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",What are you waiting for?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Hurry!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Scotty, how much time is there?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",What's the matter?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Why can't he get through?
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Spock, McCoy, you can't get through unless you both come back at
the same time."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Scotty.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",No!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Wait!
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Spock, McCoy, hurry through the portal."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Time is running out.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",He had his escape planned.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'm glad he made it.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Kirk to
Enterprise."
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays","Scotty, are you there?"
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Beam us aboard and go to maximum warp as soon as we're there.
KIRK,"All
Our Yesterdays",Kirk out.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",How can a planet full of people just disappear?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Well, that's fine."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Where do we start?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","No, no particular person, just people in general."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Where did they
go?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","As a matter of fact, he's quite real, Jim."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",What is this place?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",What's wrong?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Where's the captain, Spock?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","We were right
behind him."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Jim!
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Jim, can you hear us?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",He means it's cold.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",I was looking over some material about their Ice Age.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",What’s happening?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Jim, what's the matter?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Jim sounded like he
was in trouble."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Leave me here, Spock."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Don't be a fool.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",My hands and face are frostbitten.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","I can't feel
my feet."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Alone you have a chance.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Now do what I say.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Go try to find
Jim."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","You stubborn, thickheaded Vulcan!"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Who are you?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Zarabeth.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Spock, are we in the library?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Jim.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",What about Jim?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","You find him, Spock."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Don't you worry about me.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","You just find
him."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",(standing) Spock?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Where are we?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Yes, I remember you."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Why are you still here, Spock?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Why aren't you looking for Jim?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",What do you mean impossible?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",We've got to get back.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Are you trying to tell me that we're trapped here?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Zarabeth, you are a beautiful cook."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Have you
ever been told that?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Oh, well, you'll find that Spock is quite delinquent in those
matters."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Oh?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Well, now that I'm feeling better, you'll notice a distinct
difference in our approach."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","No, not yet."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",And Mister Spock has been practicing medicine without a license.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Don't let him doctor you.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'm the doctor around here.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",I wonder where she is.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Thank you.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",I wonder where Jim is.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","What do you mean, we can only hope?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Haven't you done anything
about it?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Locate the portal.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",It can't be too far.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Yes, that was clear to me."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","I don't believe it, Spock."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","It’s just not like you to give up
trying."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Yes, I understand."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","I never thought I'd hear it, but I
understand."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",You want to stay here.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","As a matter of fact, you're highly
motivated to stay in this forsaken waste."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","You listen to me, you pointed-eared Vulcan."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","What's happening to you, Spock?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Long ago.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Of course.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Long ago.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Spock.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","You've been dishonest with me, Spock,
and that is also something new for you."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",The facts as you know them.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Or did you just accept Zarabeth's
word because it's what you wanted to believe?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Zarabeth is a woman condemned to a terrible life of loneliness.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",She would do anything to anybody to change that.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Wouldn't you,
Zarabeth?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Did you?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",You said we can't get back.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","The truth is you can't get
back."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",She would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","She
would lie."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",She would cheat.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","She would even murder me, the captain, the
entire crew of the Enterprise to keep you here with her."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Go ahead,
Zarabeth, tell Spock the truth."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Go ahead.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Tell Spock you would kill!
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Are you trying to kill me, Spock?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Is that what you really want?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Think.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",What are you feeling?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Rage?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Jealousy?
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Have you ever had those
feelings before?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",The Vulcan you knew won't exist for another five thousand years.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Think, man."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","What's happening on your planet right now, this very
moment?"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Who nearly killed themselves off with their own passions.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Spock,
you're reverting into your ancestors five thousand years before you
were born!"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","I know I'm going to try, Spock, because my life is back there,
and I want that life."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",I suppose you're right.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",It’s Jim!
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Here we are, Jim."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Come on, Spock."
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","Come on, Spock, now!"
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays",Something's wrong.
MCCOY,"All
Our Yesterdays","But it did happen, Spock."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",May I help you?
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",I am the librarian.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",May I be of assistance?
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Mister Atoz.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",I confess that I'm a little surprised to see you.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","I
had thought that everyone had long since gone."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",But the surprise is pleasant one.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","After all, a library serves no
purpose unless someone is using it."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","It depended on the individual, of course."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","If you wish to trace a
specific person, I'm sorry, but that information is confidential."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Ah, you find it difficult to choose, is that it?"
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Yes, a wide
range of alternatives is a mixed blessing, but perhaps I can help."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Would you step this way, please?"
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",May I help you?
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","You may select from more than twenty thousand
verism tapes, several hundred of which have only recently been added to
the collection."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'm sure you'll find something here that pleases you.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","You, sir, what is your particular field of interest?"
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Really?
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Oh, that's too bad."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",We have so little on recent history.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",There was no demand for it.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Of course.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Reference services available at the desk.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",You're very late.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Where have you been?
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Of course I know.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Everyone on this planet was warned of the
coming nova long ago."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",They followed instructions and are now safe.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","And
you had better do the same."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Absolutely.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Every single one.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Wherever they wanted to go, of course."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","It is strictly up to the
individual's choice."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Yes, yes, yes."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","They are all gone, except you three."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Of course, I
had to delegate the simple tasks to my replicas."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","No, thank you."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","I plan to join my wife and family when the time
comes."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Now, don't be concerned about me."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Think of yourselves.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","I warn
you most urgently."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Make your escape before it's too late.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","The library
is at your complete service."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",I will gladly supply you with all reference material to help you.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",History of the planet is available in every detail.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Just choose what interests you the most.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","The millennium, the century,
the date, the moment."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",The library is your key.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","(puts a disc in a
reader) Oh!"
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",It's in the wrong file.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Make your own selection, but
remember, you're very late."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","You, sir."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",I think you’ll find something interesting over here.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Now, if these won't do, I can bring you another file."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Have you made your selection, sir?"
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'm sure I was clear.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",The period in which you're interested.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Ah, this is the atavachron."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Oh, no, sir, no."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","I must ask you not to touch the controlling
mechanism."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Return and make your selection.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","When you have chosen, I will
prepare you through the atavachron."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Wait!
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",I haven't prepared you.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",You must be prepared!
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",May I help you?
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",It’s you.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","You're lucky you found your way back
here."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Now let me process you through the atava
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Just let me take care of you and get you back where you belong.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Please, go back!"
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",I must prepare to escape.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",You are evidently a suicidal maniac.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","I don’t understand what
you're trying to do, but if you continue, both of us will die."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","and I
for one, do not wish death."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",I don't trust you.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",I am the real Atoz.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",You've done away with my replicas.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","I regret
what I must now do."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Just stay where you are, sir."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'll see you get to safety.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",You're a most determined man.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","All right, all right."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",All right!
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","It must be the Sarpeidon Ice
Age, five thousand years ago."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Let me look.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Do you think that's the right one?
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","If we’re to get the portal set for the proper time period, you
must be specific."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Well try calling out.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Please, there's no time left."
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",Let me go.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays",I don't know.
ATOZ,"All
Our Yesterdays","Unless, it's because they originally went through
the portal together."
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",You dirty thing.
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Let go of me!
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Oh, thank you, man."
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays","I thought I'd be
limbered sure when that gull caught me cutting his purse."
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Oh, I took you to be an angler, but you're none of us, are ya?"
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Well, you're a bully fine coe for all of that."
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays","What a handsome dish ya
served them, the coxcombs."
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays","I'm game, love."
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Lead and I'll follow.
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Where's library?
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays","What's with you, man?"
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Let's make off before
coxcombs come with shoulder clappers."
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Oh, I think the rum gull must've kicked you in the head."
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Come
on, love."
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",I know a leech who'll ask no questions.
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Mercy on us.
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",It's spirits.
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",It's spirits.
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",He's a witch!
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",He speaks to unseen spirits.
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",He's a witch!
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",You heard the voices!
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",You're a witch.
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",He cast a spell.
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays","He made me steal against my
wish."
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Witch!
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Witch!
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Witch!
WENCH,"All
Our Yesterdays",They'll burn ya.
MAN,"All
Our Yesterdays",Vile vixen!
MAN,"All
Our Yesterdays","Come when you are bidden, slave!"
MAN,"All
Our Yesterdays","(Kirk pushes him down) You need a
lesson in how to use your betters."
MAN,"All
Our Yesterdays",Who's your master?
MAN,"All
Our Yesterdays",There's the mort's accomplice.
MAN,"All
Our Yesterdays",Arrest him.
MAN,"All
Our Yesterdays",They speak at his bidding.
MAN,"All
Our Yesterdays",Stop his mouth and they'll quiet.
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays","We are the law, and do require that you yield to us."
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays",Thievery and purse cutting.
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays",Lord help us.
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays",What's that?
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays",Away.
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays","Away, spirit, and let honest men approach."
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays",Here.
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays",There's the mort.
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays","And there's the mort's
henchman."
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays","It's truth, my lord."
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays",I heard the spirit talk to him.
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays","He answered
and did call it Bones."
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays","Aye, my lord."
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'll witness to it.
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays","No supper for you, love."
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays","(lets the wench out
of her cell) Come on."
LAW,"All
Our Yesterdays",Up you go.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",What are you called?
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Even your name is strange.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Forgive me.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","I've never seen anyone
who looks like you."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Why are you here?
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Are you prisoners too?
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","This is one of the places Zor Kahn sends people when he wants
them to disappear."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Didn't you come in through the time portal?
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","The atavachron is far away, but I think you come from
someplace farther than that."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Oh, how wonderful!"
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","I've always loved books about such
possibilities."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",But they are only stories.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",This isn't real.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","I must be
imagining all this."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",I'm going mad!
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Oh, I've been here for so long, alone."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","When I saw you out
there, I couldn't believe it."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Is he dying?
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",My name is Zarabeth.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Spock, who is this Jim?"
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",I saw only the two of you.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",I did not know there was another.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",But your friend.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",He is ill.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",You make it sound like an equation.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Why?
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",My crime was in choosing my kinsmen unwisely.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Two of
them were involved in a conspiracy to kill Zor Kahn."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",It was not enough that he execute my kinsmen.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Zor Kahn
determined to destroy our entire family."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","He used the atavachron to send
us places no one could ever find us."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",I can't go through the portal again.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","If I do, I will die."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",None of us can go back.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","When we come through the portal, we
are changed by the atavachron."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",That is its function.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Our basic cell
structure is adjusted to the time we enter."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",You can't go back.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","If you
go through the portal again, you will die by the time you reach the
other side."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","You are safe here, McCoy."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Not recently.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",I hadn't noticed it.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",It’s something to look forward to.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","I think you must be well
enough, Doctor, to try the few delicacies this climate has to offer."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","At your rate of progress, it will be soon, I can see."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","I cannot pretend to be sorry that you are
here, though I realise it is a misfortune for you."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","I'm here against my
will too, just as you are."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",It's not that I wish to return.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",This is my time now.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","I've had
to face that."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",But it has been lonely here.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Do you know what it's like
to be alone?"
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Really alone?
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",I believe you do.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Have something to eat, please."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","There's not much else to eat around here, I'm afraid."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",There's an underground hot spring.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",There aren't many luxuries around here.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Zor Kahn only left me
what was necessary to survive."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",Yes.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","He gave me weapons, a shelter, food."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","Everything I needed
to live except companionship."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","He did not want it said that he had me
killed."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","But to send me here alone, if that is not death, what is?"
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","A
very inventive mind, that man."
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",I have longed to hear you say it.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",I told you what I know.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",I don't know.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",I only know that I can't go back.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays",I cannot come.
ZARABETH,"All
Our Yesterdays","If I go back, I will die."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Open up.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Rouse him.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",You're the thief who talks to spirits.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Where are you from?
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",What is this island?
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",I know no island Earth.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",No matter.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Continue.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Then you deny being her accomplice?
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Perhaps your part in this is innocent.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","I believe you to be an
honest man."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","Take care, woman."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",I am convinced of your guilt.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","Do not compound
it with false accusation."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",You heard these spirits?
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",I know nothing of this.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","Send for someone learned in witchcraft
and let him examine him."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",I will have nothing to do with it.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",I know of no Atoz.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","I know nothing of this, nothing of these matters!"
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","I will not
hear him!"
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",I will not hear him.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Jailor!
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Jailor!
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",You will come with me before the inquisitional tribunal.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","There
the matter of your witchcraft will be decided."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Jailor!
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",That is sacrilege.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","If they hear you, they will burn you
for such beliefs."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Do not let them hear you.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",There are witches!
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",There are!
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","You
yourself may be discovered to be a witch by the inquisitor."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",No!
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","What
are you doing?"
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",No!
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Help!
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Help!
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",I beg you.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Do not implicate me.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",They would burn me.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",I will do everything I can to prove you innocent.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","I will
disprove all the charges of witchcraft."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","But you must never again speak
to the comrades you left behind."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",You cannot get back.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",We can never go back.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","We must live out our lives here in the
past."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","The atavachron has prepared our cell structure and our brain
patterns to make life natural here."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","To return to the future would mean
instant death."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Then you must get back at once!
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays","If you were not transformed, you
can only survive for a few hours here in the past."
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Come.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Hurry.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",Hurry.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",This is where it is.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",I can't remember the exact spot.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",That's it!
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",That is the portal.
JUDGE,"All
Our Yesterdays",I cannot wait any longer.
JAILOR,"All
Our Yesterdays",Give me your cup.
SCOTT,"All
Our Yesterdays","Scott here, Captain."
SCOTT,"All
Our Yesterdays",Seventeen minutes.
SCOTT,"All
Our Yesterdays","You three had better come back right
away."
SCOTT,"All
Our Yesterdays",I knew there was trouble.
SCOTT,"All
Our Yesterdays","I've got a landing party standing
by."
SCOTT,"All
Our Yesterdays",What's happening?
SCOTT,"All
Our Yesterdays",Why are you waiting?
SCOTT,"All
Our Yesterdays","Aye, Captain."
SCOTT,"All
Our Yesterdays",You've got to come aboard now.
SCOTT,"All
Our Yesterdays","Orders or no, I'm beaming you up first."
SCOTT,"All
Our Yesterdays","Now or never, Captain."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,What's wrong with her?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Janice, you must remain absolutely quiet."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Those are doctor's orders, not mine."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I don't blame you.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I never stopped you from going on with your space work.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"No, it isn't."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,And you punished and tortured me because of it.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,We'd have killed each other.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"You had your chance, Captain Kirk."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You should've smothered the life in me.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Then they would have said Doctor Janice Lester died of radiation poisoning in the line of duty.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Why didn't you do it?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You always wanted to.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Didn't you?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You had the strength to do it.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,But you were afraid.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You were always afraid.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Now Janice Lester takes the place of Captain Kirk.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I already possess your physical strength.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Only this Captain Kirk is not afraid to kill.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Now you know the indignity of being a woman.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"For you this agony will soon pass, as it has for me."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Quiet.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Quiet!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Believe me, it's better to be dead than to live alone in the body of a woman."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,It's better to be dead.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor McCoy, your report."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Was it radiation as suggested?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"No, nothing at all."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,She was unconscious all of the time.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Perhaps the shock of knowing what happened to her staff is part of her problem.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Captain Kirk to the Enterprise.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Captain Kirk to the Enterprise.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Mister Scott.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Prepare to beam the landing party aboard plus two others.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,One critically ill. Have a medical team standing by to receive the patient.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Captain Kirk, out."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Prepare to beam aboard.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor Coleman, accompany the patient to the Sickbay."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Spock, take the ship out of orbit."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Resume designated course.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor McCoy, you and Doctor Coleman seem to disagree on diagnosis."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Will it affect your arriving at a correct treatment?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Well, this is especially disturbing to me for personal reasons."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Oh, yes."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,It's been a long time since I saw her.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I walked out on her when it became serious.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Youth doesn't excuse everything, Doctor McCoy."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,It's a very unhappy memory for me.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Thank you.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Thank you very much.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Yes, very lucky."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Very lucky.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Well you'd better put a stop to it!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,If you allow Doctor Lester to become fully conscious she'll know what has happened.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Probably?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I tell you it can't continue.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,There wasn't enough time.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,He hung onto life too hard.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I couldn't
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Love?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Him?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I love the life he led.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,The power of a starship commander.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,It's my life now.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You are a murderer!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You knew it was celebium.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You could've treated them for it.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You're a murderer many times over.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I thought my presence might quiet Doctor Lester.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,It seems to have had the opposite effect.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Didn't Doctor Lester's staff become delirious before they went off and died?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor Coleman, Doctor McCoy has had a great deal of experience with radiation exposure on board the Enterprise."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I am guided by his opinion.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor McCoy, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to take you off the case and turn it over to Doctor Coleman."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor Coleman wants to assume the full responsibility.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Let him do it.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,It's done!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor Coleman, your patient."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor Coleman, didn't you suggest a sedation to rest the patient?"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor Coleman.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,James Kirk is returning to consciousness in the body of Janice Lester.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"The Enterprise is proceeding to its next mission, on the course set before I took over command."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Now the years I spent studying every single detail of the ship's operation will be tested.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"With a little experience, I will be invulnerable to suspicion."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,At last I attain what is my just due.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Command of a starship.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,All the months of preparation now come to fruition.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Course, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Sulu, set speed at warp factor two."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Chekov, plot a course for the Benecia Colony."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,How long to the colony at our present speed?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Sulu, set course for the colony."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Three seven three mark eight.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Yes, it can't be helped."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,We must take Doctor Lester to a place where she can be treated.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,How long to Starbase Two?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,It's twenty four hours too long.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor Lester's condition is increasingly serious.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Continue present course.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,They will have to serve.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Thank you, Mister Spock, but the facilities will be of little use if Doctor Lester's dead."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Time is of the essence.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Continue present course.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"No change of plan has been ordered, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Our arrival at Beta Aurigae will merely be delayed.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Our gravitational studies of that binary system will not suffer, and a life may be saved!"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,That is not unusual procedure for the Enterprise.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Spock, if you’d concentrate on the areas for which you are responsible, Starfleet Command would've been informed already."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Inform Starfleet of the delay, Lieutenant."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Continue present course.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Increase speed to warp factor six.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Why are you being so defensive?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,There's no implied criticism of you in my order to remove you from the case.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,That's the opinion of an individual.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,There are no administrative duties required here.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Promotions and demotions can be politically manoeuvred.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"You know that, Bones."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I'm afraid the order will have to stand.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I can only say that Doctor Coleman's experience with what happened on the planet had to be the deciding factor here.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I’m sure that you can appreciate that.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,What?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,What do you base that on?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You'll never make that charge stick.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Any fool can see why you're doing this.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I won't submit to this petty search for revenge!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Captain Kirk here.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I'll be right there.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Well, gentlemen."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"I'm here, Doctor."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,She might have killed someone.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Put her in isolation in her room.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Maintain a twenty four hour watch.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"No one, absolutely no one, is to talk to her without my permission!"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,How am I otherwise?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Good.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I hope you're as pleased about it as I am.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You said I was in perfect condition.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I don't think another test is necessary.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Well, are you satisfied with the results of the tests?"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"No hard feelings, Bones."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"You did your usual thorough, good job."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Captain Kirk here.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Captain Kirk to Security.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,On the double to Doctor Lester's room!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Phasers.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Attention, all personnel."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,First Officer Spock has been placed under arrest.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,He has conspired with Doctor Lester to take over the ship from your captain.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,A hearing will be immediately convened to consider the charges and specifications of a general court martial on the charge of mutiny.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,She's dangerously insane.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,We've seen the evidence.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Mister Spock.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Spock, my authority has been given to me by Starfleet Command, and only that high authority can take it away."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Lemli, have Doctor Janice Lester brought here."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor McCoy, while Mister Spock was busy with his ambitious plot, what were you doing?"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Oh, yes."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"You were deeply concerned about my health, emotional and physical, since leaving Camus Two."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Is that correct?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Instead of trying to destroy me, you were searching for ways to help me."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor McCoy, for the record, will you tell the court your findings?"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Thank you, Doctor McCoy."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Spock, were you aware of Doctor McCoy's findings?"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,And what have you to say now?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor Coleman, if you’re required here, we'll call you."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,We certainly appreciate your being here.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Everyone is deeply aware that you have been subjected to inordinate emotional stress.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"We had hoped to avoid any further stress, but Mister Spock disagrees."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,It is his opinion that your testimony is important in determining the merits of his case.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"And since we are solely interested in arriving at a just decision, I'm going to have to ask you a few more questions."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I'll try not to upset you.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"You claim that, that you are Captain James T. Kirk?"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Oh.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Well.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"However, as I understand it, I am Doctor Janice Lester."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,A subtlety that somehow escapes me.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I assume that this switch was arrived at by mutual agreement.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Violence by the lady, perpetrated on Captain Kirk?"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I ask the assembled personnel to look at Doctor Janice Lester and visualise that historic moment.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Can you, can you tell me why Doctor Janice Lester would agree to this ludicrous exchange?"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Are you prepared with witnesses?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,One will do.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Spock, have you ever heard of a case such as described by Doctor Janice Lester?"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Oh.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Assuming that you are correct in your belief, do you expect Starfleet Command to place this er, this er, person in command of the Enterprise?"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"And with the truth revealed, that I am not really the captain, and knowing that she would not be allowed to serve as the captain, then you would be the captain!"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,It is inevitable!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Spock.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Spock, give it up!"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Return to the Enterprise family.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,All charges will be dropped and the madness that temporarily overcame all of us on Camus Two will fade and be forgotten.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor Lester will be cared for always.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,It is a debt and a responsibility I owe her from the past.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Lieutenant Lysa, play back those last two sentences from Mister Spock's tirade."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You heard the statements placed into the record by you.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Do you understand the nature of it?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,(thumping the table) It is mutiny!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Deliberate, vindictive, insane at its base!"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"But mutiny is charged, and encouragement to mutiny."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor McCoy, Mister Scott, you heard it!"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"On the basis of these statements, I call for an immediate vote, by the powers granted to me as captain of the Enterprise."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"A recess is declared, to be followed by a vote."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Silence.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You will be silent!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,A recess has been declared.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,There will be no cross-discussion.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"When I return, we will vote on the charge of mutiny."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,The evidence presented here is the only basis of your decision.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Play the tapes of the conversation in the corridor.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Enough to convict you of conspiracy with mutineers.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,And you're so charged.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"The sentence, death."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Mister Lemli.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,All my senior officers turning against me?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I am responsible.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,The execution will be immediate.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Go to your posts.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Go to your posts.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Lemli, take them to the brig."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Prepare for execution.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Go on!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Lieutenant Lysa, inform all sectors of my decision."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Have each section send a representative to the place of execution on the hangar deck.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Chekov, how far to the Benecia Colony?"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Plot co-ordinates for orbit.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Sulu, lock into co-ordinates as soon as orbit is accomplished."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Interment will take place on Benecia.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You have received your orders!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You will obey my orders.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You’ll be charged with mutiny!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"You will obey my orders or, or,"
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Arthur, the transference is weakening."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"For a moment, I found myself back with the prisoners."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I will not go back to being Janice Lester.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You must help me prevent it.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I can't.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I can't.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,The crew is in mutiny.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,You must kill her for me.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Then do it for yourself.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"If Kirk doesn't die, we'll both be exposed as murderers."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Does that give you any choice?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,The dosage should be doubly lethal.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"To prevent further conspiracy, you will be removed to separate cells."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"If there’s any resistance, you'll be given a sedative until you learn co-operation."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor Lester will be first.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Follow Doctor Coleman.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Kill him!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Kill him!
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,Can you do anything for her?
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,I didn't want to destroy her.
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,"Her life could have been as rich as any woman's, if only."
KIRK,Turnabout Intruder,If only.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,Exposure to radiation.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,Nothing I've ever encountered.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor McCoy.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor Lester is near death.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,I'm sure it is.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,I don't know.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,I'm not sure.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,It just began.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,Probably no one will believe it.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,That's all we can ask for.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,How can death be explained now?
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,You killed every one of the staff.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,You sent them where you knew the celebium shielding was weak.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,Now why didn't you kill him?
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,You had the perfect opportunity.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,I gave you every minute you asked for.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,You couldn't because you love him.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,You want me to be his murderer.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,I won't become a murderer.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,It has nothing to do with you.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,It's a symptom of the developing radiation illness.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,"Yes, Captain."
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,Yes.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor Lester and her staff have been under my supervision for two years.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,"If you don't follow my recommendations, responsibility for her health or her death will be yours."
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,"Yes, Captain."
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,"Nurse, administer the sedative."
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,"Nurse Chapel, you have your orders."
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,Quiet would be best for you.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,I'm in charge now.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,He was taken off your case by Captain Kirk.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,"It was done for your own protection, Doctor Lester."
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,She is suffering from the delusion of being Captain Kirk.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,The paranoia has been developing for the past six months.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,The radiation seems to have intensified it.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,She must be kept sedated.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,Of course.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,"You are insane, Doctor Lester."
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,What happened?
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,The only way to prevent the transference is by the death of Janice Lester.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,You must carry out the execution.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,I have done everything else for you.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,But I will not murder for you.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,It is.
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,"You are, you are as I loved you."
COLEMAN,Turnabout Intruder,I'd like to take care of her.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,What form of radiation was it?
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Perhaps your presence will quiet her.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"We were too late, Jim."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,There's nothing could be done.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"No, I believe it was celebium."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"However, Doctor Coleman disagrees."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,To be specific is essential because the treatment of celebium is quite
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Did you notice any unusual symptoms while we were gone?
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Beaming her up to the Enterprise will be less harmful than waiting.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"No, not entirely."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,We both agree it's radiation.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor Coleman isn't prepared to say what form of radiation.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,It's crucial.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Oh?
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I didn't know you knew her that well.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Well, you must have been very young at the time, Jim."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I didn't realise that.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I shall do everything in my power.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Jim, what are you doing here?"
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Tests with the ship's equipment shows no signs of internal radiation damage, Doctor Coleman."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor Lester could be suffering from a phaser stun as far as the symptoms I can detect, Jim."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,You can't do this!
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,On this ship my medical authority is final!
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I won't allow it.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"It's not necessary, Jim."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Can't you see she's coming around?
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"A sedative is not wise at this time, Captain."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Nurse Chapel, follow your instructions."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I'll let my record speak for me.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,That is not the reason I'm here.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I'm here because Doctor Coleman's record states that he's incompetent.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"No, sir."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,That is the opinion of Starfleet Command.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I checked with them.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor Coleman was removed from his post as Chief Medical Officer of his ship for administrative incompetence.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,As well as flagrant medical blunders.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Not in Starfleet Headquarters, Captain."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,And certainly not in the Surgeon General's office.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I appreciate the fact that you had a decision to make.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"I also find myself in that position now, Jim, and I'm asking you to report for an examination."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Development of emotional instability and erratic mental attitudes since returning from that planet.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I'll let Starfleet Command be the judge of my motives.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"But you will submit to Starfleet regulations, and they state that the ship surgeon will require full examination of any crew member that he has doubts about, including the captain."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,These tests should help me pinpoint the cause of Jim’s illness.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Yes, well what worries me most is that Jim seems completely unaware that something is wrong with him."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,We've got to make him realise that something serious is happening before treatment can even begin.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,One of us should be able to get to him.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"I keep looking for an approach, but the speed at which the illness has traveled makes it doubly difficult."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"You know headquarters, Spock."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,They're only interested in results of specific tests.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,So far all we have to offer are our opinions.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I'll use my medical authority to enforce it if necessary.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Well, then, so be it."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Our responsibility is clear.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Well, it's worth a try."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Why don't you try to get to Doctor Lester while I examine Jim.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Jim!
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Captain.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,That's enough.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,That's enough.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Your heart will last forever, Captain."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"In the pink, as usual."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Liver, kidney, blood count, metabolic rate."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Everything, even your glands, functioning at their usual, normal peak of efficiency."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Don't get dressed yet.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Physically.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,The Robbiani dermal-optic is crucial.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,It reveals the basic emotional structure.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,You had one once before.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Now I need another one to compare with that previous test.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,There should be no change in your dermal-optic reactions to the colour wavelengths.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Over here, Captain."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Over here, Captain."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Now lower your arms and open your eyes.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,There is no positive evidence of any disorder.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I'm sure everything's going to be all right.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Examining you.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"Yes, that's correct."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,The captain is in the best of physical condition.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,His emotional and mental state is comparable to the time that he assumed command of the Enterprise.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Scotty.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I've been through this with Spock.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,He's not being scientific and neither are you.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Don't you think I know that?
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,My tests show there's nothing wrong with the captain.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Now that's the only fact Starfleet's going to be interested in.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I don't know.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,We don't know that.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"We're talking about mutiny, Scotty."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Yes.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,I'm ready for the vote.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,"We're talking about mutiny, Scotty."
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,That's enough.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,We know what was said.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Then it's possible the transference can be broken.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Of course.
MCCOY,Turnabout Intruder,Come with me.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Captain.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Tricorder picking up very faint life readings.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Approximately seven hundred metres from here.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Help will have to be immediate.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"Captain, that will delay our work at Beta Aurigae."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,It means reversing course.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,May I point out that Starbase Two is on the direct route to our destination.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"If the diagnosis of Doctor Lester's illness is the critical problem, then the Benecia Colony is definitely not the place for her."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Their medical facilities are the most primitive.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Starbase Two is fully equipped and staffed with the necessary specialists to determine exactly what is wrong with the doctor.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Is that not crucial to your decision?
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"At maximum speed, Starbase Two would still meet the emergency."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"Sir, I believe Starfleet will have to be notified that our rendezvous with the starship Potemkin will not take place as scheduled."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"Since the captain usually deals with Starfleet in these matters, I assumed that my suggestions might be deemed interference."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Good.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Knowledge of the captain's aberrant behaviour is spreading through the ship.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,The crew is becoming increasingly tense.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"I'm afraid that is a forlorn hope, Doctor."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,The illness appears to be primarily mental.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Perhaps the Surgeon General's office should be alerted.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Are you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his present state of mind?
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor, we are treading on very thin ground."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Actions such as these might be misinterpreted.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Whatever happened to the captain on that planet must've taken place in the short space of time that he was alone with Doctor Lester.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Perhaps a conversation with her might shed some light.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,How is the doctor?
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Good.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,I have questions to ask her.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Why should he?
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"They are my questions, therefore I am ordering it, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Has such an order ever included his senior officers?
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"By all means, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Complete life-entity transfer with the aid of a mechanical device?
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"To my knowledge, such total transfer has never been accomplished with complete success anywhere in the galaxy."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,That is your claim.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"As yet, it is unsubstantiated by any external evidence or objective tests."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,At this moment Doctor McCoy is examining the captain for psychological changes.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"If any facts are uncovered, that would be acceptable evidence."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,The only kind which is acceptable to Starfleet Command and to the crew of the Enterprise.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,That is true.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,The captain did not.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"However, those events have been recorded."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,They could have become known to you.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,I believe you.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"However, my belief is not acceptable evidence."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Evidence must be factual.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor McCoy may be of help.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Come with me.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,He is not the captain.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"Certainly, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,We all must do our duty.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"It's quite all right, Ensign."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Everything is under control.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"A repetition of your physical violence is not called for, sir."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,No physical resistance will be offered.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,I have stated my evidence.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Telepathic communication with the mind of Captain James T. Kirk.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"You've had great deal of evidence, except that of the chief witness."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,The one who should be the real subject of this investigation is kept locked away and in isolation.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"Why, Captain?"
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"She is dangerous only to your authority, sir."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"The witness, sir."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Bring on the witness.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Let your officers put the questions.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,I know them now.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,I am disappointed and deeply concerned that there is no objective evidence to support my position.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,So far.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"Sir, there is only one issue here."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Is the story of life-entity transfer believable?
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,This crew has been to many places in the galaxy.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,They've been witness to many strange events.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"They are trained to know that what seems to be impossible often is possible, given the scientific analysis of the phenomenon."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"Not precisely, no."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,I expect only to reveal the truth.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,And what will become of Doctor Lester?
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"No, sir."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,I shall not withdraw a single charge that I have made.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,You are not Captain Kirk.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"You have ruthlessly appropriated his body, but the life entity within you is not that of Captain Kirk."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,I do.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,And I stand by it.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,An immediate vote before our chief witness can be left to die on some obscure planet with the truth locked away inside of her.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,Perhaps you were.
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"To accomplish that, each one of us must be ready to seize any opportunity to break out of here and attack."
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"May I point out, Captain"
SPOCK,Turnabout Intruder,"I'm sure we all understand that, Captain."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I hoped I wouldn't see you again.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,The year we were together at Starfleet is the only time in my life I was alive.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Your world of starship captains doesn't admit women.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,It isn't fair.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I loved you.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,We could've roamed among the stars.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,It might have been better.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Oh no.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Am I really losing command of the Enterprise?
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,No.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"Oh, no."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Bad dream.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Bad dream.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"Pulse, pressure, blood count, all body functions normal."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Then why am I here?
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor McCoy?
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor McCoy
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Where's Doctor McCoy?
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Bring Doctor McCoy at once!
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,He is in command of medicine on this ship.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,By Captain Kirk?
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I am not Janice Lester!
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,She did this to me!
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Now how can I make you understand?
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"Janice has driven herself mad with jealousy, hatred and ambition."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Nurse Chapel.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Bring Mister Spock and Doctor McCoy to me at once.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Now they must believe I am not Janice Lester.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"I am imprisoned in her body, but I am not Janice Lester."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I am not Janice Lester!
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I must've sounded quite mad to you before.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"Well, I'll be all right now."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Could I see your Doctor McCoy?
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Oh.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Is a visit by that very kind Mister Spock to be allowed?
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,The Benecia Colony?
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,But isn't the Enterprise going to rendezvous with the Potemkin at Beta Aurigae?
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"Well, I'll try."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Thank you.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"Oh, it is good."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Thank you.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"Could I finish it slowly, Nurse Chapel?"
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I promise I'll be good.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Spock.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Bones.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Help me.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Don't let them lock me away from you.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I've got to talk to you.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"Yes, that's what it must've been."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,It was accomplished and forgotten long ago on Camus Two.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I am a living example.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"Nevertheless, Spock, it is the truth I'm speaking."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"Spock, when I was caught in the interspace of the"
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,You are closer to the captain than anyone in the universe.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,You know his thoughts.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,What does your telepathic mind tell you now?
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,No.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I am not Captain Kirk.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,That is very apparent.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I claim that whatever it is that makes James Kirk a living being special to himself is being held here in this body.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"That's very clever, but I didn't say it."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"I said, the body of James Kirk is being used by Doctor Janice Lester."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,No.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,It was brought about by a violent attack by Doctor Lester and the use of equipment she discovered on Camus Two.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Yes.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"To get the power she craved, to attain a position she doesn't merit by temperament or training."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"And most of all, she wanted to murder James Kirk, a man who once loved her."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,But her intense hatred of her own womanhood made life with her impossible.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"For a moment, I thought that I was up on the bridge."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"Well, if it happens again, I'll fight to stay there."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Ohh!
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I've lost to the captain.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I've lost to James Kirk!
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I want you dead!
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I want you dead!
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,I want you dead!
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,"Oh, I'm never going to be the captain."
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Never.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Kill him.
JANICE,Turnabout Intruder,Kill him.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Scott, sir."
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor Lester is certainly a very lucky young person to have escaped.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,Surely you must have more than that to go on.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,Your evidence is completely subjective.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,We have to have evidence that we can examine out in the open.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,Doctor.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,"Doctor, I've seen the captain feverish, sick, drunk, delirious, terrified, overjoyed, boiling mad."
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,But up to now I have never seen him red-faced with hysteria.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,I know how I'm going to vote.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,"It may not be scientific, but if Mister Spock thinks it happened, then it must be logical."
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,"Headquarters has its problems, and we have ours."
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,"And right now, the captain of the Enterprise is our problem."
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,They're going to call for the vote in a few minutes.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,Let me put one last question.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,"Suppose you vote with me, in favour of Spock."
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,That means two votes to one and Spock is free.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,What do you think the captain'll do?
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,"Aye, you know, all right."
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,It'll stick in his craw.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,He'll never accept it.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,"I tell you, he won't."
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,"Then, Doctor, that's the time we move against him."
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,We'll have to take over the ship.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,Aye.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,Are you ready for the vote?
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,Then's the time we move against him.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,We’ll have to take over the ship.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,Aye.
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,Are you ready for the vote?
SCOTT,Turnabout Intruder,The bridge is where you belong.
CHEKOV,Turnabout Intruder,One two seven mark eight.
CHEKOV,Turnabout Intruder,"Direct course to Benecia, three seven three mark eight."
CHEKOV,Turnabout Intruder,"Forty-eight hours, sir."
CHEKOV,Turnabout Intruder,"Seventy two hours, Captain."
CHEKOV,Turnabout Intruder,Starfleet expressly forbids the death penalty.
CHEKOV,Turnabout Intruder,General Order Four.
CHEKOV,Turnabout Intruder,It has not been violated by any officer on the Enterprise.
CHEKOV,Turnabout Intruder,Captain Kirk wouldn't order an execution even if he were going mad.
CHEKOV,Turnabout Intruder,That cannot be the captain.
CHEKOV,Turnabout Intruder,"If security backs him up, how will we fight him?"
CHEKOV,Turnabout Intruder,Coming within scanning range.
SULU,Turnabout Intruder,"Warp factor two, sir."
SULU,Turnabout Intruder,"Aye, sir."
SULU,Turnabout Intruder,Three seven three mark eight.
SULU,Turnabout Intruder,"Aye, sir."
SULU,Turnabout Intruder,"Sulu here, Captain."
SULU,Turnabout Intruder,Starfleet Command is requesting additional details on the delay.
SULU,Turnabout Intruder,The death penalty is forbidden.
SULU,Turnabout Intruder,There's only one exception.
SULU,Turnabout Intruder,The captain really must be going mad if he thinks he can get away with an execution.
SULU,Turnabout Intruder,What difference does it make who he is?
SULU,Turnabout Intruder,Are we going to allow an execution to take place?
SULU,Turnabout Intruder,I'll fight them every way and any way I can.
LYSA,Turnabout Intruder,"Captain, shall I advise Starfleet Command of the change of plan?"
LYSA,Turnabout Intruder,"Aye, sir."
LYSA,Turnabout Intruder,"Aye, sir."
CHAPEL,Turnabout Intruder,"Shall prepare a mild sedative, Doctor?"
CHAPEL,Turnabout Intruder,What you've been through would've completely broken most of us.
CHAPEL,Turnabout Intruder,I'm afraid that's against Doctor Coleman's orders.
CHAPEL,Turnabout Intruder,Perhaps that can be arranged before we reach the Benecia Colony.
CHAPEL,Turnabout Intruder,"Well, first we have to let you recuperate at Benecia."
CHAPEL,Turnabout Intruder,(offering a drink) You'll feel better if you have a little.
CHAPEL,Turnabout Intruder,Well
CHAPEL,Turnabout Intruder,"Well, I'll be right back."
CHAPEL,Turnabout Intruder,I'm glad you're feeling so much better.
GALLOWAY,Turnabout Intruder,"Yes, sir."
GALLOWAY,Turnabout Intruder,She regained consciousness very quickly.
GALLOWAY,Turnabout Intruder,"Did the captain order it, sir?"
GALLOWAY,Turnabout Intruder,The captain said no one is allowed to speak to Doctor Lester.
GALLOWAY,Turnabout Intruder,"No, sir."
GALLOWAY,Turnabout Intruder,"Mister Spock, I think the captain meant that a guard should be present."
GALLOWAY,Turnabout Intruder,"I’m sorry, sir, but Doctor Lester cannot leave here."
GALLOWAY,Turnabout Intruder,You're asking me to violate the captain's orders.
GALLOWAY,Turnabout Intruder,You're as mad as she is.
GALLOWAY,Turnabout Intruder,You're to leave here at once.
GALLOWAY,Turnabout Intruder,I follow orders.
GALLOWAY,Turnabout Intruder,Security guard!
ENSIGN,Turnabout Intruder,Captain Kirk!
ENSIGN,Turnabout Intruder,Escape attempt by Doctor Lester.
LEMLI,Turnabout Intruder,"Aye, sir."
