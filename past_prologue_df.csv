"It's Doctor Bashir, isn't it?",GARAK
Of course it is.,GARAK
May I introduce myself?,GARAK
My name is Garak.,GARAK
"Cardassian by birth, obviously.",GARAK
"The only one of us left on this station, as a matter of fact, so I do appreciate making new friends whenever I can.",GARAK
"You are new to this station, I believe.",GARAK
"Ah, you know of me then.",GARAK
What a thoughtful young man.,GARAK
How nice that we've met.,GARAK
You don't say?,GARAK
"Doctor, you're not intimating that I'm considered some sort of spy, are you?",GARAK
Ah.,GARAK
An open mind.,GARAK
The essence of intellect.,GARAK
"As you may also know, I have a clothing shop nearby, so if you should require any apparel, or merely wish, as I do, for a bit of enjoyable company now and then, I'm at your disposal, Doctor.",GARAK
"Oh, it's just Garak.",GARAK
"Plain, simple Garak.",GARAK
"Now, good day to you, Doctor.",GARAK
I'm so glad to have made such an interesting new friend today.,GARAK
Plain and simple.,GARAK
"Join me, Doctor.",GARAK
Enhance my evening.,GARAK
"As a clothier, I do have a keen interest in what the population is wearing from day to day.",GARAK
"Klingons have an odd sense of style, don't you agree?",GARAK
But intriguing.,GARAK
I would say that those two outfits are worth studying closely.,GARAK
Look.,GARAK
"At your service, madam.",GARAK
May I show you our latest fashions?,GARAK
Perhaps some silk lingerie from Kraus Four?,GARAK
I meant no offence.,GARAK
I have few Klingon patrons.,GARAK
"So, is there something you wish to buy?",GARAK
I am only a simple clothing merchant.,GARAK
You are in a position to deliver the Bajoran to Cardassian authorities?,GARAK
"Ladies, ladies, please.",GARAK
Everything is negotiable.,GARAK
"I am no more than what I seem to be, a merchant trying to make the best transaction.",GARAK
"So, let us haggle.",GARAK
"Being observant, Doctor.",GARAK
"There's a time for levity, my young friend, and a time for genuine concern.",GARAK
"The arrival on this station, for instance, of those two Kohn-Ma terrorists.",GARAK
I'm not exactly sure.,GARAK
"But together, we might have some success at finding out.",GARAK
"And once you do have the appropriate answer, I'm sure you'll know what to do with it.",GARAK
"Doctor, I think it's time for you to take advantage of my shop.",GARAK
"If you'll be there at exactly twenty fifty five hours tonight, I promise to show you a suit that will make you into a new man.",GARAK
"Doctor, am I making myself clear?",GARAK
"I want you to buy a new suit tonight at twenty fifty five, exactly.",GARAK
"Quickly, Doctor, you're late.",GARAK
It's twenty fifty seven.,GARAK
"Now just take this and try that on as many times as you like, and stay very, very quiet.",GARAK
"OC]: Ah, right on time.",GARAK
Welcome.,GARAK
"OC]: I can now venture to say, with some certainty, that you will receive the agreed-upon payment on delivery.",GARAK
And what business might that be?,GARAK
"If it requires that those I represent must take extra precautions, it becomes my concern.",GARAK
"A rare crystalline element, that can be an incredibly powerful source of energy.",GARAK
"Provided, of course, one also has an anti-matter converter.",GARAK
"Unfortunately, that's why Cardassians were chasing Tahna Los when he arrived here.",GARAK
He stole one.,GARAK
"Quite right, Doctor.",GARAK
He has the ingredients for a bomb.,GARAK
A bomb of significant destructive capability.,GARAK
"Er, yes, yes, of course.",BASHIR
"I am, yes.",BASHIR
"Though, though I understand you've been here quite a while.",BASHIR
Would you care for some of this Tarkalean tea?,BASHIR
It's very good.,BASHIR
"You know, some people say that you remained on DS Nine as the eyes and ears of your fellow Cardassians.",BASHIR
"I wouldn't know, sir.",BASHIR
"You're very kind, Mister Garak.",BASHIR
You won't never believe who just sat down next to me at the Replimat,BASHIR
The spy!,BASHIR
"Garak, the Cardassian.",BASHIR
He is.,BASHIR
You should have heard him.,BASHIR
He introduced himself and he struck up conversation just like that.,BASHIR
"he was making contact with me, with me of all people.",BASHIR
I don't know.,BASHIR
Federation medical secrets?,BASHIR
"Rest assured they're safe with me, Commander.",BASHIR
"In fact, Chief O'Brien, I think you should place a monitoring device on me.",BASHIR
"Well, just in case he's up to something?",BASHIR
Medical assistance to Ops.,BASHIR
"Second degree burns, lacerations, a minor concussion.",BASHIR
Not much compared to what he's been through before.,BASHIR
"The most recent of these scars is only two, perhaps three years old.",BASHIR
It's remarkable you lived through this.,BASHIR
"I'm sorry, Commander.",BASHIR
He needs rest now.,BASHIR
"And how are you this evening, Mister Garak?",BASHIR
"Excuse me, just plain, simple Garak, you said.",BASHIR
"Keeping an eye on the ebb and flow of things, are you?",BASHIR
"Oh, yes, they do.",BASHIR
Ah.,BASHIR
"Plain, simple Garak.",BASHIR
How are you today?,BASHIR
I'm sure of it.,BASHIR
Terrorists?,BASHIR
What are they doing here?,BASHIR
"Garak, I'm a doctor",BASHIR
I really must be getting along now.,BASHIR
A suit?,BASHIR
"We're talking about terrorists, and you want me to buy a new suit?",BASHIR
"Er, yes, I see.",BASHIR
"Well, if you'll excuse me.",BASHIR
(looks at the terrorists) A suit?,BASHIR
Commander Sisko.,BASHIR
I need some guidance.,BASHIR
"It's about Garak, the Cardassian?",BASHIR
I'm afraid this relationship has gotten a little out of hand.,BASHIR
He wants me to buy a suit.,BASHIR
At exactly twenty fifty five tonight.,BASHIR
I don't know but it has something to do with those two Bajoran terrorists on board.,BASHIR
"He says that together, he and I might discover what they're really doing here.",BASHIR
I don't understand why he wants me involved.,BASHIR
"Well, what do you want me to do?",BASHIR
I was just,BASHIR
What's bilitrium?,BASHIR
But if he's got both.,BASHIR
Conspiracy to what?,BASHIR
We don't even know what their plan is.,BASHIR
"O' Major, upper pylon three'll be shut down for maintenance for forty-eight hours.",BRIEN
"O' Confirmed, sir.",BRIEN
They've crossed into Bajoran space.,BRIEN
O' Channel open.,BRIEN
O' No reply from the Cardassians.,BRIEN
The Bajoran vessel is hailing us.,BRIEN
"O' We can only get audio, Commander.",BRIEN
"O' Aye, sir.",BRIEN
"O' Commander, the Cardassians are hailing us.",BRIEN
O' They're hopping mad.,BRIEN
O' Understood.,BRIEN
"O' Sir, the Cardassian warship has docked.",BRIEN
"Lieutenant Dax is making sure that all procedural details are precisely observed, no matter how long it takes.",BRIEN
"O' Sir, I don't know much about the Bajoran terrorists, but you've never fought the Cardassians, have you?",BRIEN
"O' Well, you just wouldn't want to turn a man, any man over to their tender care, sir.",BRIEN
You just wouldn't.,BRIEN
"Subspace transmission from Admiral Rollman for you, Commander.",BRIEN
"O' Once the switch with the Klingons is made, you've got them holding the components to an explosive device.",BRIEN
That's enough evidence right there.,BRIEN
"O' Aye, sir.",BRIEN
O' Dead quiet.,BRIEN
O' The Klingons have powered up their transporters.,BRIEN
O' Bird of Prey is moving off and cloaking.,BRIEN
"O' Intercept in one minute, twelve seconds.",BRIEN
"O' The Yangtzee's sensors should be picking us up now, sir.",BRIEN
O' They've gone to warp.,BRIEN
"O' If that device goes off while they're at warp, they'll spread radiation across half the system.",BRIEN
"O' That's about a minute too late, Commander.",BRIEN
O' Not at these speeds.,BRIEN
They have twenty seven seconds on us.,BRIEN
"We may have to shoot them down, Commander.",BRIEN
"O' Aye, sir.",BRIEN
"O' My God, they're going into the wormhole.",BRIEN
At full impulse.,BRIEN
"We don't know for a fact Garak's a spy, Doctor.",SISKO
"I'm sure they are, Doctor Bashir.",SISKO
"I don't think that'll be necessary, Doctor.",SISKO
Just be very cautious when you're around him.,SISKO
On screen.,SISKO
Mister O'Brien?,SISKO
Open a hailing frequency to the Cardassians.,SISKO
"Cardassian vessel, you are violating Bajoran space.",SISKO
Break off your pursuit.,SISKO
"Repeat, break off now.",SISKO
Open the channel.,SISKO
"This is Benjamin Sisko, Starfleet Commander of the station.",SISKO
Who are you?,SISKO
Why are they pursuing?,SISKO
"Get him out, Mister O'Brien.",SISKO
"Open the channel, Mister O'Brien.",SISKO
He has requested asylum.,SISKO
"To be honest, I haven't decided yet.",SISKO
I'll investigate the matter immediately.,SISKO
"In the interim, if you'd care to dock your vessel, I'll be glad to hear an explanation for having violated Bajoran space and threatened a Federation facility.",SISKO
I stand corrected.,SISKO
Sisko out.,SISKO
The Major and I will be at the Infirmary.,SISKO
I'd like some time to talk with this fellow Tahna.,SISKO
"When Gul Danar comes in, it'd be nice if we had a few docking regulations to keep him outside a while.",SISKO
"Were you part of this Kohn-Ma, Major?",SISKO
You'd still be out murdering Cardassians or even some Bajorans that the Kohn-Ma hold in contempt.,SISKO
Didn't they claim responsibility for the assassination of one of your First Ministers last month?,SISKO
Is he Kohn-Ma?,SISKO
"I suggest you get your priorities straight, Major, because I don't have any room for divided loyalties in this command.",SISKO
And I won't have a Kohn-Ma terrorist using this station as a protective shield for continuing violence.,SISKO
Apparently his war with the Cardassians isn't over yet.,SISKO
Before?,SISKO
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko.,SISKO
I have a few questions for you if you're up to answering them.,SISKO
"Major, perhaps I should conduct this alone.",SISKO
"For starters, why were they chasing you?",SISKO
I assume as a member of the Kohn-Ma you've committed serious acts against them.,SISKO
Any of them since their withdrawal from Bajor?,SISKO
Why would you continue the violence against them now?,SISKO
Well done.,SISKO
I have some more research to do on the Kohn-Ma before I see them.,SISKO
No.,SISKO
In my office.,SISKO
"Yes, Admiral.",SISKO
I apologise.,SISKO
We're still trying to repair all the damage your forces did before they left.,SISKO
It does create unreasonable delays.,SISKO
"Well, we've got a problem.",SISKO
"Danar, in war, both sides commit atrocities.",SISKO
He tells me that he has renounced the Kohn-Ma and wants to help to rebuild Bajor.,SISKO
"I appreciate the Cardassian position but I know if a Bajoran freedom-fighter is turned over to the Cardassians by the Federation, that would be a mistake that would undermine everything that I'm trying to accomplish here.",SISKO
"So, with apologies, I'm going to grant him asylum for the time being.",SISKO
"Eventually, he'll want to relocate to Bajor and if you want to pursue the matter with the Provisional Government, then that's your business.",SISKO
Lursa and B'Etor.,SISKO
"They tried to grab control of the Klingon High Council, started a brief civil war.",SISKO
They've been out of sight since then.,SISKO
We've heard they've been trying to raise capital to rebuild their armies.,SISKO
What are they doing here?,SISKO
I don't like it.,SISKO
Odo.,SISKO
They haven't broken any laws here.,SISKO
You can't just throw them in jail.,SISKO
Keep an eye on them.,SISKO
Any predictions?,SISKO
Good.,SISKO
Done.,SISKO
Be sure to mention it the next time you chat with Admiral Rollman.,SISKO
Go over my head again and I'll have yours on a platter,SISKO
"So, Constable.",SISKO
News about our Klingon sisters?,SISKO
Friends?,SISKO
Tahna with Lursa and B'Etor?,SISKO
Two other members of the Kohn-Ma may be bringing it.,SISKO
Major Kira mentioned that they were on their way.,SISKO
Not quite yet.,SISKO
Major?,SISKO
I'd like to meet the two Kohn-Ma who just arrived as soon as possible.,SISKO
How do they seem to you?,SISKO
Do you feel as secure about them as you do about Tahna Los?,SISKO
"Yes, Doctor?",SISKO
How's that?,SISKO
A suit?,SISKO
Why twenty fifty five?,SISKO
Sometimes communications can't be conducted through official channels.,SISKO
Maybe this is their way of telling us that we have a common enemy.,SISKO
"I think, Doctor, you could definitely use a new suit.",SISKO
OC]: Go ahead.,SISKO
We have nothing to hold them on.,SISKO
they haven't committed any crime yet.,SISKO
Agreed.,SISKO
Not agreed.,SISKO
Major.,SISKO
"Mister O'Brien, you and I will take a runabout to a point behind the second moon of Bajor Eight to avoid detection.",SISKO
"Dax, stay in touch with us on a secured channel.",SISKO
Keep an eye on the Cardassians.,SISKO
"They'll be coming to the party, too.",SISKO
"You get him there, Major.",SISKO
We'll be waiting.,SISKO
OC]: Go ahead.,SISKO
"Understood, Lieutenant.",SISKO
Shut down all main power systems.,SISKO
Prepare to go to full impulse.,SISKO
Set up an intercept course for the runabout.,SISKO
OC]: Ganges.,SISKO
Acknowledged.,SISKO
Follow them.,SISKO
Ganges to Yangtzee Kiang.,SISKO
"OC]: Drop out of warp, or we will open fire.",SISKO
OC]: Repeat.,SISKO
Reduce your power immediately or we will open fire.,SISKO
TAHNA: I doubt that he'll shoot while his Major is on board.,SISKO
But just in case.,SISKO
This is the voice of the Kohn-Ma.,SISKO
He's headed straight back for the station.,SISKO
This is the Federation vessel Ganges to Cardassian warship Aldara.,SISKO
"Gul Danar, the Federation runabout Yangtzee Kiang is carrying an explosive bilitrium device.",SISKO
Can you intercept before it reaches the space station?,SISKO
Can we get them in a tractor beam?,SISKO
"Ready photons, Chief.",SISKO
We'll fire as soon as they slow to impulse.,SISKO
OC]: Sisko to Kira.,SISKO
"Are you all right, Major?",SISKO
"OC]: Listen to me carefully, Tahna.",SISKO
You can either surrender now to me or you can wait for the Cardassian warship,SISKO
OC]: And I can let them deal with you this time.,SISKO
Your choice.,SISKO
"What do you think he might want from you, Julian?",DAX
The Bajoran scout ship is badly damaged.,DAX
Structural integrity is failing.,DAX
He's breaking up.,DAX
Acknowledged.,DAX
DS Nine to Ganges.,DAX
OC]: They're in the Yangtzee Kiang.,DAX
They're initialising pre-launch systems now.,DAX
DS Nine to Ganges.,DAX
"The Cardassian warship Aldara is crossing the border, Benjamin, on an intercept course with the Yangtzee Kiang.",DAX
They'll enter,DAX
OC]: Bajoran space in twenty nine seconds.,DAX
(who's had a hair cut) Commander?,KIRA
We've got a small craft taking evasive action.,KIRA
Cardassian war vessel in pursuit.,KIRA
That's Bajoran.,KIRA
That damned Cardassian's firing at a Bajoran scout ship in Bajoran space!,KIRA
His name is Tahna Los.,KIRA
We fought together in the underground.,KIRA
Now they want to talk.,KIRA
You're not seriously considering handing Tahna over to the Cardassians?,KIRA
"If I had been, I would not be working with the provisional government now.",KIRA
"Look, I know Tahna.",KIRA
"Yes, but",KIRA
"My priorities are straight, Commander.",KIRA
Let's not be confused here.,KIRA
"my loyalties are to Bajor, and Bajor needs men like Tahna Los.",KIRA
"If Bajor is ever to rebuild a strong and independent society, it will require the repatriation of splinter groups like the Kohn-Ma.",KIRA
"You have, we have, an opportunity here, Commander.",KIRA
I hope you don't miss it.,KIRA
How is he?,KIRA
It's a Cardassian technique designed to keep you alive.,KIRA
"Commander Sisko hasn't decided whether to grant you asylum yet, Tahna.",KIRA
I'm the liaison officer to the Federation here.,KIRA
Still fighting for Bajor in my own way.,KIRA
I'll stop by later.,KIRA
"Admiral, I think Commander Sisko's being incredibly short-sighted.",KIRA
He obviously doesn't understand the issues involved.,KIRA
"Thank you, Admiral.",KIRA
It's all right.,KIRA
You're safe.,KIRA
It's good to be with someone who knows what it's been like out there.,KIRA
Never.,KIRA
Ask Sisko about that.,KIRA
Oil and water.,KIRA
You're tired.,KIRA
I should go.,KIRA
Over my dead body.,KIRA
How long since you've slept in a comfortable bed?,KIRA
I'm glad you're here.,KIRA
"We need you, Tahna.",KIRA
I mean Bajor needs you.,KIRA
"If you had the impression that I'm a Federation officer in any way, I promise you I",KIRA
"I am, but",KIRA
"Somebody has to coordinate relations between the Federation and the Provisional Government, At least with someone like me here",KIRA
I know,KIRA
"Things have changed, Tahna.",KIRA
With the discovery of the wormhole,KIRA
"Look, I don't want the Federation here any more than you do but they are serving a purpose.",KIRA
"For the time being, at least.",KIRA
"Without the Federation, the Cardassians would be back in a minute to take control of the wormhole.",KIRA
"And the wormhole is the future of Bajor, Tahna.",KIRA
It's bringing ships and commerce.,KIRA
It's making us a power in the quadrant.,KIRA
We have it back.,KIRA
"And as we grow stronger, we'll be able to defend it ourselves without having to lean on the Federation or anyone else.",KIRA
I know it's difficult to see.,KIRA
"After all we've been through, we want it all now.",KIRA
But with people like you leading the way,KIRA
"Tahna, I've put myself on the line for you here.",KIRA
You are finished with the Kohn-Ma?,KIRA
I've been talking with several of the ministers of the Provisional Government about amnesty.,KIRA
For you and any member of the Kohn-Ma who follows you.,KIRA
"I'm working on it, Tahna.",KIRA
I'll find a way to make it happen.,KIRA
I've managed to arrange a hearing of the Ministers' Court.,KIRA
"I have two of the ministers, the smart ones, ready to vote for amnesty.",KIRA
I'm sure one of the others will fall in line.,KIRA
And Tahna says two more of the Kohn-Ma are willing to follow him if you'll guarantee their safety.,KIRA
"I have to say this, Commander.",KIRA
When we first talked I wasn't sure you.,KIRA
This wouldn't have been possible without your support.,KIRA
I want you to know it's appreciated.,KIRA
Sir.,KIRA
I have the third minister's vote.,KIRA
The hearing is simply a formality now.,KIRA
"You are going to receive amnesty, Tahna.",KIRA
Me?,KIRA
A politician?,KIRA
"No, I don't think so.",KIRA
I'm just determined.,KIRA
I think they all simply get tired of hearing my voice.,KIRA
What are you talking about?,KIRA
You knew I was here before you even came.,KIRA
"Tahna, I trusted you.",KIRA
I'm still fighting for it.,KIRA
That's not fair.,KIRA
"I don't want the Federation here, but for now",KIRA
If you expect me to help you commit some act of violence against the Federation,KIRA
"You've already lied to me, Tahna.",KIRA
I know how the game works.,KIRA
Just what is this peaceful plan?,KIRA
How?,KIRA
How do you know I won't just go straight to Sisko?,KIRA
Commander.,KIRA
Of course.,KIRA
I'll arrange it.,KIRA
Sir?,KIRA
Absolutely.,KIRA
Busy?,KIRA
Are all the security measures in place for the trip to the Ministers' Court?,KIRA
Fine.,KIRA
What's that?,KIRA
"Maybe that's why I've learned to respect your opinion, Constable.",KIRA
Never any pretence.,KIRA
"How much do you know about me, Odo?",KIRA
I've done some things I'm not proud of.,KIRA
"I still have nightmares about the raids on the Haru outposts, but at least I was sure of what I was doing then.",KIRA
You have no more love for the Federation than I do.,KIRA
Maybe there are still wars to be fought and I'm just making a fool of myself doing what I'm doing here.,KIRA
"Either way, I have to betray someone.",KIRA
How could I possibly turn against my own people?,KIRA
They're no different than I used to be.,KIRA
I could just refuse to help them.,KIRA
Ignore the whole thing.,KIRA
Then they'd find a way to do whatever they want to do anyway and I'd still feel responsible for the consequences.,KIRA
It was so much easier when I knew who the enemy was.,KIRA
Chief O'Brien is right.,KIRA
We have to give them a runabout.,KIRA
And I have to be on it.,KIRA
"Commander, Tahna doesn't know if he can trust me as it is.",KIRA
"If I try to stay behind, he won't buy into this.",KIRA
The only way to convince him is if I'm on board.,KIRA
"If Tahna fails, I promise you others will try.",KIRA
At least this way you can find out what they're up to.,KIRA
Bajor Eight in one hundred twenty thousand kilometres.,KIRA
Dropping to impulse.,KIRA
What is that?,KIRA
We've got a Klingon Bird of Prey decloaking dead ahead.,KIRA
Klingons?,KIRA
Why?,KIRA
What is it?,KIRA
It's another runabout.,KIRA
We also have got a Cardassian warship three minutes away.,KIRA
The Klingons must have sold us out.,KIRA
"There's nowhere to run, Tahna.",KIRA
No.,KIRA
You would kill thousands of your own people for this?,KIRA
One hundred thousand kilometres to DS Nine.,KIRA
This is your idea of a non-violent solution?,KIRA
You realise there are hundreds of Bajoran civilians aboard the station.,KIRA
The wormhole?,KIRA
It's not the space station you're after.,KIRA
You can't possibly believe you can destroy the wormhole with that device?,KIRA
"You're only hurting Bajor by doing this, Tahna.",KIRA
"There'll be no further resistance, Commander.",KIRA
"Tahna, the old ways don't work anymore.",KIRA
Everything is different now.,KIRA
I had to do this.,KIRA
One day you'll understand.,KIRA
"OC]: Space station, do you read?",TAHNA
Space station,TAHNA
OC]: Please!,TAHNA
Repeating request for emergency docking!,TAHNA
Please!,TAHNA
My name is Tahna Los.,TAHNA
Request political asylum.,TAHNA
Kira?,TAHNA
"Two and a half, actually.",TAHNA
Major?,TAHNA
"What do you need to know, Commander?",TAHNA
You really want to hear the story of my life?,TAHNA
Any one of a hundred that would lead to a Cardassian death sentence.,TAHNA
"Frankly, yes.",TAHNA
"To be honest, I'm not sure anymore.",TAHNA
"We say we're punishing them for crimes committed against us for over half a century, but I've had enough of the killing.",TAHNA
"Strange to run into each other here, isn't it?",TAHNA
"Wearing that uniform, I thought maybe you'd forgotten.",TAHNA
Working on the inside hasn't dulled that old fire just a little?,TAHNA
Don't get along?,TAHNA
"Kira, do you think he'll give me to the Cardassians?",TAHNA
That's the Kira I remember.,TAHNA
"I can adapt to that part very quickly, thank you.",TAHNA
I don't think the Federation has any use for my particular talents.,TAHNA
I thought you were under Sisko's command.,TAHNA
"You see, that's something I could never adapt to.",TAHNA
Why?,TAHNA
Why should they be here at all?,TAHNA
What right does this so-called Provisional Government have to bring them here,TAHNA
"After everything we fought for, Kira.",TAHNA
"Freedom from domination, true independence.",TAHNA
No outsiders.,TAHNA
"No Cardassians, and no Federations.",TAHNA
"Oh, yes, the wormhole.",TAHNA
I don't want to be a power in the quadrant.,TAHNA
I want Bajor for Bajorans.,TAHNA
I want our homeland back.,TAHNA
"You have adapted, haven't you.",TAHNA
Yes.,TAHNA
"Yes, I am finished with the Kohn-Ma.",TAHNA
"There are some who might, if there were assurances.",TAHNA
It's on its way.,TAHNA
I couldn't stop to get it.,TAHNA
I barely got past the Cardassians.,TAHNA
It will be available tomorrow.,TAHNA
Yes?,TAHNA
I never realised you were such an accomplished politician.,TAHNA
"You manipulate Sisko and the Federation, the ministers of the Provisional Government.",TAHNA
And here we expected to find that Kira Nerys had lost the fire in her heart.,TAHNA
I am Kohn-Ma.,TAHNA
I fight for the freedom of Bajor.,TAHNA
You once fought for it as well.,TAHNA
Stop deluding yourself!,TAHNA
"You say you don't believe in the Federation, you say you don't believe in the Provisional Government, and yet you are their dance instructor.",TAHNA
"Don't be naive, Major.",TAHNA
"Once you're in your comfortable bed with the Federation, you won't be able to get out.",TAHNA
We won't be able to get out.,TAHNA
No.,TAHNA
"No, the violence is over.",TAHNA
That is the truth.,TAHNA
"No one will get hurt in any way, I promise you that.",TAHNA
But I do need your help.,TAHNA
"To do what we plan, we need a small ship capable of warp speed.",TAHNA
I gambled that I could convince you to get it for us.,TAHNA
"In one move and non-violently, we accomplish everything both of us has ever wanted for Bajor.",TAHNA
"I know the game too, Kira.",TAHNA
You know I cannot risk telling you that.,TAHNA
"Well, if you do, we'll both know where your loyalties are, won't we?",TAHNA
An anti-matter converter.,TAHNA
I'm transferring power from the ship's warp drive into the storage cells.,TAHNA
It's all right.,TAHNA
We're here to meet them.,TAHNA
You'll know soon enough.,TAHNA
"Thirteen kilograms of gold-pressed latinum, as promised.",TAHNA
Bajoran independence.,TAHNA
What is that?,TAHNA
They must've been waiting for us here.,TAHNA
How did they know?,TAHNA
Prepare to engage warp engines.,TAHNA
We don't have to go far.,TAHNA
I should have know.,TAHNA
Now set the course for DS Nine.,TAHNA
"If you don't, I'll explode the bomb right here and destroy all six colonies on Bajor Eight.",TAHNA
The question is whether you would kill them by refusing to set the course.,TAHNA
OC]: There is an armed bilitrium explosive device on board this ship.,TAHNA
Fire on us and you will detonate it.,TAHNA
"No one's going to be hurt, Kira.",TAHNA
Adjust your course to take a vectored approach past the mouth of the wormhole.,TAHNA
"I don't have to destroy it, just have to collapse the entrance.",TAHNA
"No more wormhole, no more Federation or Cardassians.",TAHNA
Or anyone.,TAHNA
Drop out of warp.,TAHNA
Now!,TAHNA
Damn you!,TAHNA
"No, she's not all right, Commander.",TAHNA
And if you want her alive you'll do exactly as I say.,TAHNA
Traitor.,TAHNA
"GUL on viewscreen]: Federation Commander, you've taken aboard a known criminal.",DANAR
You will turn him over to us.,DANAR
GUL on viewscreen]: You have not granted it.,DANAR
GUL on viewscreen]: He is Kohn-Ma!,DANAR
Even the Bajorans would not grant his kind asylum.,DANAR
He has committed heinous crimes against the Cardassian people and I demand you release him to our custody.,DANAR
GUL on viewscreen]: We have made no threat to your facility.,DANAR
"GUL  If you require all vessels to endure such lengthy docking procedures, Commander, you're going to have a lot of impatient traffic out there.",DANAR
"GUL  I accept your apology, but not your explanation.",DANAR
What about Tahna Los?,DANAR
GUL  A diplomatic insult to the Cardassian people would be a problem.,DANAR
Delivering a wanted criminal to us would not be.,DANAR
GUL  I can only tell you that we are certain he plans to commit more acts of terrorism,DANAR
GUL  He committed brutal acts of destruction and murder and he must pay for those crimes.,DANAR
"GUL on monitor]: So, we're finally allies, Commander.",DANAR
"GUL on monitor]: Our time to intercept is two minutes, fourteen seconds.",DANAR
GUL on monitor]: If I may take this opportunity to say that I warned you,DANAR
"on monitor]: Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Major.",ROLLMAN
I'll stay in close touch with the situation.,ROLLMAN
"on monitor]: Ben, that Bajoran woman you have working for you interrupted a staff meeting to tell me how she disapproves of your handling of this asylum matter.",ROLLMAN
"I think you have a problem there, Commander.",ROLLMAN
What?,ODO
And we have specific regulations.,ODO
You can leave the weapons or leave the station.,ODO
Your choice.,ODO
Please make it now.,ODO
I'm the one giving you the choice.,ODO
Welcome to DS Nine.,ODO
We have some new guests you might be interested in.,ODO
A couple of Klingon sisters from the Duras Family.,ODO
"You know them, then.",ODO
I ran a security check.,ODO
The Klingons have them listed as renegades.,ODO
Sitting.,ODO
"They went straight to Quark's, but not for the gambling and certainly not for the food.",ODO
They're just sitting.,ODO
Why don't I lock them up and call the Klingons to come get them.,ODO
If they're enemies of the Klingon High Council?,ODO
"You know, Cardassian rule may have been oppressive, but at least it was simple.",ODO
"As you wish, Commander.",ODO
They seem to make friends easily.,ODO
"Our reformed Kohn-Ma, for example.",ODO
Talking about a business arrangement.,ODO
He's paying them for something.,ODO
I don't know what.,ODO
The gold is supposedly on its way.,ODO
How do you know that?,ODO
Do you want her to know about this?,ODO
What can I do for you?,ODO
I told you they'd be taken care of and they will.,ODO
"You know, there's one thing about you humanoids I can't imitate very well.",ODO
Pretence.,ODO
There's a special talent to it.,ODO
It's as hard for me as creating one of your noses.,ODO
More than you probably realise.,ODO
And there's something you're not sure of now.,ODO
Meaning?,ODO
It sounds like you're trying to talk yourself into something.,ODO
Or out of something.,ODO
The only important thing is not to betray yourself.,ODO
Are they?,ODO
Your own people?,ODO
Used to be.,ODO
The Joranian ostrich hides by sticking its head under water.,ODO
Sometimes even until it drowns.,ODO
Odo to Sisko.,ODO
"There's someone down here in security who wants to talk to you, Commander.",ODO
Conspiracy is a crime.,ODO
They're moving into the runabout.,ODO
"Sir, we've had a little problem.",DEPUTY
These two women are just arriving.,DEPUTY
They objected to giving up their weapons.,DEPUTY
Klingons do not surrender their weapons.,LURSA
We are Lursa and B'Etor.,LURSA
Of the house of Duras.,LURSA
"All right, where's the payment.",LURSA
Your safety is not our concern.,LURSA
"You are the clothier, Garak?",LURSA
We are not here to buy.,LURSA
We are here to sell.,LURSA
What is he worth to them?,LURSA
You insult us.,LURSA
We will complete our business with Tahna Los in four hours.,LURSA
We will deliver him a cylinder of bilitrium.,LURSA
This is yours.,LURSA
B' Who are you?,ETOR
B' That was not the arrangement.,ETOR
B' Your gold is.,ETOR
B' Good.,ETOR
"Because if we have made this trip for nothing, you will have made a fatal mistake.",ETOR
"B' Watch your tongue, Cardassian, or I'll rip it out and eat it.",ETOR
B' We understand you still represent Cardassian interests here.,ETOR
B' We have no time for your games.,ETOR
Do you want Tahna Los or not?,ETOR
B' In gold-pressed latinum.,ETOR
"B'OC]: Save your welcomes, Cardassian.",ETOR
Do your people want the Bajoran or not?,ETOR
B' That is not your concern.,ETOR
B' The rendezvous will be on the dark side of Bajor Eight's lower moon.,ETOR
The Cardassians can have him then.,ETOR
B' 'eH.,ETOR
HImaH!,ETOR
"It's Doctor Bashir, isn't it?",GARAK
Of course it is.,GARAK
May I introduce myself?,GARAK
My name is Garak.,GARAK
"Cardassian by birth, obviously.",GARAK
"The only one of us left on this station, as a matter of fact, so I do appreciate making new friends whenever I can.",GARAK
"You are new to this station, I believe.",GARAK
"Ah, you know of me then.",GARAK
What a thoughtful young man.,GARAK
How nice that we've met.,GARAK
You don't say?,GARAK
"Doctor, you're not intimating that I'm considered some sort of spy, are you?",GARAK
Ah.,GARAK
An open mind.,GARAK
The essence of intellect.,GARAK
"As you may also know, I have a clothing shop nearby, so if you should require any apparel, or merely wish, as I do, for a bit of enjoyable company now and then, I'm at your disposal, Doctor.",GARAK
"Oh, it's just Garak.",GARAK
"Plain, simple Garak.",GARAK
"Now, good day to you, Doctor.",GARAK
I'm so glad to have made such an interesting new friend today.,GARAK
Plain and simple.,GARAK
"Join me, Doctor.",GARAK
Enhance my evening.,GARAK
"As a clothier, I do have a keen interest in what the population is wearing from day to day.",GARAK
"Klingons have an odd sense of style, don't you agree?",GARAK
But intriguing.,GARAK
I would say that those two outfits are worth studying closely.,GARAK
Look.,GARAK
"At your service, madam.",GARAK
May I show you our latest fashions?,GARAK
Perhaps some silk lingerie from Kraus Four?,GARAK
I meant no offence.,GARAK
I have few Klingon patrons.,GARAK
"So, is there something you wish to buy?",GARAK
I am only a simple clothing merchant.,GARAK
You are in a position to deliver the Bajoran to Cardassian authorities?,GARAK
"Ladies, ladies, please.",GARAK
Everything is negotiable.,GARAK
"I am no more than what I seem to be, a merchant trying to make the best transaction.",GARAK
"So, let us haggle.",GARAK
"Being observant, Doctor.",GARAK
"There's a time for levity, my young friend, and a time for genuine concern.",GARAK
"The arrival on this station, for instance, of those two Kohn-Ma terrorists.",GARAK
I'm not exactly sure.,GARAK
"But together, we might have some success at finding out.",GARAK
"And once you do have the appropriate answer, I'm sure you'll know what to do with it.",GARAK
"Doctor, I think it's time for you to take advantage of my shop.",GARAK
"If you'll be there at exactly twenty fifty five hours tonight, I promise to show you a suit that will make you into a new man.",GARAK
"Doctor, am I making myself clear?",GARAK
"I want you to buy a new suit tonight at twenty fifty five, exactly.",GARAK
"Quickly, Doctor, you're late.",GARAK
It's twenty fifty seven.,GARAK
"Now just take this and try that on as many times as you like, and stay very, very quiet.",GARAK
"OC]: Ah, right on time.",GARAK
Welcome.,GARAK
"OC]: I can now venture to say, with some certainty, that you will receive the agreed-upon payment on delivery.",GARAK
And what business might that be?,GARAK
"If it requires that those I represent must take extra precautions, it becomes my concern.",GARAK
"A rare crystalline element, that can be an incredibly powerful source of energy.",GARAK
"Provided, of course, one also has an anti-matter converter.",GARAK
"Unfortunately, that's why Cardassians were chasing Tahna Los when he arrived here.",GARAK
He stole one.,GARAK
"Quite right, Doctor.",GARAK
He has the ingredients for a bomb.,GARAK
A bomb of significant destructive capability.,GARAK
"Er, yes, yes, of course.",BASHIR
"I am, yes.",BASHIR
"Though, though I understand you've been here quite a while.",BASHIR
Would you care for some of this Tarkalean tea?,BASHIR
It's very good.,BASHIR
"You know, some people say that you remained on DS Nine as the eyes and ears of your fellow Cardassians.",BASHIR
"I wouldn't know, sir.",BASHIR
"You're very kind, Mister Garak.",BASHIR
You won't never believe who just sat down next to me at the Replimat,BASHIR
The spy!,BASHIR
"Garak, the Cardassian.",BASHIR
He is.,BASHIR
You should have heard him.,BASHIR
He introduced himself and he struck up conversation just like that.,BASHIR
"he was making contact with me, with me of all people.",BASHIR
I don't know.,BASHIR
Federation medical secrets?,BASHIR
"Rest assured they're safe with me, Commander.",BASHIR
"In fact, Chief O'Brien, I think you should place a monitoring device on me.",BASHIR
"Well, just in case he's up to something?",BASHIR
Medical assistance to Ops.,BASHIR
"Second degree burns, lacerations, a minor concussion.",BASHIR
Not much compared to what he's been through before.,BASHIR
"The most recent of these scars is only two, perhaps three years old.",BASHIR
It's remarkable you lived through this.,BASHIR
"I'm sorry, Commander.",BASHIR
He needs rest now.,BASHIR
"And how are you this evening, Mister Garak?",BASHIR
"Excuse me, just plain, simple Garak, you said.",BASHIR
"Keeping an eye on the ebb and flow of things, are you?",BASHIR
"Oh, yes, they do.",BASHIR
Ah.,BASHIR
"Plain, simple Garak.",BASHIR
How are you today?,BASHIR
I'm sure of it.,BASHIR
Terrorists?,BASHIR
What are they doing here?,BASHIR
"Garak, I'm a doctor",BASHIR
I really must be getting along now.,BASHIR
A suit?,BASHIR
"We're talking about terrorists, and you want me to buy a new suit?",BASHIR
"Er, yes, I see.",BASHIR
"Well, if you'll excuse me.",BASHIR
(looks at the terrorists) A suit?,BASHIR
Commander Sisko.,BASHIR
I need some guidance.,BASHIR
"It's about Garak, the Cardassian?",BASHIR
I'm afraid this relationship has gotten a little out of hand.,BASHIR
He wants me to buy a suit.,BASHIR
At exactly twenty fifty five tonight.,BASHIR
I don't know but it has something to do with those two Bajoran terrorists on board.,BASHIR
"He says that together, he and I might discover what they're really doing here.",BASHIR
I don't understand why he wants me involved.,BASHIR
"Well, what do you want me to do?",BASHIR
I was just,BASHIR
What's bilitrium?,BASHIR
But if he's got both.,BASHIR
Conspiracy to what?,BASHIR
We don't even know what their plan is.,BASHIR
"Major, upper pylon three'll be shut down for maintenance for forty-eight hours.",O'BRIEN
"Confirmed, sir.",O'BRIEN
They've crossed into Bajoran space.,O'BRIEN
Channel open.,O'BRIEN
No reply from the Cardassians.,O'BRIEN
The Bajoran vessel is hailing us.,O'BRIEN
"We can only get audio, Commander.",O'BRIEN
"Aye, sir.",O'BRIEN
"Commander, the Cardassians are hailing us.",O'BRIEN
They're hopping mad.,O'BRIEN
Understood.,O'BRIEN
"Sir, the Cardassian warship has docked.",O'BRIEN
"Lieutenant Dax is making sure that all procedural details are precisely observed, no matter how long it takes.",O'BRIEN
"Sir, I don't know much about the Bajoran terrorists, but you've never fought the Cardassians, have you?",O'BRIEN
"Well, you just wouldn't want to turn a man, any man over to their tender care, sir.",O'BRIEN
You just wouldn't.,O'BRIEN
"Subspace transmission from Admiral Rollman for you, Commander.",O'BRIEN
"Once the switch with the Klingons is made, you've got them holding the components to an explosive device.",O'BRIEN
That's enough evidence right there.,O'BRIEN
"Aye, sir.",O'BRIEN
Dead quiet.,O'BRIEN
The Klingons have powered up their transporters.,O'BRIEN
Bird of Prey is moving off and cloaking.,O'BRIEN
"Intercept in one minute, twelve seconds.",O'BRIEN
"The Yangtzee's sensors should be picking us up now, sir.",O'BRIEN
They've gone to warp.,O'BRIEN
"If that device goes off while they're at warp, they'll spread radiation across half the system.",O'BRIEN
"That's about a minute too late, Commander.",O'BRIEN
Not at these speeds.,O'BRIEN
They have twenty seven seconds on us.,O'BRIEN
"We may have to shoot them down, Commander.",O'BRIEN
"Aye, sir.",O'BRIEN
"My God, they're going into the wormhole.",O'BRIEN
At full impulse.,O'BRIEN
"We don't know for a fact Garak's a spy, Doctor.",SISKO
"I'm sure they are, Doctor Bashir.",SISKO
"I don't think that'll be necessary, Doctor.",SISKO
Just be very cautious when you're around him.,SISKO
On screen.,SISKO
Mister O'Brien?,SISKO
Open a hailing frequency to the Cardassians.,SISKO
"Cardassian vessel, you are violating Bajoran space.",SISKO
Break off your pursuit.,SISKO
"Repeat, break off now.",SISKO
Open the channel.,SISKO
"This is Benjamin Sisko, Starfleet Commander of the station.",SISKO
Who are you?,SISKO
Why are they pursuing?,SISKO
"Get him out, Mister O'Brien.",SISKO
"Open the channel, Mister O'Brien.",SISKO
He has requested asylum.,SISKO
"To be honest, I haven't decided yet.",SISKO
I'll investigate the matter immediately.,SISKO
"In the interim, if you'd care to dock your vessel, I'll be glad to hear an explanation for having violated Bajoran space and threatened a Federation facility.",SISKO
I stand corrected.,SISKO
Sisko out.,SISKO
The Major and I will be at the Infirmary.,SISKO
I'd like some time to talk with this fellow Tahna.,SISKO
"When Gul Danar comes in, it'd be nice if we had a few docking regulations to keep him outside a while.",SISKO
"Were you part of this Kohn-Ma, Major?",SISKO
You'd still be out murdering Cardassians or even some Bajorans that the Kohn-Ma hold in contempt.,SISKO
Didn't they claim responsibility for the assassination of one of your First Ministers last month?,SISKO
Is he Kohn-Ma?,SISKO
"I suggest you get your priorities straight, Major, because I don't have any room for divided loyalties in this command.",SISKO
And I won't have a Kohn-Ma terrorist using this station as a protective shield for continuing violence.,SISKO
Apparently his war with the Cardassians isn't over yet.,SISKO
Before?,SISKO
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko.,SISKO
I have a few questions for you if you're up to answering them.,SISKO
"Major, perhaps I should conduct this alone.",SISKO
"For starters, why were they chasing you?",SISKO
I assume as a member of the Kohn-Ma you've committed serious acts against them.,SISKO
Any of them since their withdrawal from Bajor?,SISKO
Why would you continue the violence against them now?,SISKO
Well done.,SISKO
I have some more research to do on the Kohn-Ma before I see them.,SISKO
No.,SISKO
In my office.,SISKO
"Yes, Admiral.",SISKO
I apologise.,SISKO
We're still trying to repair all the damage your forces did before they left.,SISKO
It does create unreasonable delays.,SISKO
"Well, we've got a problem.",SISKO
"Danar, in war, both sides commit atrocities.",SISKO
He tells me that he has renounced the Kohn-Ma and wants to help to rebuild Bajor.,SISKO
"I appreciate the Cardassian position but I know if a Bajoran freedom-fighter is turned over to the Cardassians by the Federation, that would be a mistake that would undermine everything that I'm trying to accomplish here.",SISKO
"So, with apologies, I'm going to grant him asylum for the time being.",SISKO
"Eventually, he'll want to relocate to Bajor and if you want to pursue the matter with the Provisional Government, then that's your business.",SISKO
Lursa and B'Etor.,SISKO
"They tried to grab control of the Klingon High Council, started a brief civil war.",SISKO
They've been out of sight since then.,SISKO
We've heard they've been trying to raise capital to rebuild their armies.,SISKO
What are they doing here?,SISKO
I don't like it.,SISKO
Odo.,SISKO
They haven't broken any laws here.,SISKO
You can't just throw them in jail.,SISKO
Keep an eye on them.,SISKO
Any predictions?,SISKO
Good.,SISKO
Done.,SISKO
Be sure to mention it the next time you chat with Admiral Rollman.,SISKO
Go over my head again and I'll have yours on a platter,SISKO
"So, Constable.",SISKO
News about our Klingon sisters?,SISKO
Friends?,SISKO
Tahna with Lursa and B'Etor?,SISKO
Two other members of the Kohn-Ma may be bringing it.,SISKO
Major Kira mentioned that they were on their way.,SISKO
Not quite yet.,SISKO
Major?,SISKO
I'd like to meet the two Kohn-Ma who just arrived as soon as possible.,SISKO
How do they seem to you?,SISKO
Do you feel as secure about them as you do about Tahna Los?,SISKO
"Yes, Doctor?",SISKO
How's that?,SISKO
A suit?,SISKO
Why twenty fifty five?,SISKO
Sometimes communications can't be conducted through official channels.,SISKO
Maybe this is their way of telling us that we have a common enemy.,SISKO
"I think, Doctor, you could definitely use a new suit.",SISKO
OC]: Go ahead.,SISKO
We have nothing to hold them on.,SISKO
they haven't committed any crime yet.,SISKO
Agreed.,SISKO
Not agreed.,SISKO
Major.,SISKO
"Mister O'Brien, you and I will take a runabout to a point behind the second moon of Bajor Eight to avoid detection.",SISKO
"Dax, stay in touch with us on a secured channel.",SISKO
Keep an eye on the Cardassians.,SISKO
"They'll be coming to the party, too.",SISKO
"You get him there, Major.",SISKO
We'll be waiting.,SISKO
OC]: Go ahead.,SISKO
"Understood, Lieutenant.",SISKO
Shut down all main power systems.,SISKO
Prepare to go to full impulse.,SISKO
Set up an intercept course for the runabout.,SISKO
OC]: Ganges.,SISKO
Acknowledged.,SISKO
Follow them.,SISKO
Ganges to Yangtzee Kiang.,SISKO
"OC]: Drop out of warp, or we will open fire.",SISKO
OC]: Repeat.,SISKO
Reduce your power immediately or we will open fire.,SISKO
TAHNA: I doubt that he'll shoot while his Major is on board.,SISKO
But just in case.,SISKO
This is the voice of the Kohn-Ma.,SISKO
He's headed straight back for the station.,SISKO
This is the Federation vessel Ganges to Cardassian warship Aldara.,SISKO
"Gul Danar, the Federation runabout Yangtzee Kiang is carrying an explosive bilitrium device.",SISKO
Can you intercept before it reaches the space station?,SISKO
Can we get them in a tractor beam?,SISKO
"Ready photons, Chief.",SISKO
We'll fire as soon as they slow to impulse.,SISKO
OC]: Sisko to Kira.,SISKO
"Are you all right, Major?",SISKO
"OC]: Listen to me carefully, Tahna.",SISKO
You can either surrender now to me or you can wait for the Cardassian warship,SISKO
OC]: And I can let them deal with you this time.,SISKO
Your choice.,SISKO
"What do you think he might want from you, Julian?",DAX
The Bajoran scout ship is badly damaged.,DAX
Structural integrity is failing.,DAX
He's breaking up.,DAX
Acknowledged.,DAX
DS Nine to Ganges.,DAX
OC]: They're in the Yangtzee Kiang.,DAX
They're initialising pre-launch systems now.,DAX
DS Nine to Ganges.,DAX
"The Cardassian warship Aldara is crossing the border, Benjamin, on an intercept course with the Yangtzee Kiang.",DAX
They'll enter,DAX
OC]: Bajoran space in twenty nine seconds.,DAX
(who's had a hair cut) Commander?,KIRA
We've got a small craft taking evasive action.,KIRA
Cardassian war vessel in pursuit.,KIRA
That's Bajoran.,KIRA
That damned Cardassian's firing at a Bajoran scout ship in Bajoran space!,KIRA
His name is Tahna Los.,KIRA
We fought together in the underground.,KIRA
Now they want to talk.,KIRA
You're not seriously considering handing Tahna over to the Cardassians?,KIRA
"If I had been, I would not be working with the provisional government now.",KIRA
"Look, I know Tahna.",KIRA
"Yes, but",KIRA
"My priorities are straight, Commander.",KIRA
Let's not be confused here.,KIRA
"my loyalties are to Bajor, and Bajor needs men like Tahna Los.",KIRA
"If Bajor is ever to rebuild a strong and independent society, it will require the repatriation of splinter groups like the Kohn-Ma.",KIRA
"You have, we have, an opportunity here, Commander.",KIRA
I hope you don't miss it.,KIRA
How is he?,KIRA
It's a Cardassian technique designed to keep you alive.,KIRA
"Commander Sisko hasn't decided whether to grant you asylum yet, Tahna.",KIRA
I'm the liaison officer to the Federation here.,KIRA
Still fighting for Bajor in my own way.,KIRA
I'll stop by later.,KIRA
"Admiral, I think Commander Sisko's being incredibly short-sighted.",KIRA
He obviously doesn't understand the issues involved.,KIRA
"Thank you, Admiral.",KIRA
It's all right.,KIRA
You're safe.,KIRA
It's good to be with someone who knows what it's been like out there.,KIRA
Never.,KIRA
Ask Sisko about that.,KIRA
Oil and water.,KIRA
You're tired.,KIRA
I should go.,KIRA
Over my dead body.,KIRA
How long since you've slept in a comfortable bed?,KIRA
I'm glad you're here.,KIRA
"We need you, Tahna.",KIRA
I mean Bajor needs you.,KIRA
"If you had the impression that I'm a Federation officer in any way, I promise you I",KIRA
"I am, but",KIRA
"Somebody has to coordinate relations between the Federation and the Provisional Government, At least with someone like me here",KIRA
I know,KIRA
"Things have changed, Tahna.",KIRA
With the discovery of the wormhole,KIRA
"Look, I don't want the Federation here any more than you do but they are serving a purpose.",KIRA
"For the time being, at least.",KIRA
"Without the Federation, the Cardassians would be back in a minute to take control of the wormhole.",KIRA
"And the wormhole is the future of Bajor, Tahna.",KIRA
It's bringing ships and commerce.,KIRA
It's making us a power in the quadrant.,KIRA
We have it back.,KIRA
"And as we grow stronger, we'll be able to defend it ourselves without having to lean on the Federation or anyone else.",KIRA
I know it's difficult to see.,KIRA
"After all we've been through, we want it all now.",KIRA
But with people like you leading the way,KIRA
"Tahna, I've put myself on the line for you here.",KIRA
You are finished with the Kohn-Ma?,KIRA
I've been talking with several of the ministers of the Provisional Government about amnesty.,KIRA
For you and any member of the Kohn-Ma who follows you.,KIRA
"I'm working on it, Tahna.",KIRA
I'll find a way to make it happen.,KIRA
I've managed to arrange a hearing of the Ministers' Court.,KIRA
"I have two of the ministers, the smart ones, ready to vote for amnesty.",KIRA
I'm sure one of the others will fall in line.,KIRA
And Tahna says two more of the Kohn-Ma are willing to follow him if you'll guarantee their safety.,KIRA
"I have to say this, Commander.",KIRA
When we first talked I wasn't sure you.,KIRA
This wouldn't have been possible without your support.,KIRA
I want you to know it's appreciated.,KIRA
Sir.,KIRA
I have the third minister's vote.,KIRA
The hearing is simply a formality now.,KIRA
"You are going to receive amnesty, Tahna.",KIRA
Me?,KIRA
A politician?,KIRA
"No, I don't think so.",KIRA
I'm just determined.,KIRA
I think they all simply get tired of hearing my voice.,KIRA
What are you talking about?,KIRA
You knew I was here before you even came.,KIRA
"Tahna, I trusted you.",KIRA
I'm still fighting for it.,KIRA
That's not fair.,KIRA
"I don't want the Federation here, but for now",KIRA
If you expect me to help you commit some act of violence against the Federation,KIRA
"You've already lied to me, Tahna.",KIRA
I know how the game works.,KIRA
Just what is this peaceful plan?,KIRA
How?,KIRA
How do you know I won't just go straight to Sisko?,KIRA
Commander.,KIRA
Of course.,KIRA
I'll arrange it.,KIRA
Sir?,KIRA
Absolutely.,KIRA
Busy?,KIRA
Are all the security measures in place for the trip to the Ministers' Court?,KIRA
Fine.,KIRA
What's that?,KIRA
"Maybe that's why I've learned to respect your opinion, Constable.",KIRA
Never any pretence.,KIRA
"How much do you know about me, Odo?",KIRA
I've done some things I'm not proud of.,KIRA
"I still have nightmares about the raids on the Haru outposts, but at least I was sure of what I was doing then.",KIRA
You have no more love for the Federation than I do.,KIRA
Maybe there are still wars to be fought and I'm just making a fool of myself doing what I'm doing here.,KIRA
"Either way, I have to betray someone.",KIRA
How could I possibly turn against my own people?,KIRA
They're no different than I used to be.,KIRA
I could just refuse to help them.,KIRA
Ignore the whole thing.,KIRA
Then they'd find a way to do whatever they want to do anyway and I'd still feel responsible for the consequences.,KIRA
It was so much easier when I knew who the enemy was.,KIRA
Chief O'Brien is right.,KIRA
We have to give them a runabout.,KIRA
And I have to be on it.,KIRA
"Commander, Tahna doesn't know if he can trust me as it is.",KIRA
"If I try to stay behind, he won't buy into this.",KIRA
The only way to convince him is if I'm on board.,KIRA
"If Tahna fails, I promise you others will try.",KIRA
At least this way you can find out what they're up to.,KIRA
Bajor Eight in one hundred twenty thousand kilometres.,KIRA
Dropping to impulse.,KIRA
What is that?,KIRA
We've got a Klingon Bird of Prey decloaking dead ahead.,KIRA
Klingons?,KIRA
Why?,KIRA
What is it?,KIRA
It's another runabout.,KIRA
We also have got a Cardassian warship three minutes away.,KIRA
The Klingons must have sold us out.,KIRA
"There's nowhere to run, Tahna.",KIRA
No.,KIRA
You would kill thousands of your own people for this?,KIRA
One hundred thousand kilometres to DS Nine.,KIRA
This is your idea of a non-violent solution?,KIRA
You realise there are hundreds of Bajoran civilians aboard the station.,KIRA
The wormhole?,KIRA
It's not the space station you're after.,KIRA
You can't possibly believe you can destroy the wormhole with that device?,KIRA
"You're only hurting Bajor by doing this, Tahna.",KIRA
"There'll be no further resistance, Commander.",KIRA
"Tahna, the old ways don't work anymore.",KIRA
Everything is different now.,KIRA
I had to do this.,KIRA
One day you'll understand.,KIRA
"OC]: Space station, do you read?",TAHNA
Space station,TAHNA
OC]: Please!,TAHNA
Repeating request for emergency docking!,TAHNA
Please!,TAHNA
My name is Tahna Los.,TAHNA
Request political asylum.,TAHNA
Kira?,TAHNA
"Two and a half, actually.",TAHNA
Major?,TAHNA
"What do you need to know, Commander?",TAHNA
You really want to hear the story of my life?,TAHNA
Any one of a hundred that would lead to a Cardassian death sentence.,TAHNA
"Frankly, yes.",TAHNA
"To be honest, I'm not sure anymore.",TAHNA
"We say we're punishing them for crimes committed against us for over half a century, but I've had enough of the killing.",TAHNA
"Strange to run into each other here, isn't it?",TAHNA
"Wearing that uniform, I thought maybe you'd forgotten.",TAHNA
Working on the inside hasn't dulled that old fire just a little?,TAHNA
Don't get along?,TAHNA
"Kira, do you think he'll give me to the Cardassians?",TAHNA
That's the Kira I remember.,TAHNA
"I can adapt to that part very quickly, thank you.",TAHNA
I don't think the Federation has any use for my particular talents.,TAHNA
I thought you were under Sisko's command.,TAHNA
"You see, that's something I could never adapt to.",TAHNA
Why?,TAHNA
Why should they be here at all?,TAHNA
What right does this so-called Provisional Government have to bring them here,TAHNA
"After everything we fought for, Kira.",TAHNA
"Freedom from domination, true independence.",TAHNA
No outsiders.,TAHNA
"No Cardassians, and no Federations.",TAHNA
"Oh, yes, the wormhole.",TAHNA
I don't want to be a power in the quadrant.,TAHNA
I want Bajor for Bajorans.,TAHNA
I want our homeland back.,TAHNA
"You have adapted, haven't you.",TAHNA
Yes.,TAHNA
"Yes, I am finished with the Kohn-Ma.",TAHNA
"There are some who might, if there were assurances.",TAHNA
It's on its way.,TAHNA
I couldn't stop to get it.,TAHNA
I barely got past the Cardassians.,TAHNA
It will be available tomorrow.,TAHNA
Yes?,TAHNA
I never realised you were such an accomplished politician.,TAHNA
"You manipulate Sisko and the Federation, the ministers of the Provisional Government.",TAHNA
And here we expected to find that Kira Nerys had lost the fire in her heart.,TAHNA
I am Kohn-Ma.,TAHNA
I fight for the freedom of Bajor.,TAHNA
You once fought for it as well.,TAHNA
Stop deluding yourself!,TAHNA
"You say you don't believe in the Federation, you say you don't believe in the Provisional Government, and yet you are their dance instructor.",TAHNA
"Don't be naive, Major.",TAHNA
"Once you're in your comfortable bed with the Federation, you won't be able to get out.",TAHNA
We won't be able to get out.,TAHNA
No.,TAHNA
"No, the violence is over.",TAHNA
That is the truth.,TAHNA
"No one will get hurt in any way, I promise you that.",TAHNA
But I do need your help.,TAHNA
"To do what we plan, we need a small ship capable of warp speed.",TAHNA
I gambled that I could convince you to get it for us.,TAHNA
"In one move and non-violently, we accomplish everything both of us has ever wanted for Bajor.",TAHNA
"I know the game too, Kira.",TAHNA
You know I cannot risk telling you that.,TAHNA
"Well, if you do, we'll both know where your loyalties are, won't we?",TAHNA
An anti-matter converter.,TAHNA
I'm transferring power from the ship's warp drive into the storage cells.,TAHNA
It's all right.,TAHNA
We're here to meet them.,TAHNA
You'll know soon enough.,TAHNA
"Thirteen kilograms of gold-pressed latinum, as promised.",TAHNA
Bajoran independence.,TAHNA
What is that?,TAHNA
They must've been waiting for us here.,TAHNA
How did they know?,TAHNA
Prepare to engage warp engines.,TAHNA
We don't have to go far.,TAHNA
I should have know.,TAHNA
Now set the course for DS Nine.,TAHNA
"If you don't, I'll explode the bomb right here and destroy all six colonies on Bajor Eight.",TAHNA
The question is whether you would kill them by refusing to set the course.,TAHNA
OC]: There is an armed bilitrium explosive device on board this ship.,TAHNA
Fire on us and you will detonate it.,TAHNA
"No one's going to be hurt, Kira.",TAHNA
Adjust your course to take a vectored approach past the mouth of the wormhole.,TAHNA
"I don't have to destroy it, just have to collapse the entrance.",TAHNA
"No more wormhole, no more Federation or Cardassians.",TAHNA
Or anyone.,TAHNA
Drop out of warp.,TAHNA
Now!,TAHNA
Damn you!,TAHNA
"No, she's not all right, Commander.",TAHNA
And if you want her alive you'll do exactly as I say.,TAHNA
Traitor.,TAHNA
"GUL on viewscreen]: Federation Commander, you've taken aboard a known criminal.",DANAR
You will turn him over to us.,DANAR
GUL on viewscreen]: You have not granted it.,DANAR
GUL on viewscreen]: He is Kohn-Ma!,DANAR
Even the Bajorans would not grant his kind asylum.,DANAR
He has committed heinous crimes against the Cardassian people and I demand you release him to our custody.,DANAR
GUL on viewscreen]: We have made no threat to your facility.,DANAR
"GUL  If you require all vessels to endure such lengthy docking procedures, Commander, you're going to have a lot of impatient traffic out there.",DANAR
"GUL  I accept your apology, but not your explanation.",DANAR
What about Tahna Los?,DANAR
GUL  A diplomatic insult to the Cardassian people would be a problem.,DANAR
Delivering a wanted criminal to us would not be.,DANAR
GUL  I can only tell you that we are certain he plans to commit more acts of terrorism,DANAR
GUL  He committed brutal acts of destruction and murder and he must pay for those crimes.,DANAR
"GUL on monitor]: So, we're finally allies, Commander.",DANAR
"GUL on monitor]: Our time to intercept is two minutes, fourteen seconds.",DANAR
GUL on monitor]: If I may take this opportunity to say that I warned you,DANAR
"on monitor]: Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Major.",ROLLMAN
I'll stay in close touch with the situation.,ROLLMAN
"on monitor]: Ben, that Bajoran woman you have working for you interrupted a staff meeting to tell me how she disapproves of your handling of this asylum matter.",ROLLMAN
"I think you have a problem there, Commander.",ROLLMAN
What?,ODO
And we have specific regulations.,ODO
You can leave the weapons or leave the station.,ODO
Your choice.,ODO
Please make it now.,ODO
I'm the one giving you the choice.,ODO
Welcome to DS Nine.,ODO
We have some new guests you might be interested in.,ODO
A couple of Klingon sisters from the Duras Family.,ODO
"You know them, then.",ODO
I ran a security check.,ODO
The Klingons have them listed as renegades.,ODO
Sitting.,ODO
"They went straight to Quark's, but not for the gambling and certainly not for the food.",ODO
They're just sitting.,ODO
Why don't I lock them up and call the Klingons to come get them.,ODO
If they're enemies of the Klingon High Council?,ODO
"You know, Cardassian rule may have been oppressive, but at least it was simple.",ODO
"As you wish, Commander.",ODO
They seem to make friends easily.,ODO
"Our reformed Kohn-Ma, for example.",ODO
Talking about a business arrangement.,ODO
He's paying them for something.,ODO
I don't know what.,ODO
The gold is supposedly on its way.,ODO
How do you know that?,ODO
Do you want her to know about this?,ODO
What can I do for you?,ODO
I told you they'd be taken care of and they will.,ODO
"You know, there's one thing about you humanoids I can't imitate very well.",ODO
Pretence.,ODO
There's a special talent to it.,ODO
It's as hard for me as creating one of your noses.,ODO
More than you probably realise.,ODO
And there's something you're not sure of now.,ODO
Meaning?,ODO
It sounds like you're trying to talk yourself into something.,ODO
Or out of something.,ODO
The only important thing is not to betray yourself.,ODO
Are they?,ODO
Your own people?,ODO
Used to be.,ODO
The Joranian ostrich hides by sticking its head under water.,ODO
Sometimes even until it drowns.,ODO
Odo to Sisko.,ODO
"There's someone down here in security who wants to talk to you, Commander.",ODO
Conspiracy is a crime.,ODO
They're moving into the runabout.,ODO
"Sir, we've had a little problem.",DEPUTY
These two women are just arriving.,DEPUTY
They objected to giving up their weapons.,DEPUTY
Klingons do not surrender their weapons.,LURSA
We are Lursa and B'Etor.,LURSA
Of the house of Duras.,LURSA
"All right, where's the payment.",LURSA
Your safety is not our concern.,LURSA
"You are the clothier, Garak?",LURSA
We are not here to buy.,LURSA
We are here to sell.,LURSA
What is he worth to them?,LURSA
You insult us.,LURSA
We will complete our business with Tahna Los in four hours.,LURSA
We will deliver him a cylinder of bilitrium.,LURSA
This is yours.,LURSA
Who are you?,B'ETOR
That was not the arrangement.,B'ETOR
Your gold is.,B'ETOR
Good.,B'ETOR
"Because if we have made this trip for nothing, you will have made a fatal mistake.",B'ETOR
"Watch your tongue, Cardassian, or I'll rip it out and eat it.",B'ETOR
We understand you still represent Cardassian interests here.,B'ETOR
We have no time for your games.,B'ETOR
Do you want Tahna Los or not?,B'ETOR
In gold-pressed latinum.,B'ETOR
"OC]: Save your welcomes, Cardassian.",B'ETOR
Do your people want the Bajoran or not?,B'ETOR
That is not your concern.,B'ETOR
The rendezvous will be on the dark side of Bajor Eight's lower moon.,B'ETOR
The Cardassians can have him then.,B'ETOR
'eH.,B'ETOR
HImaH!,B'ETOR
"It's Doctor Bashir, isn't it?",GARAK
Of course it is.,GARAK
May I introduce myself?,GARAK
My name is Garak.,GARAK
"Cardassian by birth, obviously.",GARAK
"The only one of us left on this station, as a matter of fact, so I do appreciate making new friends whenever I can.",GARAK
"You are new to this station, I believe.",GARAK
"Ah, you know of me then.",GARAK
What a thoughtful young man.,GARAK
How nice that we've met.,GARAK
You don't say?,GARAK
"Doctor, you're not intimating that I'm considered some sort of spy, are you?",GARAK
Ah.,GARAK
An open mind.,GARAK
The essence of intellect.,GARAK
"As you may also know, I have a clothing shop nearby, so if you should require any apparel, or merely wish, as I do, for a bit of enjoyable company now and then, I'm at your disposal, Doctor.",GARAK
"Oh, it's just Garak.",GARAK
"Plain, simple Garak.",GARAK
"Now, good day to you, Doctor.",GARAK
I'm so glad to have made such an interesting new friend today.,GARAK
Plain and simple.,GARAK
"Join me, Doctor.",GARAK
Enhance my evening.,GARAK
"As a clothier, I do have a keen interest in what the population is wearing from day to day.",GARAK
"Klingons have an odd sense of style, don't you agree?",GARAK
But intriguing.,GARAK
I would say that those two outfits are worth studying closely.,GARAK
Look.,GARAK
"At your service, madam.",GARAK
May I show you our latest fashions?,GARAK
Perhaps some silk lingerie from Kraus Four?,GARAK
I meant no offence.,GARAK
I have few Klingon patrons.,GARAK
"So, is there something you wish to buy?",GARAK
I am only a simple clothing merchant.,GARAK
You are in a position to deliver the Bajoran to Cardassian authorities?,GARAK
"Ladies, ladies, please.",GARAK
Everything is negotiable.,GARAK
"I am no more than what I seem to be, a merchant trying to make the best transaction.",GARAK
"So, let us haggle.",GARAK
"Being observant, Doctor.",GARAK
"There's a time for levity, my young friend, and a time for genuine concern.",GARAK
"The arrival on this station, for instance, of those two Kohn-Ma terrorists.",GARAK
I'm not exactly sure.,GARAK
"But together, we might have some success at finding out.",GARAK
"And once you do have the appropriate answer, I'm sure you'll know what to do with it.",GARAK
"Doctor, I think it's time for you to take advantage of my shop.",GARAK
"If you'll be there at exactly twenty fifty five hours tonight, I promise to show you a suit that will make you into a new man.",GARAK
"Doctor, am I making myself clear?",GARAK
"I want you to buy a new suit tonight at twenty fifty five, exactly.",GARAK
"Quickly, Doctor, you're late.",GARAK
It's twenty fifty seven.,GARAK
"Now just take this and try that on as many times as you like, and stay very, very quiet.",GARAK
"OC]: Ah, right on time.",GARAK
Welcome.,GARAK
"OC]: I can now venture to say, with some certainty, that you will receive the agreed-upon payment on delivery.",GARAK
And what business might that be?,GARAK
"If it requires that those I represent must take extra precautions, it becomes my concern.",GARAK
"A rare crystalline element, that can be an incredibly powerful source of energy.",GARAK
"Provided, of course, one also has an anti-matter converter.",GARAK
"Unfortunately, that's why Cardassians were chasing Tahna Los when he arrived here.",GARAK
He stole one.,GARAK
"Quite right, Doctor.",GARAK
He has the ingredients for a bomb.,GARAK
A bomb of significant destructive capability.,GARAK
"Er, yes, yes, of course.",BASHIR
"I am, yes.",BASHIR
"Though, though I understand you've been here quite a while.",BASHIR
Would you care for some of this Tarkalean tea?,BASHIR
It's very good.,BASHIR
"You know, some people say that you remained on DS Nine as the eyes and ears of your fellow Cardassians.",BASHIR
"I wouldn't know, sir.",BASHIR
"You're very kind, Mister Garak.",BASHIR
You won't never believe who just sat down next to me at the Replimat,BASHIR
The spy!,BASHIR
"Garak, the Cardassian.",BASHIR
He is.,BASHIR
You should have heard him.,BASHIR
He introduced himself and he struck up conversation just like that.,BASHIR
"he was making contact with me, with me of all people.",BASHIR
I don't know.,BASHIR
Federation medical secrets?,BASHIR
"Rest assured they're safe with me, Commander.",BASHIR
"In fact, Chief O'Brien, I think you should place a monitoring device on me.",BASHIR
"Well, just in case he's up to something?",BASHIR
Medical assistance to Ops.,BASHIR
"Second degree burns, lacerations, a minor concussion.",BASHIR
Not much compared to what he's been through before.,BASHIR
"The most recent of these scars is only two, perhaps three years old.",BASHIR
It's remarkable you lived through this.,BASHIR
"I'm sorry, Commander.",BASHIR
He needs rest now.,BASHIR
"And how are you this evening, Mister Garak?",BASHIR
"Excuse me, just plain, simple Garak, you said.",BASHIR
"Keeping an eye on the ebb and flow of things, are you?",BASHIR
"Oh, yes, they do.",BASHIR
Ah.,BASHIR
"Plain, simple Garak.",BASHIR
How are you today?,BASHIR
I'm sure of it.,BASHIR
Terrorists?,BASHIR
What are they doing here?,BASHIR
"Garak, I'm a doctor",BASHIR
I really must be getting along now.,BASHIR
A suit?,BASHIR
"We're talking about terrorists, and you want me to buy a new suit?",BASHIR
"Er, yes, I see.",BASHIR
"Well, if you'll excuse me.",BASHIR
(looks at the terrorists) A suit?,BASHIR
Commander Sisko.,BASHIR
I need some guidance.,BASHIR
"It's about Garak, the Cardassian?",BASHIR
I'm afraid this relationship has gotten a little out of hand.,BASHIR
He wants me to buy a suit.,BASHIR
At exactly twenty fifty five tonight.,BASHIR
I don't know but it has something to do with those two Bajoran terrorists on board.,BASHIR
"He says that together, he and I might discover what they're really doing here.",BASHIR
I don't understand why he wants me involved.,BASHIR
"Well, what do you want me to do?",BASHIR
I was just,BASHIR
What's bilitrium?,BASHIR
But if he's got both.,BASHIR
Conspiracy to what?,BASHIR
We don't even know what their plan is.,BASHIR
"Major, upper pylon three'll be shut down for maintenance for forty-eight hours.",O'BRIEN
"Confirmed, sir.",O'BRIEN
They've crossed into Bajoran space.,O'BRIEN
Channel open.,O'BRIEN
No reply from the Cardassians.,O'BRIEN
The Bajoran vessel is hailing us.,O'BRIEN
"We can only get audio, Commander.",O'BRIEN
"Aye, sir.",O'BRIEN
"Commander, the Cardassians are hailing us.",O'BRIEN
They're hopping mad.,O'BRIEN
Understood.,O'BRIEN
"Sir, the Cardassian warship has docked.",O'BRIEN
"Lieutenant Dax is making sure that all procedural details are precisely observed, no matter how long it takes.",O'BRIEN
"Sir, I don't know much about the Bajoran terrorists, but you've never fought the Cardassians, have you?",O'BRIEN
"Well, you just wouldn't want to turn a man, any man over to their tender care, sir.",O'BRIEN
You just wouldn't.,O'BRIEN
"Subspace transmission from Admiral Rollman for you, Commander.",O'BRIEN
"Once the switch with the Klingons is made, you've got them holding the components to an explosive device.",O'BRIEN
That's enough evidence right there.,O'BRIEN
"Aye, sir.",O'BRIEN
Dead quiet.,O'BRIEN
The Klingons have powered up their transporters.,O'BRIEN
Bird of Prey is moving off and cloaking.,O'BRIEN
"Intercept in one minute, twelve seconds.",O'BRIEN
"The Yangtzee's sensors should be picking us up now, sir.",O'BRIEN
They've gone to warp.,O'BRIEN
"If that device goes off while they're at warp, they'll spread radiation across half the system.",O'BRIEN
"That's about a minute too late, Commander.",O'BRIEN
Not at these speeds.,O'BRIEN
They have twenty seven seconds on us.,O'BRIEN
"We may have to shoot them down, Commander.",O'BRIEN
"Aye, sir.",O'BRIEN
"My God, they're going into the wormhole.",O'BRIEN
At full impulse.,O'BRIEN
"We don't know for a fact Garak's a spy, Doctor.",SISKO
"I'm sure they are, Doctor Bashir.",SISKO
"I don't think that'll be necessary, Doctor.",SISKO
Just be very cautious when you're around him.,SISKO
On screen.,SISKO
Mister O'Brien?,SISKO
Open a hailing frequency to the Cardassians.,SISKO
"Cardassian vessel, you are violating Bajoran space.",SISKO
Break off your pursuit.,SISKO
"Repeat, break off now.",SISKO
Open the channel.,SISKO
"This is Benjamin Sisko, Starfleet Commander of the station.",SISKO
Who are you?,SISKO
Why are they pursuing?,SISKO
"Get him out, Mister O'Brien.",SISKO
"Open the channel, Mister O'Brien.",SISKO
He has requested asylum.,SISKO
"To be honest, I haven't decided yet.",SISKO
I'll investigate the matter immediately.,SISKO
"In the interim, if you'd care to dock your vessel, I'll be glad to hear an explanation for having violated Bajoran space and threatened a Federation facility.",SISKO
I stand corrected.,SISKO
Sisko out.,SISKO
The Major and I will be at the Infirmary.,SISKO
I'd like some time to talk with this fellow Tahna.,SISKO
"When Gul Danar comes in, it'd be nice if we had a few docking regulations to keep him outside a while.",SISKO
"Were you part of this Kohn-Ma, Major?",SISKO
You'd still be out murdering Cardassians or even some Bajorans that the Kohn-Ma hold in contempt.,SISKO
Didn't they claim responsibility for the assassination of one of your First Ministers last month?,SISKO
Is he Kohn-Ma?,SISKO
"I suggest you get your priorities straight, Major, because I don't have any room for divided loyalties in this command.",SISKO
And I won't have a Kohn-Ma terrorist using this station as a protective shield for continuing violence.,SISKO
Apparently his war with the Cardassians isn't over yet.,SISKO
Before?,SISKO
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko.,SISKO
I have a few questions for you if you're up to answering them.,SISKO
"Major, perhaps I should conduct this alone.",SISKO
"For starters, why were they chasing you?",SISKO
I assume as a member of the Kohn-Ma you've committed serious acts against them.,SISKO
Any of them since their withdrawal from Bajor?,SISKO
Why would you continue the violence against them now?,SISKO
Well done.,SISKO
I have some more research to do on the Kohn-Ma before I see them.,SISKO
No.,SISKO
In my office.,SISKO
"Yes, Admiral.",SISKO
I apologise.,SISKO
We're still trying to repair all the damage your forces did before they left.,SISKO
It does create unreasonable delays.,SISKO
"Well, we've got a problem.",SISKO
"Danar, in war, both sides commit atrocities.",SISKO
He tells me that he has renounced the Kohn-Ma and wants to help to rebuild Bajor.,SISKO
"I appreciate the Cardassian position but I know if a Bajoran freedom-fighter is turned over to the Cardassians by the Federation, that would be a mistake that would undermine everything that I'm trying to accomplish here.",SISKO
"So, with apologies, I'm going to grant him asylum for the time being.",SISKO
"Eventually, he'll want to relocate to Bajor and if you want to pursue the matter with the Provisional Government, then that's your business.",SISKO
Lursa and B'Etor.,SISKO
"They tried to grab control of the Klingon High Council, started a brief civil war.",SISKO
They've been out of sight since then.,SISKO
We've heard they've been trying to raise capital to rebuild their armies.,SISKO
What are they doing here?,SISKO
I don't like it.,SISKO
Odo.,SISKO
They haven't broken any laws here.,SISKO
You can't just throw them in jail.,SISKO
Keep an eye on them.,SISKO
Any predictions?,SISKO
Good.,SISKO
Done.,SISKO
Be sure to mention it the next time you chat with Admiral Rollman.,SISKO
Go over my head again and I'll have yours on a platter,SISKO
"So, Constable.",SISKO
News about our Klingon sisters?,SISKO
Friends?,SISKO
Tahna with Lursa and B'Etor?,SISKO
Two other members of the Kohn-Ma may be bringing it.,SISKO
Major Kira mentioned that they were on their way.,SISKO
Not quite yet.,SISKO
Major?,SISKO
I'd like to meet the two Kohn-Ma who just arrived as soon as possible.,SISKO
How do they seem to you?,SISKO
Do you feel as secure about them as you do about Tahna Los?,SISKO
"Yes, Doctor?",SISKO
How's that?,SISKO
A suit?,SISKO
Why twenty fifty five?,SISKO
Sometimes communications can't be conducted through official channels.,SISKO
Maybe this is their way of telling us that we have a common enemy.,SISKO
"I think, Doctor, you could definitely use a new suit.",SISKO
OC]: Go ahead.,SISKO
We have nothing to hold them on.,SISKO
they haven't committed any crime yet.,SISKO
Agreed.,SISKO
Not agreed.,SISKO
Major.,SISKO
"Mister O'Brien, you and I will take a runabout to a point behind the second moon of Bajor Eight to avoid detection.",SISKO
"Dax, stay in touch with us on a secured channel.",SISKO
Keep an eye on the Cardassians.,SISKO
"They'll be coming to the party, too.",SISKO
"You get him there, Major.",SISKO
We'll be waiting.,SISKO
OC]: Go ahead.,SISKO
"Understood, Lieutenant.",SISKO
Shut down all main power systems.,SISKO
Prepare to go to full impulse.,SISKO
Set up an intercept course for the runabout.,SISKO
OC]: Ganges.,SISKO
Acknowledged.,SISKO
Follow them.,SISKO
Ganges to Yangtzee Kiang.,SISKO
"OC]: Drop out of warp, or we will open fire.",SISKO
OC]: Repeat.,SISKO
Reduce your power immediately or we will open fire.,SISKO
TAHNA: I doubt that he'll shoot while his Major is on board.,SISKO
But just in case.,SISKO
This is the voice of the Kohn-Ma.,SISKO
He's headed straight back for the station.,SISKO
This is the Federation vessel Ganges to Cardassian warship Aldara.,SISKO
"Gul Danar, the Federation runabout Yangtzee Kiang is carrying an explosive bilitrium device.",SISKO
Can you intercept before it reaches the space station?,SISKO
Can we get them in a tractor beam?,SISKO
"Ready photons, Chief.",SISKO
We'll fire as soon as they slow to impulse.,SISKO
OC]: Sisko to Kira.,SISKO
"Are you all right, Major?",SISKO
"OC]: Listen to me carefully, Tahna.",SISKO
You can either surrender now to me or you can wait for the Cardassian warship,SISKO
OC]: And I can let them deal with you this time.,SISKO
Your choice.,SISKO
"What do you think he might want from you, Julian?",DAX
The Bajoran scout ship is badly damaged.,DAX
Structural integrity is failing.,DAX
He's breaking up.,DAX
Acknowledged.,DAX
DS Nine to Ganges.,DAX
OC]: They're in the Yangtzee Kiang.,DAX
They're initialising pre-launch systems now.,DAX
DS Nine to Ganges.,DAX
"The Cardassian warship Aldara is crossing the border, Benjamin, on an intercept course with the Yangtzee Kiang.",DAX
They'll enter,DAX
OC]: Bajoran space in twenty nine seconds.,DAX
(who's had a hair cut) Commander?,KIRA
We've got a small craft taking evasive action.,KIRA
Cardassian war vessel in pursuit.,KIRA
That's Bajoran.,KIRA
That damned Cardassian's firing at a Bajoran scout ship in Bajoran space!,KIRA
His name is Tahna Los.,KIRA
We fought together in the underground.,KIRA
Now they want to talk.,KIRA
You're not seriously considering handing Tahna over to the Cardassians?,KIRA
"If I had been, I would not be working with the provisional government now.",KIRA
"Look, I know Tahna.",KIRA
"Yes, but",KIRA
"My priorities are straight, Commander.",KIRA
Let's not be confused here.,KIRA
"my loyalties are to Bajor, and Bajor needs men like Tahna Los.",KIRA
"If Bajor is ever to rebuild a strong and independent society, it will require the repatriation of splinter groups like the Kohn-Ma.",KIRA
"You have, we have, an opportunity here, Commander.",KIRA
I hope you don't miss it.,KIRA
How is he?,KIRA
It's a Cardassian technique designed to keep you alive.,KIRA
"Commander Sisko hasn't decided whether to grant you asylum yet, Tahna.",KIRA
I'm the liaison officer to the Federation here.,KIRA
Still fighting for Bajor in my own way.,KIRA
I'll stop by later.,KIRA
"Admiral, I think Commander Sisko's being incredibly short-sighted.",KIRA
He obviously doesn't understand the issues involved.,KIRA
"Thank you, Admiral.",KIRA
It's all right.,KIRA
You're safe.,KIRA
It's good to be with someone who knows what it's been like out there.,KIRA
Never.,KIRA
Ask Sisko about that.,KIRA
Oil and water.,KIRA
You're tired.,KIRA
I should go.,KIRA
Over my dead body.,KIRA
How long since you've slept in a comfortable bed?,KIRA
I'm glad you're here.,KIRA
"We need you, Tahna.",KIRA
I mean Bajor needs you.,KIRA
"If you had the impression that I'm a Federation officer in any way, I promise you I",KIRA
"I am, but",KIRA
"Somebody has to coordinate relations between the Federation and the Provisional Government, At least with someone like me here",KIRA
I know,KIRA
"Things have changed, Tahna.",KIRA
With the discovery of the wormhole,KIRA
"Look, I don't want the Federation here any more than you do but they are serving a purpose.",KIRA
"For the time being, at least.",KIRA
"Without the Federation, the Cardassians would be back in a minute to take control of the wormhole.",KIRA
"And the wormhole is the future of Bajor, Tahna.",KIRA
It's bringing ships and commerce.,KIRA
It's making us a power in the quadrant.,KIRA
We have it back.,KIRA
"And as we grow stronger, we'll be able to defend it ourselves without having to lean on the Federation or anyone else.",KIRA
I know it's difficult to see.,KIRA
"After all we've been through, we want it all now.",KIRA
But with people like you leading the way,KIRA
"Tahna, I've put myself on the line for you here.",KIRA
You are finished with the Kohn-Ma?,KIRA
I've been talking with several of the ministers of the Provisional Government about amnesty.,KIRA
For you and any member of the Kohn-Ma who follows you.,KIRA
"I'm working on it, Tahna.",KIRA
I'll find a way to make it happen.,KIRA
I've managed to arrange a hearing of the Ministers' Court.,KIRA
"I have two of the ministers, the smart ones, ready to vote for amnesty.",KIRA
I'm sure one of the others will fall in line.,KIRA
And Tahna says two more of the Kohn-Ma are willing to follow him if you'll guarantee their safety.,KIRA
"I have to say this, Commander.",KIRA
When we first talked I wasn't sure you.,KIRA
This wouldn't have been possible without your support.,KIRA
I want you to know it's appreciated.,KIRA
Sir.,KIRA
I have the third minister's vote.,KIRA
The hearing is simply a formality now.,KIRA
"You are going to receive amnesty, Tahna.",KIRA
Me?,KIRA
A politician?,KIRA
"No, I don't think so.",KIRA
I'm just determined.,KIRA
I think they all simply get tired of hearing my voice.,KIRA
What are you talking about?,KIRA
You knew I was here before you even came.,KIRA
"Tahna, I trusted you.",KIRA
I'm still fighting for it.,KIRA
That's not fair.,KIRA
"I don't want the Federation here, but for now",KIRA
If you expect me to help you commit some act of violence against the Federation,KIRA
"You've already lied to me, Tahna.",KIRA
I know how the game works.,KIRA
Just what is this peaceful plan?,KIRA
How?,KIRA
How do you know I won't just go straight to Sisko?,KIRA
Commander.,KIRA
Of course.,KIRA
I'll arrange it.,KIRA
Sir?,KIRA
Absolutely.,KIRA
Busy?,KIRA
Are all the security measures in place for the trip to the Ministers' Court?,KIRA
Fine.,KIRA
What's that?,KIRA
"Maybe that's why I've learned to respect your opinion, Constable.",KIRA
Never any pretence.,KIRA
"How much do you know about me, Odo?",KIRA
I've done some things I'm not proud of.,KIRA
"I still have nightmares about the raids on the Haru outposts, but at least I was sure of what I was doing then.",KIRA
You have no more love for the Federation than I do.,KIRA
Maybe there are still wars to be fought and I'm just making a fool of myself doing what I'm doing here.,KIRA
"Either way, I have to betray someone.",KIRA
How could I possibly turn against my own people?,KIRA
They're no different than I used to be.,KIRA
I could just refuse to help them.,KIRA
Ignore the whole thing.,KIRA
Then they'd find a way to do whatever they want to do anyway and I'd still feel responsible for the consequences.,KIRA
It was so much easier when I knew who the enemy was.,KIRA
Chief O'Brien is right.,KIRA
We have to give them a runabout.,KIRA
And I have to be on it.,KIRA
"Commander, Tahna doesn't know if he can trust me as it is.",KIRA
"If I try to stay behind, he won't buy into this.",KIRA
The only way to convince him is if I'm on board.,KIRA
"If Tahna fails, I promise you others will try.",KIRA
At least this way you can find out what they're up to.,KIRA
Bajor Eight in one hundred twenty thousand kilometres.,KIRA
Dropping to impulse.,KIRA
What is that?,KIRA
We've got a Klingon Bird of Prey decloaking dead ahead.,KIRA
Klingons?,KIRA
Why?,KIRA
What is it?,KIRA
It's another runabout.,KIRA
We also have got a Cardassian warship three minutes away.,KIRA
The Klingons must have sold us out.,KIRA
"There's nowhere to run, Tahna.",KIRA
No.,KIRA
You would kill thousands of your own people for this?,KIRA
One hundred thousand kilometres to DS Nine.,KIRA
This is your idea of a non-violent solution?,KIRA
You realise there are hundreds of Bajoran civilians aboard the station.,KIRA
The wormhole?,KIRA
It's not the space station you're after.,KIRA
You can't possibly believe you can destroy the wormhole with that device?,KIRA
"You're only hurting Bajor by doing this, Tahna.",KIRA
"There'll be no further resistance, Commander.",KIRA
"Tahna, the old ways don't work anymore.",KIRA
Everything is different now.,KIRA
I had to do this.,KIRA
One day you'll understand.,KIRA
"OC]: Space station, do you read?",TAHNA
Space station,TAHNA
OC]: Please!,TAHNA
Repeating request for emergency docking!,TAHNA
Please!,TAHNA
My name is Tahna Los.,TAHNA
Request political asylum.,TAHNA
Kira?,TAHNA
"Two and a half, actually.",TAHNA
Major?,TAHNA
"What do you need to know, Commander?",TAHNA
You really want to hear the story of my life?,TAHNA
Any one of a hundred that would lead to a Cardassian death sentence.,TAHNA
"Frankly, yes.",TAHNA
"To be honest, I'm not sure anymore.",TAHNA
"We say we're punishing them for crimes committed against us for over half a century, but I've had enough of the killing.",TAHNA
"Strange to run into each other here, isn't it?",TAHNA
"Wearing that uniform, I thought maybe you'd forgotten.",TAHNA
Working on the inside hasn't dulled that old fire just a little?,TAHNA
Don't get along?,TAHNA
"Kira, do you think he'll give me to the Cardassians?",TAHNA
That's the Kira I remember.,TAHNA
"I can adapt to that part very quickly, thank you.",TAHNA
I don't think the Federation has any use for my particular talents.,TAHNA
I thought you were under Sisko's command.,TAHNA
"You see, that's something I could never adapt to.",TAHNA
Why?,TAHNA
Why should they be here at all?,TAHNA
What right does this so-called Provisional Government have to bring them here,TAHNA
"After everything we fought for, Kira.",TAHNA
"Freedom from domination, true independence.",TAHNA
No outsiders.,TAHNA
"No Cardassians, and no Federations.",TAHNA
"Oh, yes, the wormhole.",TAHNA
I don't want to be a power in the quadrant.,TAHNA
I want Bajor for Bajorans.,TAHNA
I want our homeland back.,TAHNA
"You have adapted, haven't you.",TAHNA
Yes.,TAHNA
"Yes, I am finished with the Kohn-Ma.",TAHNA
"There are some who might, if there were assurances.",TAHNA
It's on its way.,TAHNA
I couldn't stop to get it.,TAHNA
I barely got past the Cardassians.,TAHNA
It will be available tomorrow.,TAHNA
Yes?,TAHNA
I never realised you were such an accomplished politician.,TAHNA
"You manipulate Sisko and the Federation, the ministers of the Provisional Government.",TAHNA
And here we expected to find that Kira Nerys had lost the fire in her heart.,TAHNA
I am Kohn-Ma.,TAHNA
I fight for the freedom of Bajor.,TAHNA
You once fought for it as well.,TAHNA
Stop deluding yourself!,TAHNA
"You say you don't believe in the Federation, you say you don't believe in the Provisional Government, and yet you are their dance instructor.",TAHNA
"Don't be naive, Major.",TAHNA
"Once you're in your comfortable bed with the Federation, you won't be able to get out.",TAHNA
We won't be able to get out.,TAHNA
No.,TAHNA
"No, the violence is over.",TAHNA
That is the truth.,TAHNA
"No one will get hurt in any way, I promise you that.",TAHNA
But I do need your help.,TAHNA
"To do what we plan, we need a small ship capable of warp speed.",TAHNA
I gambled that I could convince you to get it for us.,TAHNA
"In one move and non-violently, we accomplish everything both of us has ever wanted for Bajor.",TAHNA
"I know the game too, Kira.",TAHNA
You know I cannot risk telling you that.,TAHNA
"Well, if you do, we'll both know where your loyalties are, won't we?",TAHNA
An anti-matter converter.,TAHNA
I'm transferring power from the ship's warp drive into the storage cells.,TAHNA
It's all right.,TAHNA
We're here to meet them.,TAHNA
You'll know soon enough.,TAHNA
"Thirteen kilograms of gold-pressed latinum, as promised.",TAHNA
Bajoran independence.,TAHNA
What is that?,TAHNA
They must've been waiting for us here.,TAHNA
How did they know?,TAHNA
Prepare to engage warp engines.,TAHNA
We don't have to go far.,TAHNA
I should have know.,TAHNA
Now set the course for DS Nine.,TAHNA
"If you don't, I'll explode the bomb right here and destroy all six colonies on Bajor Eight.",TAHNA
The question is whether you would kill them by refusing to set the course.,TAHNA
OC]: There is an armed bilitrium explosive device on board this ship.,TAHNA
Fire on us and you will detonate it.,TAHNA
"No one's going to be hurt, Kira.",TAHNA
Adjust your course to take a vectored approach past the mouth of the wormhole.,TAHNA
"I don't have to destroy it, just have to collapse the entrance.",TAHNA
"No more wormhole, no more Federation or Cardassians.",TAHNA
Or anyone.,TAHNA
Drop out of warp.,TAHNA
Now!,TAHNA
Damn you!,TAHNA
"No, she's not all right, Commander.",TAHNA
And if you want her alive you'll do exactly as I say.,TAHNA
Traitor.,TAHNA
"GUL on viewscreen]: Federation Commander, you've taken aboard a known criminal.",DANAR
You will turn him over to us.,DANAR
GUL on viewscreen]: You have not granted it.,DANAR
GUL on viewscreen]: He is Kohn-Ma!,DANAR
Even the Bajorans would not grant his kind asylum.,DANAR
He has committed heinous crimes against the Cardassian people and I demand you release him to our custody.,DANAR
GUL on viewscreen]: We have made no threat to your facility.,DANAR
"GUL  If you require all vessels to endure such lengthy docking procedures, Commander, you're going to have a lot of impatient traffic out there.",DANAR
"GUL  I accept your apology, but not your explanation.",DANAR
What about Tahna Los?,DANAR
GUL  A diplomatic insult to the Cardassian people would be a problem.,DANAR
Delivering a wanted criminal to us would not be.,DANAR
GUL  I can only tell you that we are certain he plans to commit more acts of terrorism,DANAR
GUL  He committed brutal acts of destruction and murder and he must pay for those crimes.,DANAR
"GUL on monitor]: So, we're finally allies, Commander.",DANAR
"GUL on monitor]: Our time to intercept is two minutes, fourteen seconds.",DANAR
GUL on monitor]: If I may take this opportunity to say that I warned you,DANAR
"on monitor]: Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Major.",ROLLMAN
I'll stay in close touch with the situation.,ROLLMAN
"on monitor]: Ben, that Bajoran woman you have working for you interrupted a staff meeting to tell me how she disapproves of your handling of this asylum matter.",ROLLMAN
"I think you have a problem there, Commander.",ROLLMAN
What?,ODO
And we have specific regulations.,ODO
You can leave the weapons or leave the station.,ODO
Your choice.,ODO
Please make it now.,ODO
I'm the one giving you the choice.,ODO
Welcome to DS Nine.,ODO
We have some new guests you might be interested in.,ODO
A couple of Klingon sisters from the Duras Family.,ODO
"You know them, then.",ODO
I ran a security check.,ODO
The Klingons have them listed as renegades.,ODO
Sitting.,ODO
"They went straight to Quark's, but not for the gambling and certainly not for the food.",ODO
They're just sitting.,ODO
Why don't I lock them up and call the Klingons to come get them.,ODO
If they're enemies of the Klingon High Council?,ODO
"You know, Cardassian rule may have been oppressive, but at least it was simple.",ODO
"As you wish, Commander.",ODO
They seem to make friends easily.,ODO
"Our reformed Kohn-Ma, for example.",ODO
Talking about a business arrangement.,ODO
He's paying them for something.,ODO
I don't know what.,ODO
The gold is supposedly on its way.,ODO
How do you know that?,ODO
Do you want her to know about this?,ODO
What can I do for you?,ODO
I told you they'd be taken care of and they will.,ODO
"You know, there's one thing about you humanoids I can't imitate very well.",ODO
Pretence.,ODO
There's a special talent to it.,ODO
It's as hard for me as creating one of your noses.,ODO
More than you probably realise.,ODO
And there's something you're not sure of now.,ODO
Meaning?,ODO
It sounds like you're trying to talk yourself into something.,ODO
Or out of something.,ODO
The only important thing is not to betray yourself.,ODO
Are they?,ODO
Your own people?,ODO
Used to be.,ODO
The Joranian ostrich hides by sticking its head under water.,ODO
Sometimes even until it drowns.,ODO
Odo to Sisko.,ODO
"There's someone down here in security who wants to talk to you, Commander.",ODO
Conspiracy is a crime.,ODO
They're moving into the runabout.,ODO
"Sir, we've had a little problem.",DEPUTY
These two women are just arriving.,DEPUTY
They objected to giving up their weapons.,DEPUTY
Klingons do not surrender their weapons.,LURSA
We are Lursa and B'Etor.,LURSA
Of the house of Duras.,LURSA
"All right, where's the payment.",LURSA
Your safety is not our concern.,LURSA
"You are the clothier, Garak?",LURSA
We are not here to buy.,LURSA
We are here to sell.,LURSA
What is he worth to them?,LURSA
You insult us.,LURSA
We will complete our business with Tahna Los in four hours.,LURSA
We will deliver him a cylinder of bilitrium.,LURSA
This is yours.,LURSA
Who are you?,B'ETOR
That was not the arrangement.,B'ETOR
Your gold is.,B'ETOR
Good.,B'ETOR
"Because if we have made this trip for nothing, you will have made a fatal mistake.",B'ETOR
"Watch your tongue, Cardassian, or I'll rip it out and eat it.",B'ETOR
We understand you still represent Cardassian interests here.,B'ETOR
We have no time for your games.,B'ETOR
Do you want Tahna Los or not?,B'ETOR
In gold-pressed latinum.,B'ETOR
"OC]: Save your welcomes, Cardassian.",B'ETOR
Do your people want the Bajoran or not?,B'ETOR
That is not your concern.,B'ETOR
The rendezvous will be on the dark side of Bajor Eight's lower moon.,B'ETOR
The Cardassians can have him then.,B'ETOR
'eH.,B'ETOR
HImaH!,B'ETOR
